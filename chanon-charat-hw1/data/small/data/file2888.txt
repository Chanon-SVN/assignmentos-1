'''Black metal''' is an [[Extreme metal|extreme]] subgenre and subculture of [[heavy metal music]]. Common traits include [[Tempo#Beats per minute|fast tempos]], a [[Screaming (music)#Black metal|'shrieking']] vocal style, highly distorted [[Electric guitar|guitars]] played with [[tremolo picking]], raw ([[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]]) recording, unconventional [[song structure]]s and an emphasis on atmosphere. Artists often appear in '[[corpse paint]]' and adopt [[pseudonyms]].

During the 1980s, several [[thrash metal|thrash]] and [[death metal]] bands formed a prototype for black metal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stylus Magazine&quot;/&gt; This so-called &quot;first wave&quot; included bands such as [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[Mercyful Fate]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], [[Hellhammer]] and [[Celtic Frost]].&lt;ref name=sam&gt;{{cite video |last=Dunn |first=Sam |year=2005 |title=[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]] |type=motion picture |publisher=Seville Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt; A &quot;second wave&quot; arose in the early 1990s, spearheaded by [[Norway|Norwegian]] bands such as [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Darkthrone]], [[Burzum]], [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]] and [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]]. The [[early Norwegian black metal scene]] developed the style of their forebears into a distinct genre. Norwegian-inspired black metal scenes emerged throughout Europe and North America, although some other scenes developed their own styles independently.&lt;ref name=billzebub&gt;{{cite video |last=Debub |first=Bill |year=2007 |title=Black Metal: A Documentary |type=motion picture |publisher=Bill Zebub Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially a synonym for &quot;Satanic metal&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McIver |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel McIver |title=Justice for All - The Truth About Metallica |edition=updated |publisher=Omnibus Press |year=2009 |url=http://books.google.de/books?id=SvW-uN-qEbIC&amp;pg=PT98&amp;dq=%22black+metal%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22black%20metal%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; black metal is often met with hostility from mainstream culture, due to the actions and [[Black metal#Ideology|ideologies]] associated with it. Many artists express extreme [[Anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian]] and [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] views, advocating various forms of [[Satanism]] or [[Polytheistic reconstructionism|ethnic Paganism]]. In the 1990s, members of the scene were responsible for a spate of [[Black metal#Church burnings|church burnings]] and murders. There is also a small [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] [[National Socialist black metal|movement]] within black metal, although it has been shunned by many prominent artists.&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt;&lt;ref name=kingovhell&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maelstrom.nu/ezine/interview_iss50_224.php |title=Interview with Jotunspor |last=Škot |first=Mladen |work=maelstrom.nu |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=infernus1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=93004 |title=Blabbermouth.net - Gorgoroth Guitarist Infernus: 'I Personally Am Against Racism in Both Thought and Practice' |date=15 March 2008 |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, black metal strives to be inaccessible to the mainstream and those who are [[Poseur|not committed]].{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=30}}

== Characteristics ==
Although nowadays, 'black metal' typically refers to the Norwegian style with 'shrieking' vocals and raw production, the term has also been applied to bands with widely differing sounds.&lt;ref name=emperor10&gt;''Emperor''. In: Jon Kristiansen: ''Metalion: The Slayer Mag Diaries''. Brooklyn, NY: Bazillion Points Books 2011, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt;

=== Instrumentation ===
Norwegian-inspired black metal guitarists usually favor high-pitched or [[Treble (sound)|trebly]] guitar tones and heavy [[distortion (guitar)|distortion]].{{sfn|Kahn-Harris|2007|p=4}} The guitar is usually played with much use of fast, un-[[Palm mute|muted]] [[tremolo picking]].{{sfn|Kahn-Harris|2007|p=4}}&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Campion |title=In the Face of Death |date=20 February 2005 |publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]] |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1419364,00.html |work=[[The Guardian|guardian.co.uk]] |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chronicles&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/Articles/rants/6-668_black_metal_a_brief_guide.aspx |title=CoC : Rant : Black Metal: A Brief Guide |last=Kalis |first=Quentin |date=31 August 2004 |work=[[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]] |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guitarists often use [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]]—along with specific [[Musical scale|scales]], [[Interval (music)|intervals]] and [[Guitar chord|chord progressions]]—to create a sense of dread. The [[tritone]] or flat-fifth is often used, for example. [[Guitar solo]]s and low [[guitar tunings]] are rare in black metal.&lt;ref name=chronicles/&gt;

The [[bass guitar]] is seldom used to play stand-alone melodies. It is not uncommon for the bass guitar to be muted against the guitar,&lt;ref name=chronicles/&gt; or for it to [[Homophony|homophonically]] follow the bass lines of the guitar. Typically, [[Drum kit|drumming]] is fast and uses [[Heel-toe technique|double-bass]], [[blast beat]]s, or both.

Black metal songs often stray from [[Song structure (popular music)|conventional song structure]] and often lack clear verse-chorus sections. Instead, many black metal songs contain lengthy and repetitive instrumental sections.

The Greek style—established by [[Rotting Christ]], [[Necromantia]] and Varathron&lt;ref&gt;J. Campbell: [http://www.nwnprod.com/?p=2078 ''Varathron &quot;Genesis of the Unaltered Evil&quot; DLP/Triple LP and TS Out Now''], 30 January 2012, accessed on 13 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;—has more [[traditional metal|traditional heavy metal]]&lt;ref&gt;Chad Bowar: [http://heavymetal.about.com/b/2011/06/24/retro-recommendation-rotting-christ-thy-mighty-contract.htm ''Retro Recommendation: Rotting Christ - Thy Mighty Contract''], 24 June 2011, accessed on 13 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[death metal]]&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Glas: ''Rotting Christ''. ''Passage to Arcturo''. In: ''Metal Hammer'', March 1992, pp. 70f.&lt;/ref&gt; traits than Norwegian black metal.

=== Vocals and lyrics ===
Traditional black metal bands usually use raspy, high-pitched vocals which include shrieking, screaming and snarling.{{sfn|Kahn-Harris|2007|p=4}}&lt;ref name=chronicles/&gt; This vocal style was influenced by [[Quorthon]] of [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]],{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=18f}} and is one of the traits that distinguishes the vocals of many traditional black metal artists from those of death metal, which usually uses low-pitched [[Death growl|growls]].

Black metal lyrics typically attack Christianity and the other institutional religions,&lt;ref name=chronicles/&gt; often using apocalyptic language. [[Satanism|Satanic]] lyrics are common,&lt;ref name=murdermusic&gt;{{cite video |last=Dome |first=Michael |year=2007 |title=Murder Music: Black Metal |type=motion picture |publisher=Rockworld TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many see them as essential to black metal. For Satanist black metal artists, &quot;Black metal songs are meant to be like Calvinist sermons; deadly serious attempts to unite the true believers&quot;.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=25}} [[Misanthropy]], [[global catastrophe]], war, death, destruction and rebirth are also common themes.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; Another topic often found in black metal lyrics is that of the wild or harsher aspects of nature – particularly the [[wilderness]], [[forest]]s, [[mountain]]s, [[winter]], storms and blizzards. Black metal also has a fascination with the distant past. There are many bands who write about the [[mythology]] and [[folklore]] of their homelands and promote a revival of pre-Christian, [[Paganism|pagan]] traditions. For more information about black metal lyrics, see the [[#Ideology|ideology section]] below.

[[File:Hindvir Gaulhammer Fest 111008 01 C.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A common black metal trait is the use of [[corpse paint]]]]

=== Imagery and performances ===
Many bands choose not to play live.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Spermeth: ''Besessen von der Dunkelheit und dem Bösen''. In: ''Ablaze'', no. 5, May/June 1995, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=putrid&gt;Ben Ratliff: [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/arts/music/15metal.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all ''Thank You, Professor, That Was Putrid'']. In: ''[[The New York Times]]'', 14 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who do play live maintain that their performances &quot;are not for entertainment or spectacle. Sincerity, authenticity and extremity are valued above all else.&quot;{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=47}} Some bands consider their concerts to be rituals{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=47}} and often make use of stage props and theatrics. Bands such as Mayhem and [[Gorgoroth]] are noted for their controversial shows, which have featured impaled animal heads, mock [[crucifixion]]s, [[List of medieval weapons|medieval weaponry]] and band members doused in animal blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article723414.ece |title=Aftenposten Norway, Norwegian news in English |last=Tisdall |first=Jonathan |date=4 February 2004 |work=aftenposten.no |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few vocalists are known for [[Self-harm|cutting themselves]] while singing onstage. 

Black metal artists often appear dressed in black with [[combat boot]]s, bullet belts, spiked wristbands&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; and [[Cross of St. Peter|inverted crosses]]/[[pentagram]]s to reinforce their anti-Christian or anti-religious stance.&lt;ref name=sam/&gt; However, the most stand-out trait is their use of '[[corpse paint]]' – black and white face paint sometimes mixed with real or fake blood, which is used to create a corpse-like or demonic appearance.

The imagery of black metal reflects its lyrics and ideology. In the early 1990s, most pioneering black metal artists had minimalist album covers featuring [[Xerox art|xeroxed]] black-and-white pictures and/or writing.&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt; This was partly a reaction against death metal bands, who at that time had begun to use brightly colored album artwork.&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt; Many purist black metal artists have continued this style. Black metal album covers are typically dark and tend to be atmospheric or provocative; some feature natural or fantasy landscapes (for example [[Burzum]]'s ''[[Filosofem]]'' and [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]]'s ''[[In the Nightside Eclipse]]'') while others are violent, perverted, sacrilegious and iconoclastic (for example [[Marduk (band)|Marduk]]'s ''[[Fuck Me Jesus]]'' and [[Dimmu Borgir]]'s ''[[In Sorte Diaboli]]'').

=== Production ===
Low production quality was typical for early black metal artists with low budgets, where recordings would often be done in their homes or basements.{{sfn|Kahn-Harris|2007|p=4}} Even when they were able to raise their production quality, many artists chose to keep making [[low fidelity]] (lo-fi) recordings.&lt;ref name=chronicles/&gt;&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; The reason for this was to stay true to the genre's underground roots and to make the music sound more &quot;raw&quot; and &quot;cold&quot;.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; One of the better-known examples of this is the album ''[[Transilvanian Hunger]]'' by [[Darkthrone]] – a band whom Johnathan Selzer of ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' magazine says &quot;represent the [[DIY ethic|DIY aspect]] of black metal&quot;.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; It was also an attempt to make black metal inaccessible to the mainstream and those who are [[Poseur|not committed]]. Many have claimed that, originally, black metal was only intended for those who were part of the scene.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; Vocalist [[Gaahl]] said that during its early years, &quot;black metal was never meant to reach an audience, it was purely for our own satisfaction&quot;.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

== History ==
The following depiction follows a classification according to which pioneers like [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] and [[Hellhammer]] were part of a &quot;first wave&quot; and the &quot;second wave&quot; was begun by the [[Early Norwegian black metal scene|early Norwegian scene]]; especially by [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] vocalist Dead's suicide,&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Ahlig: [http://www.metal-hammer.de/news/meldungen/article299447/marduk-gitarrist-besitzt-leichenteile-von-dead.html ''Marduk-Gitarrist besitzt Leichenteile von Dead''], 5 June 2012, accessed on 9 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Mayhem's leader Euronymous, who founded the Norwegian scene after Dead's suicide,{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=39}} and [[Darkthrone]]'s album ''[[A Blaze in the Northern Sky]]''.&lt;ref name=paganfront&gt;[[Hendrik Möbus]]: [http://web.archive.org/web/20071214012732/http://www.thepaganfront.com/pf.php?show=articles&amp;article=1 ''National Socialist Black Metal''], accessed on 2 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jon &quot;Metalion&quot; Kristiansen: [http://www.vice.com/read/saga-true-black-metal-v15n5 ''The Saga of True Norwegian Black Metal''], accessed on 2 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolf-Rüdiger Mühlmann: ''Darkthrone''. ''A Blaze in the Northern Sky''. In: ''Rock Hard'', no. 269, October 2009, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also other definitions according to which other albums like [[Sarcófago]]'s ''[[I.N.R.I. (Sarcófago album)|I.N.R.I.]]''&lt;ref&gt;Mersus: ''5 Klassiker''. In: ''Rock Hard'', no. 269, October 2009, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Samael (band)|Samael]]'s ''[[Worship Him]]''&lt;ref&gt;sG: ''5 Klassiker''. In: ''Rock Hard'', no. 269, October 2009, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; began the &quot;second wave&quot;.

=== First wave ===
The first wave of black metal refers to those bands during the 1980s who influenced the black metal sound and formed a prototype for the genre. They were often [[speed metal]] or [[thrash metal]] bands.&lt;ref name=sam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharpe-Young |first=Garry |title=Metal: The Definitive Guide |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;black metal&quot; was coined by the English band Venom with their second album ''[[Black Metal (album)|Black Metal]]'' (1982). Although deemed thrash metal rather than black metal by today's standards,&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; the album's lyrics and imagery focused more on anti-Christian and Satanic themes than any before it. Their music was fast, unpolished in production and with raspy or grunted vocals. Venom's members also adopted [[pseudonym]]s, a practice that would become widespread among black metal musicians.

[[File:Venom live at hellfest.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Venom's album titled ''[[Black Metal (album)|Black Metal]]'' inspired the name of the genre]]

Another major influence on black metal was the [[Sweden|Swedish]] band [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]]. The band, led by Thomas Forsberg (aka '[[Quorthon]]'), created &quot;the blueprint for Scandinavian black metal&quot;.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=21}} Not only was Bathory's music dark, fast, heavily distorted, lo-fi and with anti-Christian themes, Quorthon was also the first to use the &quot;shrieked&quot; vocals that came to define black metal.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=18f}} The band played in this style on their first four albums: ''[[Bathory (album)|Bathory]]'' (1984), ''[[The Return (Bathory album)|The Return of the Darkness and Evil]]'' (1985), ''[[Under the Sign of the Black Mark]]'' (1987) and ''[[Blood Fire Death]]'' (1988). With ''Blood Fire Death'' and the two following albums, Bathory pioneered the style that would become known as [[Viking metal]].

Hellhammer from [[Switzerland]] &quot;made truly raw and brutal music&quot;&lt;ref name=ekeroth244&gt;Daniel Ekeroth: [http://books.google.de/books?id=jRRvfWp95FIC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Swedish Death Metal'']. Second edition. Brooklyn, NY: Bazillion Points 2009, p. 244, accessed on 24 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; with Satanic lyrics, and became an important influence on later black metal;{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=10}} &quot;Their simple yet effective riffs and fast guitar sound were groundbreaking, anticipating the later trademark sound of early [[Swedish death metal]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=ekeroth244/&gt; In 1984, members of Hellhammer formed [[Celtic Frost]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.triptykon.net/vcf/band/biography.html ''Biography''], accessed on 24 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; whose music &quot;explored more orchestral and experimental territories. The lyrics also became more personal, with topics about inner feelings and majestic stories. But for a couple of years, Celtic Frost was one of the world's most extreme and original metal bands, with a huge impact on the mid-90's black metal scene&quot;.&lt;ref name=ekeroth244/&gt; [[Tom G. Warrior]] of Hellhammer and Celtic Frost credited English [[hardcore punk]] band [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]] as &quot;a revolution, much like Venom&quot;, saying, &quot;When I heard the first two Discharge records, I was blown away. I was just starting to play an instrument and I had no idea you could go so far.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;J. Bennett, &quot;Procreation of the Wicked&quot;, ''Precious Metal: Decibel Presents the Stories Behind 25 Extreme Metal Masterpieces'', Albert Mudrian, ed., Da Capo Press, pp. 34f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Denmark|Danish]] band [[Mercyful Fate]] influenced the Norwegian scene with their imagery and lyrics. Frontman [[King Diamond]], who wore ghoulish black-and-white facepaint on stage, inspired what became known as &quot;[[corpse paint]]&quot;.

Other artists usually considered part of this movement include [[Kreator]], [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]] and [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]] (from [[Germany]]),&lt;ref name=killyourself&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lahdenpera |first=Esa |year=1995 |title=Northern Black Metal Legends |journal=Kill Yourself!!!

In 1990 and 1991, Northern European metallers began to release music influenced by these bands or the older ones from the first wave. In [[Sweden]] this included [[Marduk (band)|Marduk]], [[Dissection (band)|Dissection]], [[Nifelheim]] and [[Abruptum]]. In [[Finland]], there emerged a scene that mixed first wave black metal influences with elements of death metal and [[grindcore]]; this included [[Beherit (band)|Beherit]], [[Archgoat]] and [[Impaled Nazarene]], whose debut album ''Tol Cormpt Norz Norz Norz'' ''Rock Hard'' journalist Wolf-Rüdiger Mühlmann considers a part of war metal's roots.&lt;ref name=rh307&gt;Wolf-Rüdiger Mühlmann: ''Impaled Nazarene''.

=== Second wave ===
{{Main|Early Norwegian black metal scene}}

The second wave of black metal began in the early 1990s and was spearheaded by the Norwegian black metal scene. During 1990–1993 a number of Norwegian artists began performing and releasing a new kind of black metal music; this included Mayhem, [[Thorns (band)|Thorns]], [[Darkthrone]], [[Burzum]], [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]], [[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]], [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]], [[Carpathian Forest]] and [[Gorgoroth]]. They developed the style of their 1980s forebears into a distinct genre. This was partly thanks to a new kind of guitar playing developed by Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch of Stigma Diabolicum/Thorns and [[Euronymous|Øystein 'Euronymous' Aarseth]] of Mayhem.&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Fenriz of Darkthrone described it as being &quot;derived from Bathory&quot;&lt;ref name=untilthelight&gt;{{cite video |year=2009 |title=[[Until the Light Takes Us]] |medium=motion picture |publisher=Variance Films}}&lt;/ref&gt; and noted that &quot;those kinds of riffs became the new order for a lot of bands in the '90s&quot;.&lt;ref name=revolver&gt;Kory Grow: [http://www.revolvermag.com/uncategorized/web-exclusive-interview-darkthrones-fenriz-part-2-his-thoughts-on-transilva.html ''WEB-EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: DARKTHRONE'S FENRIZ, PART 2! HIS THOUGHTS ON 'TRANSILVANIAN HUNGER' AND HIP''].&lt;/ref&gt; The wearing of corpse paint became standard, and was a way for many black metal artists to distinguish themselves from other metal bands of the era.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; The scene also had [[#Ideology|an ideology]] and ethos. Artists were bitterly opposed to Christianity and presented themselves as misanthropic Devil worshippers who wanted to spread terror, hatred and evil. They professed to be serious in their views and vowed to act on them. [[Ihsahn]] of Emperor said that they sought to &quot;create fear among people&quot;{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=222}} and &quot;be in opposition to society&quot;.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=218f}} The scene was exclusive and created boundaries around itself, incorporating only those who were &quot;true&quot; and attempting to expel all &quot;posers&quot;.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=30, 42}} Some members of the scene would be responsible for a spate of church burnings and murder, which eventually drew attention to it and led to a number of artists being imprisoned.

==== Helvete and Deathlike Silence ====
[[File:Black metal - graffity in euronymous' basement.jpg|thumb|The basement of Helvete, showing graffiti from the early 1990s]]

During May–June 1991,{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=66}} Euronymous of Mayhem opened an independent record shop named ''Helvete'' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] for '[[hell]]') in [[Oslo]]. It quickly became the focal point of Norway's emerging black metal scene and a meeting place for many of its musicians; especially the members of Mayhem, Burzum, Emperor and Thorns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Satan rir media&quot;/&gt; Jon 'Metalion' Kristiansen, writer of the fanzine ''Slayer'', said that the opening of Helvete was &quot;the creation of the whole Norwegian Black Metal scene&quot;.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=39}} In its basement, Euronymous founded an [[independent record label]] named [[Deathlike Silence Productions]]. With the rising popularity of his band and others like it, the underground success of Euronymous's label is often credited for encouraging other record labels, who had previously shunned black metal acts, to then reconsider and release their material.

==== Dead's suicide ====
On 8 April 1991, Mayhem vocalist [[Per &quot;Dead&quot; Ohlin|Per Yngve Ohlin]] (who called himself 'Dead') committed [[suicide]] while alone in a house shared by the band.&lt;ref name=onceuponatime&gt;{{cite video |year=2007 |title=Once Upon a Time in Norway |medium=motion picture |publisher=Another World Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=purefucking&gt;{{cite video |year=2008 |title=Pure Fucking Mayhem |medium=motion picture |publisher=Index Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow musicians described Dead as odd, introverted and depressed. Before going onstage he went to great lengths to make himself look like a corpse and would cut his arms while singing.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Mayhem's drummer, [[Jan Axel Blomberg|Hellhammer]], said that Dead was the first to wear the distinctive '[[corpse paint]]' that became widespread in the scene.&lt;ref name=basik&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/hh-june1998.htm |title=Interview with Hellhammer conducted by Dmitry Basik June 1998 |last=Basik |first=Dmitri |date=June 1998 |work=thetruemayhem.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070823184104/http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/hh-june1998.htm |archivedate=23 August 2007 |accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was found with slit wrists and a [[shotgun]] wound to the head. Dead's [[suicide note]] apologized for firing the weapon indoors and ended: &quot;Excuse all the blood&quot;.&lt;ref name=purefucking/&gt;{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=62}} Before calling the police, Euronymous bought a disposable camera and photographed the body,{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=49}} after re-arranging some items. One of these photographs was later used as the cover of a bootleg live album: ''[[Dawn of the Black Hearts]]''.&lt;ref name=basik/&gt;

In time, rumors spread that Euronymous had made a [[stew]] with bits of Dead's brain and had made [[necklace]]s with bits of his skull.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt;&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt; Euronymous gave some of these necklaces to musicians he deemed worthy.&lt;ref name=sam/&gt; He used Dead's suicide to foster Mayhem's 'evil' image and claimed Dead had killed himself because extreme metal had become 'trendy' and commercialized.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=59-60}} Mayhem bassist [[Necrobutcher|Jørn 'Necrobutcher' Stubberud]] noted that &quot;people became more aware of the [black metal] scene after Dead had shot himself [...] I think it was Dead's suicide that really changed the scene&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bromley |first=Adrian &quot;The Energizer&quot; |title=Mayhem: To Hell and Back |magazine=Unrestrained |issue=15 |url=http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/necro-unrestrained15.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070823101847/http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/necro-unrestrained15.htm |archivedate=23 August 2007 |accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other members of the early Norwegian scene would later commit suicide: [[Erik Brødreskift|Erik 'Grim' Brødreskift]] (of Immortal, [[Borknagar]], Gorgoroth) in 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/norway/bergen/immortal |title=MusicMight :: Artists :: Immortal |work=rockdetector.com |accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=19441 |title=Erik 'Grim' Brodreskift (1969–1999) - Find a Grave Memorial |work=findagrave.com |accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=immortalmembers&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.immortal.nu/band/members.html |title=w w w . i m m o r t a l . n u |work=immortal.nu |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010820145828/www.immortal.nu/band/members.html |archivedate=20 August 2001 |accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Espen 'Storm' Andersen (of [[Strid (band)|Strid]]) in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;Ravn: ''Strid''.

==== Church burnings ====
[[Image:Bergen, Fantoft2.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The [[Fantoft stave church]] &lt;!-- Please add a picture of one of the churches burning, if possible --&gt;]]

Musicians and fans of the Norwegian black metal scene took part in over 50 [[arsons]] of Christian churches in Norway from June 1992 to 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;Satan rir media&quot;/&gt; Some of the buildings were hundreds of years old and seen as important historical landmarks. One of the first and most notable was Norway's [[Fantoft stave church]], which police believed was burnt by [[Varg Vikernes]] of the one-man band Burzum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Satan rir media&quot;/&gt; The cover of Burzum's EP ''[[Aske (album)|Aske]]'' (Norwegian for 'ashes') is a photograph of the Fantoft stave church after its destruction. In May 1994, he was found guilty for burning down Holmenkollen Chapel, Skjold Church and Åsane Church.&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt;{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=93}} To coincide with the release of Mayhem's ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'', Vikernes and Euronymous had also allegedly plotted to bomb [[Nidaros Cathedral]], which appears on the album cover. The musicians [[Faust (musician)|Faust]],{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=94f}} [[Samoth]],{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=141}} (both of Emperor) and [[Jørn Inge Tunsberg]] (of [[Hades Almighty]]){{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=141}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Satan rir media&quot;/&gt; were also convicted for church arsons. Members of the Swedish scene started to burn churches in 1993.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=269f}}

Those convicted for church burnings showed no remorse and described their actions as a symbolic &quot;retaliation&quot; against Christianity in Norway.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=89}} Mayhem drummer Hellhammer said he had called for attacks on [[mosque]]s and [[Hindu temple]]s, on the basis that they were more foreign.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=105}} Today, opinions on the church burnings differ within the black metal community. Many, such as [[Infernus]] and [[Gaahl]] of Gorgoroth have praised the church burnings, with the latter saying &quot;there should have been more of them, and there will be more of them&quot;.&lt;ref name=sam/&gt; Others, such as Necrobutcher and [[Kjetil Manheim]] of Mayhem, see the church burnings as having been futile, with the latter claiming that many arsons were &quot;just people trying to gain acceptance&quot; within the black metal scene.&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt; [[Watain]] vocalist Erik Danielsson respected the attacks, but said of those responsible: &quot;the only Christianity they defeated was the last piece of Christianity within themselves. Which is a very good beginning, of course&quot;.&lt;ref name=blackmetalsatanica&gt;''Black Metal Satanica'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Please do not remove these tags --&gt; [[Abbath|Abbath Doom Occulta]] from the band Immortal said he doesn't support burning churches and was against it saying &quot;The reason we were never, you know, involved in the church burning is because... if you burn a church, the government builds it up again. You know... and uh, the government... uh... takes our money to build it up. You know, we [Immortal] were never part of any of those side activities... And also politics, you know, all that shit.&quot; [[Grutle Kjellson]] from the band [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]] spoke his view on burning churches saying &quot;The church burning as a 'symbolic' act I can understand. I mean kind of a revenge, in a bigger historical point of view. I mean [[Christianity]] has been one of the most violent religions of them all. So in a historical point of view a bigger picture I guess they kind of deserve it&quot;&lt;ref name=sam /&gt;

==== Murder of Euronymous ====
In early 1993, animosity arose between Euronymous and Vikernes.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=117}} On the night of 10 August 1993, Varg Vikernes (of Burzum) and Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch (of Thorns) drove from [[Bergen]] to Euronymous's apartment in Oslo. When they arrived a confrontation began and Vikernes stabbed Euronymous to death. His body was found  outside the apartment with 23 cut wounds – two to the head, five to the neck, and sixteen to the back.&lt;ref&gt;Steinke, Darcey. &quot;Satan's Cheerleaders&quot;. ''[[Spin (magazine)|SPIN]]''. February 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been speculated that the murder was the result of either a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records or an attempt at &quot;outdoing&quot; a stabbing in Lillehammer the year before by Faust.&lt;ref name=ukcrlz&gt;{{cite web |last=Huey |first=Steve |url=http://music.yahoo.com/ar-257375-bio |title=Mayhem Mayhem Biography on Yahoo! Music |work=yahoo.com |date=10 August 1993 |accessdate=24 March 2010}}{{dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vikernes denies all of these, claiming that he attacked Euronymous in self-defense. He says that Euronymous had plotted to stun him with an [[electroshock weapon]], tie him up and [[torture]] him to death while [[snuff film|videotaping the event]].&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt; He said Euronymous planned to use a meeting about an unsigned [[contract]] to ambush him.&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt;&lt;ref name=burzumstory2&gt;Vikernes, Varg: [http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story02.shtml ''A Burzum Story: Part II - Euronymous'']. Burzum.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Vikernes claims he intended to hand Euronymous the signed contract that night and &quot;tell him to fuck off&quot;, but that Euronymous &quot;panicked&quot; and attacked him first.&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; He also claims that most of the cuts were from broken glass Euronymous had fallen on during the struggle.&lt;ref name=burzumstory2/&gt; The self-defense story is doubted by Faust{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=123}} and other members of the scene.

Vikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993 in Bergen.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=120}} Many other members of the scene were taken in for questioning around the same time. Some of them confessed to their crimes and implicated others. In May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of four churches, and for possession of 150&amp;nbsp;kg of explosives. However, he only confessed to the latter. Two churches were burnt the day he was sentenced, &quot;presumably as a statement of symbolic support&quot;.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=141}} Vikernes smiled when his verdict was read and the picture was widely reprinted in the news media. Blackthorn was sentenced to eight years in prison for being an accomplice to the murder.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=141}} That month saw the release of Mayhem's album ''De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas'', which featured Euronymous on guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Euronymous's family had asked Mayhem's drummer, Hellhammer, to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes, but Hellhammer said: &quot;I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record&quot;.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; In 2003, Vikernes failed to return to [[Tønsberg]] prison after being given a short leave. He was re-arrested shortly after while driving a stolen car with various weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Berglund |first=Nina |date=27 October 2003 |title=Police Nab 'The Count' After He Fled Jail |newspaper=[[Aftenposten]] |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article655724.ece |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070308164838/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article655724.ece |archivedate=8 March 2007 |accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vikernes was released on [[parole]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Varg Vikernes ute på prøve |url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=557287 |newspaper=[[Verdens Gang]] |location=[[Oslo]], [[Norway]] |agency=[[Norsk Telegrambyrå|NTB]] |date=10 March 2009 |accessdate=5 September 2012 |language=Norwegian |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vg.no%2Fnyheter%2Finnenriks%2Fartikkel.php%3Fartid%3D557287&amp;date=2009-03-10 |archivedate=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ute av fengsel |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/05/22/nyheter/black_metal/varg_vikernes/6354526/ |work=dagbladet.no |date=22 May 2009 |accessdate=23 May 2009 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The second wave outside Norway ====
Black metal scenes also emerged on the European mainland during the early 1990s, inspired by the Norwegian scene or the older bands, or both. In [[Poland]], a scene was spearheaded by [[Graveland]] and [[Behemoth (band)|Behemoth]]. In [[France]], a close-knit group of musicians known as [[Les Légions Noires]] emerged; this included artists such as [[Mütiilation]], [[Vlad Tepes (band)|Vlad Tepes]], Belketre and Torgeist. In [[Belgium]], there were acts such as [[Ancient Rites]] and [[Enthroned]]. Bands such as [[Black Funeral]], [[Grand Belial's Key]] and [[Judas Iscariot (band)|Judas Iscariot]] emerged during this time in the United States.

A notable black metal group in [[England]] at the time was [[Cradle of Filth]], who released three demos in a black/death metal style with symphonic flourishes, followed by [[The Principle of Evil Made Flesh|a studio album]], which featured a then-unusual hybrid style of black and [[gothic metal]]. The band then abandoned black metal for gothic metal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baddeley |first1=Gavin |last2=Filth |first2=Dani |authorlink2=Dani Filth |title=[[The Gospel of Filth]] |date=March 2010 |pages=48–50 |publisher=FAB Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming one of the most successful extreme metal bands to date. John Serba of [[AllMusic]] commented that their first album &quot;made waves in the early black metal scene, putting Cradle of Filth on the tips of metalheads' tongues, whether in praise of the band's brazen attempts to break the black metal mold or in derision for its 'commercialization' of an underground phenomenon that was proud of its grimy heritage [...]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-principle-of-evil-made-flesh-mw0000025519 |title=The Principle of Evil Made Flesh - Cradle of Filth |last=Serba |first=John |work=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another English band called Necropolis never released any music, but &quot;began a desecratory assault against churches and cemeteries in their area&quot; and &quot;almost caused Black Metal to be banned in Britain as a result&quot;.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=316-318}}

The controversy surrounding [[Absurd (band)|Absurd]] drew attention to the [[Germany|German]] black metal scene. In 1993, the members murdered a boy from their school, Sandro Beyer.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=272}} A photo of Beyer's gravestone is on the cover of one of their demos,&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]]: ''Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity''. NYU Press, 2003. p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thuringian Pagan Madness'', along with pro-Nazi statements. It was recorded in prison and released in Poland by Graveland drummer Capricornus.&lt;ref&gt;Absurd: ''Thuringian Pagan Madness'', Capricornus Prod. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The band's early music, however, was more influenced by [[Oi!]] and [[Rock Against Communism]] (RAC) than by black metal,{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=250f}} and described as being &quot;more akin to '60s [[garage punk]] than some of the […] Black Metal of their contemporaries&quot;.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=295}} [[Alexander von Meilenwald]] from German band [[Nagelfar]] considers [[Ungod (band)|Ungod]]'s 1993 debut ''Circle of the Seven Infernal Pacts'', [[Desaster]]'s 1994 demo ''Lost in the Ages'', [[Tha-Norr]]'s 1995 album ''Wolfenzeitalter'', [[Lunar Aurora]]'s 1996 debut ''Weltengänger'' and [[Katharsis (band)|Katharsis]]'s 2000 debut ''666''&lt;ref&gt;Alexander von Meilenwald: ''5 Klassiker''. In: ''Rock Hard'', no. 269, October 2009, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; to be the most important recordings for the German scene.&lt;ref name=koenige/&gt; He said they were &quot;not necessarily the best German releases, but they all kicked off something&quot;.&lt;ref name=koenige/&gt;

=== After the second wave ===
In the beginning of the second wave, the different scenes developed their own styles; as [[Alan Averill|Alan 'A. A. Nemtheanga' Averill]] says, &quot;you had the Greek sound and the Finnish sound, and the Norwegian sound, and there was German bands and Swiss bands and that kind of thing&quot;.&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt; By the mid-1990s, the style of the Norwegian scene was being adopted by bands worldwide, and in 1998, ''[[Kerrang!]]'' journalist [[Malcolm Dome]] said that &quot;black metal as we know it in 1998 owes more to Norway and to Scandinavia than any other particular country&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Satan rir media&quot;&gt;{{cite video |title=[[Satan rir media|Satan Rides the Media]] |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newer black metal bands also began raising their production quality and introducing additional instruments such as [[synthesizer]]s and even full-symphony [[orchestra]]s.

By the late 1990s, the underground deemed many of the Norwegian pioneers, like Emperor,&lt;ref name=wbm&gt;Wolf-Rüdiger Mühlmann: ''War Black Metal: Die Extremsten der Extremen''.

After Euronymous's death, some bands went more towards the Viking metal and epic style, while other bands went deeper into the abyss&quot;.&lt;ref name=blackmetalsatanica/&gt; Since 1993, the Swedish scene had carried out church burnings, grave desecration and other violent acts. In 1995, [[Jon Nödtveidt]] of [[Dissection (band)|Dissection]] joined the [[Temple of the Black Light|Misanthropic Luciferian Order]] (MLO).&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Biagi: [http://web.archive.org/web/20031005065926/http://www.dissection.nu/biography.htm ''Biography Part One''.

It was said he was killed &quot;out of anger&quot; because he had &quot;harassed&quot; the two men. Nödtveidt received a 10-year sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Biagi: [http://web.archive.org/web/20040216045715/http://www.dissection.nu/killing.htm ''THE KILLING''], accessed on 25 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As the victim was a homosexual immigrant, Dissection was accused of being a Nazi band,&lt;ref name=fearthereturn&gt;''Dissection''.

Many Swedish black metal bands, most notably Watain and Dissection, are [or were] affiliated with the Temple of the Black Light, or Misanthropic Luciferian Order […], a [[Theism|Theistic]], [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]], Satanic organization based in Sweden.&quot;{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=126}} Upon his release in 2004, Jon Nödtveidt restarted Dissection with new members whom he felt were able to &quot;stand behind and live up to the demands of Dissection's Satanic concept&quot;.&lt;ref name=faustleaves&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20040127040134/http://www.dissection.nu/faustleaves.htm ''FAUST LEAVES DISSECTION BECAUSE OF THE SATANIC CONCEPT''], accessed on 25 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He started calling Dissection &quot;the sonic propaganda unit of the MLO&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dissection (band)|Dissection]]: ''[[Live Legacy]]'', [[Nuclear Blast]] 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dissectioninterview2&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071020061147/http://www.dissection.nu/interviews/Interview2.htm ''INTERVIEW FOR THE FANS BY THE FANS''.

A part of the underground scene adopted a [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] interpretation of the church burnings and other acts of the early scene as the re-emergence of ancient archetypes, which Kadmon of [[Allerseelen]] and the authors of ''[[Lords of Chaos (book)|Lords of Chaos]]'' had implied in their writings,{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=176f}}&lt;ref name=paganfront/&gt; and mixed this interpretation with Paganism and an interest in Nationalism.&lt;ref name=paganfront/&gt; Varg Vikernes was seen as &quot;an ideological messiah&quot; by some,&lt;ref name=decibelnsbm&gt;J. Bennett: [http://web.archive.org/web/20080208184453/http://www.decibelmagazine.com/features/may2006/nsbm.aspx ''NSBM Special Report''].&lt;/ref&gt; although Vikernes had disassociated himself from black metal&lt;ref name=decibelnsbm/&gt;{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=102}} and his neo-Nazism had nothing to do with that subculture.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=102}} This led to the rise of [[National Socialist black metal]] (NSBM), which Hendrik Möbus of [[Absurd (band)|Absurd]] calls &quot;the logical conclusion&quot; of the Norwegian black metal &quot;movement&quot;.&lt;ref name=paganfront/&gt; Other parts of the scene oppose NSBM as it is &quot;indelibly linked with Asá Trŭ and opposed to Satanism&quot;, or look upon Nazism &quot;with vague skepticism and indifference&quot;.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=99}} Members of the NSBM scene, among others, see the Norwegian bands as [[poseur]]s whose &quot;ideology is cheap&quot;, although they still respect Vikernes and Burzum, whom Grand Belial's Key vocalist Richard Mills called &quot;the only Norwegian band that remains unapologetic and literally convicted of his beliefs&quot;.&lt;ref name=decibelnsbm/&gt;

In France, besides Les Légions Noires (The Black Legions), a NSBM scene arose. Members of French band Funeral desecrated a grave in [[Toulon]] in June 1996, and a 19-year-old black metal fan stabbed a priest to death in [[Mulhouse]] on Christmas Eve 1996.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=312-315}} According to MkM of [[Antaeus (band)|Antaeus]], the early French scene &quot;was quite easy to divide: either you were NSBM and you had the support from zine and the audience, or you were part of the black legions and you had that 'cult' aura&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ankit: [http://infernal-dominion.blogspot.de/2011/08/interview-with-mkm-from-antaeus-and.html ''Interview with MKM from Antaeus and Aosoth (French Black Metal)''], 23 August 2011, accessed on 31 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Many French bands, like [[Deathspell Omega]] and Aosoth, have an avantgarde approach&lt;ref&gt;Jan Jaedike: ''Merrimack''.

In Australia, a scene led by bands like [[Deströyer 666]], [[Vomitor]], [[Hobbs' Angel of Death]], [[Nocturnal Graves]] and [[Gospel of the Horns]] arose. This scene's typical style is a mixture of old school black metal and raw thrash metal influenced by old Celtic Frost, Bathory, Venom and Sodom but also with its own elements.&lt;ref&gt;Götz Kühnemund: ''Gospel of the Horns''.

The early American black metal bands remained underground. Some of them—like [[Grand Belial's Key]] and [[Judas Iscariot (band)|Judas Iscariot]]—joined an international NSBM organization called the Pagan Front, although Judas Iscariot sole member [[Andrew Harris (musician)|Akhenaten]] left the organization.&lt;ref name=mh82007&gt;Gunnar Sauermann: ''Special: Black Metal in den USA''.

[[Janaza (musician)|Janaza]], believed to be [[Iraq]]'s first female black metal artist, released the demo ''Burning Quran Ceremony'' in 2010. Its frontwoman, Anahita, said that her parents and brother were killed by a [[suicide bomb]] during the [[Iraq War]].

== Stylistic divisions ==
Regarding the sound of black metal, there are two conflicting groups within the genre: &quot;those that stay true to the genre's roots, and those that introduce progressive elements&quot;.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; The former believe that the music should always be [[Minimalism|minimalist]] – performed only with the standard guitar-bass-drums setup and recorded in a [[low fidelity]] style. One supporter of this train of thought is [[Blake Judd]] of [[Nachtmystium]], who has rejected labeling his band black metal for its departure from the genre's typical sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyherald.com/story/?id=208961 |title=Daily Herald &amp;#124; Nachtmystium shines black light on black metal |last=Pizek |first=Jeff |date=20 June 2008 |work=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|dailyherald.com]] |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snorre Ruch of [[Thorns (band)|Thorns]], on the other hand, has said that modern black metal is &quot;too narrow&quot; and believes that this was &quot;not the idea at the beginning&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.voicesfromthedarkside.de/interviews/thorns.htm |title=Thorns |work=voicesfromthedarkside.de |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1990s, different styles of black metal have emerged and some have melded Norwegian-style black metal with other genres.
* '''[[Symphonic black metal]]''' is a style of black metal that incorporates [[Symphony|symphonic]] and [[orchestra]]l elements. This may include the usage of instruments found in symphony orchestras (piano, violin, [[cello]], flute and keyboards), &quot;clean&quot; or operatic vocals and guitars with less distortion.&lt;!-- Please do not add bands, as there is a list in the main article. --&gt;
* '''[[Viking metal]]''' is characterized by a common lyrical and thematic focus on [[Norse mythology]], [[Norse religion|Norse paganism]], and the [[Viking Age]]. With origins in black metal and [[Nordic folk music]], it is typically manifested as Nordic folk-influenced black metal. Some common traits include a slow paced and heavy riffing style, anthemic choruses, use of both clean and harsh vocals, a frequent reliance on [[folk instrument]]ation, and, often, the use of [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] for atmospheric effect. Viking metal developed in the 1980s through the mid-1990s as a rejection of [[Satanism]] and the [[occult]], instead [[Viking revival|embracing]] the [[Vikings]] and [[Germanic neopaganism|paganism]] as the leaders of opposition to [[Christianity]]. It is similar, in lyrics, sound, and thematic imagery, to [[pagan metal]], but pagan metal has a broader mythological focus and utilizes folk instrumentation more extensively. The origin of Viking metal can be traced to the albums ''[[Blood Fire Death]]'' (1988) and ''[[Hammerheart]]'' (1990) by Swedish band [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bathory-mn0000151787 |title=Bathory |last=Rivadavia |first=Eduardo |work=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]], [[Burzum]], [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], [[Storm (Norwegian band)|Storm]] and [[Falkenbach]] helped further develop the genre in the early through mid-1990s. Though originated from black metal, some death metal bands such as [[Unleashed (band)|Unleashed]] and [[Amon Amarth]] are included in the style.
* '''[[Pagan metal]]''' is metal music with lyrics and imagery that focus on paganism. The Norwegian band [[In the Woods...]] was one of the first bands commonly viewed as pagan metal.&lt;ref name=halupczok/&gt; In the mid-1990s, [[Ireland|Irish]] bands such as [[Cruachan (band)|Cruachan]]&lt;ref name=bolther&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rock-impressions.com/cruachan_inter1e.htm |title=Rock Impressions - Interviews - Cruachan |last=Bolther |first=Giancarlo |work=rock-impressions.com |accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Primordial (band)|Primordial]]&lt;ref name=halupczok/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/primordial-mn0000854587 |title=Primordial |last=Monger |first=James Christopher |work=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; began to combine black metal with [[folk music of Ireland|Irish folk music]].

Unlike other kinds of metal, black metal is associated with an ideology and ethos. It is fiercely [[anti-Christian sentiment|opposed to Christianity]]&lt;ref name=sam/&gt; and the other main [[Organized religion|institutional religions]]. Many black metal bands are [[Satanism|Satanists]] and see Satanism as a key part of black metal.

Dissatisfied with a &quot;world that they feel is devoid of spiritual and cultural significance&quot;,{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=129}} they try to leave or &quot;transcend&quot; their &quot;mundane physical forms&quot; and become one with the divine.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=4}} This is done through their concerts, which he describes as &quot;musical rituals&quot; that involve self-mortification and taking on an alternative, &quot;spiritual persona&quot; (for example by the wearing of costume and face paint).{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=50}}

=== Satanism ===
[[File:Pentagram4.svg|thumb|150px|right|The [[pentagram]] is commonly used by bands in the genre]]

Black metal was originally a term for extreme metal bands with Satanic lyrics and imagery. However, most of the 'first wave' bands (including Venom, who coined the term 'black metal') were not Satanists and merely used it to provoke. One of the few exceptions was [[Mercyful Fate]] singer and [[Church of Satan]] member [[King Diamond]], whom [[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]] calls &quot;one of the only performers of the '80s Satanic metal who was more than just a [[poseur]] using a devilish image for [[shock value]]&quot;.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=16}}

In the early 1990s, many Norwegian black metalers presented themselves as genuine Devil worshippers.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=7f}} Mayhem's Euronymous was the key figure behind this.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=27f}} They attacked the Church of Satan for its &quot;freedom and life-loving&quot; views;&lt;ref name=killyourself2&gt;Esa Lahdenpera: [http://web.archive.org/web/20120207234358/http://www.fmp666.com/moonlight/mayhem.html ''Northern Black Metal Legends''].

Benjamin Hedge Olson wrote that they &quot;transform[ed] Venom's quasi-Satanic stage theatrics into a form of cultural expression unique from other forms of metal or Satanism&quot; and &quot;abandoned the mundane identities and ambitions of other forms of metal in favor of religious and ideological fanaticism&quot;.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=27f}} Some prominent scene members—such as Euronymous and Faust&lt;ref name=emperor10/&gt;&lt;ref name=killyourself/&gt;—stated that only bands who are Satanists can be called 'black metal'.

=== National Socialist black metal ===
{{Main|National Socialist black metal}}

National Socialist black metal (NSBM) is black metal by artists who promote [[neo-Nazism]] or similar beliefs through their lyrics and imagery. Their ideology typically melds aspects of neo-Nazism or [[White nationalism]] with ethnic European paganism. However, some bands meld these beliefs with Satanism or occultism. Some commentators see this ideology as a natural extension of the black metal worldview. Varg Vikernes is credited with popularizing such views within the scene,{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|2003|p=303}}{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=103}} although he now refers to his ideology as '[[Odalism]]'.&lt;ref name=burzum.org&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story07.shtml |title=A Burzum Story: Part VII - The Nazi Ghost |last=Vikernes |first=Varg |authorlink=Varg Vikernes |date=July 2005 |work=burzum.org |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NSBM movement began to emerge in the mid-1990s and was spearheaded by artists such as Absurd (from Germany), [[Graveland]], [[Infernum]] and Veles (from Poland), [[Nokturnal Mortum]] (from Ukraine) and [[Grand Belial's Key]] (from USA). It is particularly strong in the former [[Eastern Bloc]]. Some black metal bands have made references to Nazi Germany for shock value, causing them to be wrongly labeled as NSBM.

NSBM artists are a small minority within black metal, according to Mattias Gardell&lt;ref&gt;Gardell, Mattias. ''[[Gods of the Blood]]'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; and Benjamin Hedge Olson.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=123f}} They have been criticized by some prominent and influential black metal artists – including [[Jon Nödtveidt]],&lt;ref name=dissection/&gt; [[Tormentor (musician)|Tormentor]],&lt;ref name=tormentor&gt;Metal Heart 2/00&lt;/ref&gt; [[King ov Hell]],&lt;ref name=kingovhell&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maelstrom.nu/ezine/interview_iss50_224.php |title=Interview with Jotunspor |work=maelstrum.nu |last=Škot |first=Mladen |year=2004 |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Infernus]],&lt;ref name=infernus1/&gt; [[Dark Funeral]],&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt;&lt;ref name=caligulayoutube&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp_hTvOVSHQ |title=YouTube - Dark Funeral- Interview(Episode 276) |work=[[YouTube]] |date=5 April 2009 |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Lederer (musician)|Richard Lederer]],&lt;ref name=protector&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.summoning.info/Stuff/PoliticalStatements.html |title=Political Statements from Protector (Summoning) |work=summoning.info |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Ford,&lt;ref name=michaelford&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fmp666.com/moonlight/blackfun2.html |title=http://www.fmp666.com/moonlight/blackfun2.html |work=fmp666.com |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arkhon Infaustus]].&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt; Some liken Nazism to Christianity in that it is [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]], [[Collectivism|collectivist]], and a &quot;[[herd mentality]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=dissection/&gt;&lt;ref name=tormentor/&gt; Olson writes that the shunning of Nazism within the scene &quot;has nothing to do with notions of a 'universal humanity' or a rejection of hate&quot; but that Nazism is shunned &quot;because its hatred is too specific and exclusive&quot;.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=123}}

=== Unblack metal ===
{{Main|Unblack metal}}

Since the mid-1990s, there have been a few artists who have adopted the typical black metal sound and esthetic, but promote Christianity through their lyrics and imagery.&lt;ref name=kapelovitz&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kapelovitz |first=Dan |date=February 2001 |title=Heavy Metal Jesus Freaks - Headbanging for Christ |journal=Mean Magazine |url=http://www.kapelovitz.com/christianmetal.htm |accessdate=6 September 2007 |quote=And where secular black metal thrived, so did its Christian counterpart, unblack metal, with names like [[Satanicide]], Neversatan, and Satan's Doom. |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; These artists have been labelled 'Unblack metal'. The first Unblack metal record was ''[[Hellig Usvart]]'' (1994) by Australian artist [[Horde (band)|Horde]]. It was seen as a provocative parody of Norwegian black metal; it included song names such as &quot;Invert the Inverted Cross&quot; and the sole bandmember was credited as Anonymous (a pun on Euronymous). The album caused great controversy and death threats were issued against Horde. Anonymous was later revealed as [[Jayson Sherlock]]. Norwegian Christian band [[Antestor]] began releasing Unblack metal music in 1998. 

Many in the black metal scene see &quot;Christian black metal&quot; as an oxymoron.&lt;ref name=ultimatemetal/&gt; On the documentary ''[[Murder Music: A History of Black Metal]]'' (2007), all interviewed musicians stated, when asked about the matter, that black metal cannot be Christian.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; The term &quot;Christian black metal&quot; drew mocking replies from black metal musicians, for example [[Martin Walkyier]] of [[Sabbat (English band)|Sabbat]] commented: &quot;'Christian black metal?' What do they do? Do they build churches? Do they repair them? ''(laughs)''&quot;.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; In fact, the early unblack metal groups Horde and Antestor refused to call their music &quot;black metal&quot; because they did not share its ethos.
