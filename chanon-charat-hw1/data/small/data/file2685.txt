{{nihongo|'''Baku'''|獏{{lang|en| or }}貘}} are Japanese supernatural beings that devour dreams and nightmares. They have a long history in Japanese folklore and art, and more recently have appeared in Japanese [[anime]] and [[manga]] (see examples cited below).

The Japanese term ''baku'' has two current meanings, referring to both the traditional dream-devouring creature and to the zoological [[tapir]] (e.g., the [[Malayan tapir|Malayan Tapir]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;nakagawa&quot;&gt;Nakagawa Masako 1999 &quot;Sankai ibutsu: An early seventeenth-century Japanese illustrated manuscript&quot;. ''Sino-Japanese Studies'', 11:24-38. Pages 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, there have been changes in how the baku is depicted.

==History and description==
The traditional Japanese nightmare-devouring baku originates in [[Chinese folklore]] and was familiar in Japan as early as the [[Muromachi]] period (14th-15th century).&lt;ref&gt;Hori Tadao 2005 &quot;Cultural note on dreaming and dream study in the future: Release from nightmare and development of dream control technique,&quot; ''Sleep and Biological Rhythms'' 3 (2), 49–55.&lt;/ref&gt; Hori Tadao has described the dream-eating abilities attributed to the traditional baku and relates them to other preventatives against nightmare such as [[amulet]]s. [[Kaii-Yōkai Denshō Database]], citing a 1957 paper, and Mizuki also describe the dream-devouring capacities of the traditional baku.&lt;ref&gt;Mizuki, Shigeru 2004 ''Mujara 5: Tōhoku, Kyūshū-hen'' (in Japanese). Japan: Soft Garage. page 137. ISBN 4-86133-027-0.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early 17th-century Japanese manuscript, the ''Sankai Ibutsu'' ({{nihongo2|山海異物}}), describes the baku as a shy, Chinese mythical [[Chimera (mythology)|chimera]] with an [[elephant]]’s trunk, [[rhinoceros]] eyes, an [[ox]] tail, and [[tiger]] paws, which protected against pestilence and evil, although eating nightmares was not included among its abilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;nakagawa&quot;/&gt; However, in a 1791 Japanese wood-block illustration, a specifically dream-destroying baku is depicted with an elephant’s head, tusks, and trunk, with horns and tiger’s claws.&lt;ref&gt;Kern, Adam L. 2007 ''Manga from the Floating World: Comicbook culture and the kibyoshi of Edo Japan''. Cambridge: Harvard University Asian Center. Page 236, figure 4.26.&lt;/ref&gt; The elephant’s head, trunk, and tusks are characteristic of baku portrayed in classical era (pre-[[Meiji period|Meiji]]) Japanese wood-block prints (see illustration) and in shrine, temple, and [[netsuke]] carvings.&lt;ref&gt;{{nihongo2|[http://www.sirasaki.co.jp/baku/baku.html 夢貘まくら]}}.

Macmillan. Pages 245-248. ISBN 4-86133-027-0.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern representations ==
Since the 1980s, the baku appears not as a chimera of an elephant and tiger but as a zoologically recognizable tapir. Examples include:

* [[Oshii Mamoru]]’s 1984 animated film ''[[Urusei Yatsura 2: Beautiful Dreamer|Beautiful Dreamer]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Oshii Mamoru 1984 ''Beautiful Dreamer.'' New York: US Manga Corp. ASIN: B0001Y4MRW.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruh, Brian 2004 ''Stray Dog of Anime: The Films of Mamoru Oshii.'' New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on an episode of [[Rumiko Takahashi]]'s manga ''[[Urusei Yatsura]]'' (1978–1987) that depicts the baku as a tapir.&lt;ref&gt;Takahashi Rumiko 1995 ''Waking to a nightmare.'' In: ''The Return of Lum: Urusei Yatsura''. San Francisco: Viz. Pp. 141–156.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Tapir-type baku appear in [[Pokémon]] in the character [[Drowzee]]/ [[Hypno]] and Munna/ Musharna&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/#96&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Digimon]] franchise features a character called Bakumon (also called Tapirmon).&lt;ref&gt;[http://digimon.net/cat-digimon-dictionary/06-ha/bakumon/index.html ''Digimon Dictionary'': Bakumon]&lt;/ref&gt;

* They also appear in [[Haruhiko Mikimoto]]'s manga ''[[Marionette Generation]]'' (2001, original 1990).&lt;ref&gt;Mikimoto Haruhiko 2001 (original 1990). ''A Profile of the Heart''. In: ''Marionette Generation, Volume 1'', San Francisco: Viz Communications. Pages 159-178.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dream-eating, tapir-shaped baku have also entered non-Japanese popular culture:

* The picture book &quot;The Dream Eater&quot; by Christian Garrison tells the story of a young boy, Yukio, who meets a baku and brings it to his village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Dream Eater |last=Garrison |first=Christian |year=1978 |publisher=Bradbury Press |location=Scarsdale, NY |isbn=0-87888-134-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
