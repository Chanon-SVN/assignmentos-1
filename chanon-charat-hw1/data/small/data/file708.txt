'''Agni''' ({{lang-sa|अग्नि}} ''Agni''), is a [[Rigvedic deities|Hindu deity]], one of the most important of the [[Vedic civilization|Vedic]] gods. He is the god of fire&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Cavendish (occult writer)|Cavendish, Richard]] (1998). ''Mythology, An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Principal Myths and Religions of the World''. ISBN 1-84056-070-3&lt;/ref&gt; and the acceptor of sacrifices for onwards conveyance to other deities. The sacrifices made to Agni go to the [[deity|deities]] because Agni is a messenger&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=January 19, 2013 |url=http://rigvedaanalysis.wordpress.com/2013/01/19/agni-the-messenger-god/ |title=Agni - The Messenger God |publisher=Rigvedaanalysis.wordpress.com |date=2013-01-19 |accessdate=2013-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; from and to the other gods. He is ever-young, because the fire is re-lit every day, and is immortal.

==Overview==

Agni occupies a prominent place in the [[Vedas]] and [[Brahmanas]] works. The ancient Indians recognized it as the power of heat and light and the will-power united with wisdom, they knew the human will-power to be a feeble projection of this power which they believed could be strengthened by the Rig Vedic chants to Agni.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Agni in Rig Veda|author=R.L.Kashyap|publisher=Sri Aurobindo Kapali Sastry Institute of Vedic Culture|page=14|url= http://www.amazon.in/Agni-Rig-Veda-Mantras-spiritual/dp/817994042X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vedic|Vedic people]] developed the worship of Agni, personified and deified Agni as the sacrificial fire, as the priest of the gods and as the god of the priests, who through [[yajna]] carries the oblations to the gods, the celestial controllers of the mysterious and potent forces of nature, to ensure the continuance of conditions favourable to mankind. In Vedic deities, Agni occupies, after Indra, the most important position. In the [[Rig Veda]] there are over 200 hymns addressed to and in praise of Agni. Agni is the [[Rishi]] (hymn-seer) of [[Sukta]] X.124 of the Rig Veda, and along with [[Indra]] and [[Surya]] makes up the Vedic triad of deities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World Vol.1|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|page=210|url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=w9pmo51lRnYC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=Agni&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RFw_VMfgHdOgugSL0oCYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Agni&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agni, the Vedic god of fire, is depicted as having two heads, one head marks immortality and the other marks an unknown symbol of life. Agni has made the transition into the Hindu pantheon of gods, without losing his importance. With [[Varuna]] and [[Indra]] he is one of the supreme gods in the Rig Veda. Due to the link between heaven and earth, and between deities and humans, he is associated with Vedic sacrifice, taking offerings to the other world in his fire. In [[Hinduism]], his vehicle is the ram.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Bowker (theologian)|Bowker, John]] (1997). ''World Religions''. New York: DK Publishing, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The word ''agni'' is [[Sanskrit]] for &quot;fire&quot; (noun), cognate with [[Latin]] ''ignis'' (the root of English ''ignite''), Russian огонь (''ogon''), Polish &quot;ogień&quot;, Slovenian &quot;ogenj&quot;, Serbo-Croatian ''oganj'', and Lithuanian ''ugnis''—all with the meaning &quot;fire&quot;, with the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European root being ''h₁égni-''. Agni has three forms: fire, lightning and the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduwebsite.com/hinduism/concepts/agni.asp |title=Agni, the Vedic God of Fire |publisher=Hinduwebsite.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants of Agni==

In Hindu scriptures, Agni is the God of Fire, and is present in many phases of life such as honouring of a birth (diva lamp), prayers (diva lamp), at weddings (the yajna where the bride and groom circle the fire seven times) and at death (cremation).

In Section VII of the [[Sabha Parva]] of [[Mahabharata]], [[Narada]] speaks about the twenty-seven fires conveying the sacrificial butter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mahabharata Book 2 Sabha Parva|publisher=Netlancers Inc.|url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=tznrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT21&amp;lpg=PT21&amp;dq=twenty+seven+agnis+sabha+parva+mahabharata&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=37WW4mFsb0&amp;sig=HT9AURNPkCJK8PzoDs6ZOE-kXdg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=i59-VNeLH5CLuATzrICICA&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=twenty%20seven%20agnis%20sabha%20parva%20mahabharata&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; which fires are:-

Agni is also the name of one of the ''[[Saptarishi]]'' of the ''Svarocisa Manvantara'', one of the ''[[Saptarishi]]'' of the ''Tamasa Manvantara'' and one of the ''[[Saptarishi]]'' of the ''Indrasavarni Manvantara'' which is yet to come. Agni is the name of the son of ''Dharma'' and ''Vasordhara'', of an ''Achārya'' and of a disciple of Indra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World Vol.1|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|page=214|url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=w9pmo51lRnYC&amp;pg=PA213&amp;dq=Agni&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RFw_VMfgHdOgugSL0oCYBA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Agni&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vedic conception of Agni==
{{Classic element}}

Agni is the first word of the first hymn of the [[Rig Veda]] (Sukta I.i.1) revealed to Rishi Madhuchchandah Vaishvamitah in Gāyatri metre, which reads:

:अग्नि॒म् ई॑ळे पुरो॒हि॑तं यज्ञ॒स्य॑ देव॒म् ऋत्वि॒ज॑म् । 
:होता॑रं रत्नधा॒त॑मम् ॥

With this mantra the Rig Veda begins with a prayer to Agni, the receiver, holder and distributor of energy, who leads the ''devtas'' to victory in their battles against the ''asuras'', and confers wealth of various kinds to the performers of ''yajnas''. The first line of the first mantra of the first ''sukta'' of the first ''mandala'' of the Rig Veda consists of six words. The first word is ''agnimeeley'', which is a compound word. This word is made of two words ''agni'' (energy) and ''eeley'' (initiate or pray). The Vedic mantras were the direct perceptions of the seers - ऋचः ऋषीणां दृष्टयो भवन्ति ||. The purport of the afore-cited important mantra ([[Rig Veda]] I.i.1) is:

: &quot;I aspire intensely for Agni, the adorable, the leader who carries out the ''yajna''; who does and gets done the ''yajna'' in due season, who is the summoning priest capable of bringing the gods to the ''yajna'' performed here, and the one who establishes excellent felicities in the aspirants. &quot;

Agni is the 'Mystic Fire', adored by the ancient and the present seers, to whom obeisance is carried by thought, and who endowing inner plenitude to the performers of ''yajnas'', leads the ''yajna'' and through seer-will, and as the summoning priest takes them forward on the journey leading to God who is Truth. Agni is the envoy, the carrier of offerings, who born in the human aspirant, awakens the gods, burns the opposing foes - the demons. Agni, the youthful lord of the house who has the flame-tongue for his mouth, is invoked (kindled) by Agni –

:अग्निनाग्निः समिध्यते कविर्गृहपतिर्युवा | 
:हव्यवाड्जुह्वास्यः ||

who is the destroyer of afflictions, the purifier possessing the power that fills and fulfils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Agni in Rig Veda|author=R.L.Kashyap|publisher=Sri Aurobindo Kapali Sastry Institute of Vedic Culture|pages=17–35|url= http://www.amazon.in/Agni-Rig-Veda-Mantras-spiritual/dp/817994042X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agni is the supreme director of religious ceremonies and duties, and figures as messenger between mortals and gods. Vedic rituals all involve Agni, for example, the elaborate '' [[Agnicayana]] '', which is the piling of the fire-altar, and the '' [[Agnihotra]] '', which is making offerings to Agni. The Rig Veda often says that Agni arises from water or dwells in the waters; the Vedic sage says that Agni manifesting in the waters and seated in the lap of the winding waters, flaming upward, increases; and that Agni was born by the prowess of [[Tvastar|Tvashtr]] ([[Rig Veda]] I.95.5). He may have originally been the same as [[Apam Napat]], the supreme god of creation, who is also sometimes described as fire arising from water. Hydrogen burns easily and Oxygen is required to inflame the fire. This is the important physiological phenomenon in any living body, which in a natural explanation may have referred to flames from natural gas or oil seepages surfacing through water, or as the seven rays or bands of light of a rainbow. Other Rig-vedic names, epithets or aspects of Agni include [[Matarishvan]], [[Jataveda]]s, or Bharata.

Agni is a '' [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]] '', second only to [[Indra]] in the power and importance attributed to him in [[Vedic mythology]], with 218 out of 1,028 hymns of the [[Rigveda]] dedicated to him. He is [[Indra]]'s twin, and therefore a son of [[Dyaus Pita]] and [[Prthivi]]. However, he is also said to have two mothers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|publisher=GBD Books|place=New Delhi|page=197|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dXZJXwAACAAJ&amp;dq=the+illumination+of+knowledge&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YqHaUL6IM8byrQe71IGgDQ&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ|quote=Rig Veda I.31.2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or has two parts of the [[Making fire|firedrill]] used to start the fire, and ten servant maids (the fingers of the man who is lighting the fire) or as the twice-born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|publisher=GBD Books|place=New Delhi|page=43|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dXZJXwAACAAJ&amp;dq=the+illumination+of+knowledge&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YqHaUL6IM8byrQe71IGgDQ&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ|quote=Rig Veda 1.149.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of the [[Guardians of the directions]], representing the southeast. Rishi Medhatithi Kanva of the Rig Veda (I.xiii.3) calls Agni - मधुजिव्हम meaning the sweet-tongued. In the [[Mundaka Upanishad]] (I.ii.1-5) it is said that Agni, here meant the ''Āhavaniya''  Fire, has seven tongues or flames – ''Kālī'' ('black'), ''Karālī'' ('terrible'), ''Manojava'' ('speedy as the mind'), ''Sulohita'' ('very red'), ''Sudhumravarna'' ('coloured like thick smoke'), ''Sphulingini'' ('emitting sparks') and ''Vishwaruchi'' ('having the fuel as the Sun' – तस्मादग्निः समिधो यस्य सूर्यः (II.i.5)). Agni, who is addressed as ''Atithi'' ('guest'), is also called – जातवेदसम् meaning - the one who knows all things that are born, created or produced ([[Rig Veda]] I.xliv.4), thus Rishi Praskanva states that Agni represents great learning and enlightening wisdom which ought to be sought, located and humbly approached. Agni excites ''[[Buddhi]]'' (reason and intellect), the perceiving and the determining factor, and by illuminating the mind it makes one understand and comprehend the truth – प्रचेतसोऽग्ने देवाँ इह द्रवत् ([[Rig Veda]] I.xliv.7). The Rishis of the Rig Veda knew knowledge to be the quality of the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]], which quality inheres in the Atman and is in the nature of manifestations as physical and mental objects that exist in Time and Space. Therefore, by invoking Agni, the self-sustaining child who generates his mothers (two mothers) by his own powers - वत्सो मातृर्जन्यत स्वाधाभि ([[Rig Veda]] I.95.4), and as the guardian of all existence (सतः च गोपाम्) is also invoked the Unseeable One and His invisible power of infinite strength and magnitude which supports, sustains and protects space and all things, including Fire and Time, contained in Space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|publisher=GBD Books|place=New Delhi|pages=40–44, 31|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dXZJXwAACAAJ&amp;dq=the+illumination+of+knowledge&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YqHaUL6IM8byrQe71IGgDQ&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rishi Praskanvah Kanvah states - अग्ने पूर्वा अनूषसो विभावसो दीदेथ ([[Rig Veda]] I.44.10) – that Agni which is rich in lustre has blazed after many proceeding dawns; here, dawn refers to the vision of truth and to the spiritual experience which has a natural end. Rishi Nodha Gautama prays – प्रातर्मक्षू धियावसुर्जगम्यात् ([[Rig Veda]] I.60.5) – for Agni, rich in thought, to come soon at dawn; here, dawn refers to actual sunrise and also to spiritual experience or awakening. Agni is also called the lover of dawn:-

:शुक्रः शुषुकाँ उषो न जारः पप्रा समीची दिवो न ज्योतिः | - ([[Rig Veda]] I.69.1)

and asked to fill the two (Heaven and Earth) with light (of knowledge) like the Sun. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Agni in Rig Veda|author=R.L.Kashyap|publisher=Sri Aurobindo Kapali Sastry Institute of Vedic Culture|pages=72, 89, 104|url=  http://www.amazon.in/Agni-Rig-Veda-Mantras-spiritual/dp/817994042X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agni, Vayu and Soma==

In the [[Vedas]], Agni, Vayu and Soma or 'fire' (light and heat), 'air' (energy and action) and 'water', which are three of the five ''[[tanmatras]]'' born from the three heated worlds, are the principal deities; agni brings the subject and the object together and establishes a relation between the two (''sambandha''); vayu causes that relation to evolve (''abhidheya''), and whose activity soma directs converting forms into pleasure that consciousness enjoys (''prayojna''). These three ''[[shakti]]s'' are involved in all material and spiritual vedic rituals. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Creationism|author=Ashish Dalela|publisher=iUniverse|page=312|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=qLe-aZfl7YEC&amp;pg=PA312&amp;dq=agni+vayu&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2ACyVPDVBsaPuATtqoLICw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=agni%20vayu&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Agni, Vayu and Jala are three of the three-fold eight fundamental qualities of intelligence i.e. eight in terms of the value of consciousness, eight in terms of the devata quality of consciousness and eight in terms of the chhandas quality of consciousness. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mirror of Consciousness|author=Anna J. Bonshek|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=135|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=sT13ws7RKgYC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=agni+jala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2wOyVKfqIIu6uAT62YKwBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=agni%20jala&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rishi Nodha Gautama informs us - प्रशस्तं रातिं भरद् भृगवे मातरिश्वा ([[Rig Veda]] I.60.1) that agni was brought by [[Mātariśvan|Mātarishvan]] to [[Bhrigu]] as a gift; matarishvan refers to the one who breathes life in the mid-world (life-breath or ''[[prāṇa|prāna]]'' or ''[[Vayu|vāyu]]''), ''mātari'' is an epithet for God [[Vayu]]. And elsewhere, Rishi Hiranyastupah Angirasa prays - तवमग्ने प्रथमो मातरिश्वन ([[Rig Veda]] I.31.3) &quot; You Agni are important for Vāyu &quot; simply because for the manifestation of agni, and it is also necessary for vayu, the pervading life-force, to stir agni which is (latent in human beings) into action in all the spheres – मथीद् यदीं विभृतो मातरिश्वा ([[Rig Veda]] I.71.4). Matarishvan refers to agni (''tejas'') and vayu (''prana''), both ([[Nirukta]] VII.26). Agni is described as dwelling in waters (''apah'') which cleanse moral guilt, sins of violence, cursing and lying, and purify the worshippers. [[Apam Napat]] is besought to give waters rich in honey for increased strength. Agni is also described to have its origin in aerial waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Mythology|author=Arthur Anthony Macdonell|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=71,85,92|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=b7Meabtj8mcC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;lpg=PA71&amp;dq=matarisvan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=m3gfqBdrj2&amp;sig=NZFKUHSahD8swqsGPdUSEkkGQOs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QxSyVN7FGIyYuQT6j4DQDQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=matarisvan&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A [[Yajurveda]] [[mantra]] -

:देवस्य त्वा सवितुः प्रसवेऽश्विनोर्वाहुभ्यां पूष्णो हस्ताभ्याम् |
:अग्नये जुष्टं गृहणाम्यग्नीषोमाभ्यां जुष्टं  गृहणामि || ([[Yajurveda]] I.10) 

refers to ''Agni-Jala vidya'' essential to the mastering of the ''Agni vidya'', for water is used to purify the ''[[yajna]]'' and also all those involved in the performance of the ''yajna''; water in its own turn is purified by the wind (''vayu'') which lifts the yajna-fumes upwards from the ''yajna'' which then induces rain and thus ensuring prosperity and righteous growth, enhances wisdom. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yajurveda|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books|page=12|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=1h-Go8i3iPcC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=agni+jala&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2wOyVKfqIIu6uAT62YKwBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=agni%20jala&amp;f=false  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agni, which consumes all oblations offered to it, is also called ''Arka'' which is 'Water', the accessory to worship and the cause of fire that covers all food which covers all life for life feeds on life ([[Yajurveda]] V.vii.5). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ten Upanishads of Four Vedas|author=Ram K.

==Nature and significance of Agni==

[[Atharvan]], the first teacher of divine wisdom (''Brahma-vidya''), was the eldest son of [[Brahma]]; as a priest he first instituted worship of 'fire' (''Agni'') and 'nectar' (''Soma'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy|author=John A.Grimes|publisher=SUNY Press|page=66|url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=qcoUFYOX0bEC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=agni++brahma+sutras&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=co6BVOYB0Iu4BLW5gbAC&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=agni%20%20brahma%20sutras&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Agni Purana]], which is the eighth in the list of eighteen [[Puranas]], no god is approachable without the medium of Agni, and no divinity is without the presence of Agni; his element is earth. At the command of [[Bhrigu]], Agni was brought down from the heavens for man’s use by [[Matarishvan]], in the later writings Agni is described as a son of [[Angiras (sage)|Angiras]] who happened to discover fire and its uses. Agni as the immortal guest is the witness of all actions, supremely powerful, all consuming and unresistible but who commands all earthly and heavenly riches i.e. all temporal good. His most destructive aspect is when he acts as ''Kravyad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Agni Purana|author=B.K.Chaturvedi|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books|pages=11, 9, 12|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=pTT72k9avd0C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=agni&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wG9AVK0swpe4BO6pgLgE&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=agni&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agni first appeared in the heavens in the form of lightening; this was his first birth, his second birth was among the human beings as ''Jātaveda'' (learned by birth); his third birth was in water ([[Rig Veda]] I.45.1).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Who is Agni: Prophet or Parameshwar|publisher=Q.S.Khan’s Books|page=14|url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=pTT72k9avd0C&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=agni++brahma+sutras&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=noOBVKeoGZDHuASX84DgDg&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=agni%20%20brahma%20sutras&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Agni has two forms: ''Jataveda'' and ''Kravyada''.

:''Jātaveda'' is invoked to burn and carry the offerings (except flesh) to the respective Gods, in which case Agni is light identified with knowledge and with Brahman. 
:''Kravyād'' is invoked to burn the flesh (corpses and animal parts) in the Pitri-yajna for which purpose Agni is obtained from the rays of the Sun.
  
In the ''Jātaveda'' form, Agni, the god of fire, acts as the divine model for the sacrificial priest. He is the messenger who carries the oblation from humans to the gods, bringing the Gods to sacrifice, and interceding between gods and humans (Rig Veda I.26.3). When Agni is pleased, the gods are generous. Agni represents the cultivated, cooked and cultured aspects of Vedic ritual. Together with [[Soma]], Agni is invoked in the Rig Veda more than any other gods.&lt;ref&gt;Doniger, Wendy (2010). ''The Hindus: An Alternative History''. Oxford University Press. ISBN 978-0-19-959334-7 (Pbk)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rishis of the Rig Veda held Agni to be responsible for the manifestation of gods for the mortal being who then comes to know them and worship them by the mind -

:अग्निर्यद् वेर्मत्तार्य देवान्त्स चा बोधाति मनसा यजाति (Rig Veda I.77.2),

therefore, they pray to Agni to increase its own strength or power that is within all human beings for them to cultivate strong conviction and firm belief (''shraddha'') without which there cannot develop a meaningful faith and deep devotion to support a dedicated mind. Agni is the essence of the knowledge of Existence, with its increase is wholly destroyed ignorance and all delusions, there is no nescience to be taken for granted and the human form assumed by [[Brahman]] is erased from the mind. [[Śraddhā|Shraddha]] is that which supports and upholds Truth; it indicates a state of harmony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|publisher=GBD Books|place=New Delhi|pages=159, 195|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dXZJXwAACAAJ&amp;dq=the+illumination+of+knowledge&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YqHaUL6IM8byrQe71IGgDQ&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ|quote=Rig Veda 1.79.11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shatapatha Brahmana]] (SB 6.1.1.1) tells us that [[Prajapati]] was generated through the [[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]] of the [[rishis]] (equated with the non-existent of the Beginning), thereafter, through his own tapas Prajapati generated all the gods and all the creatures. He also generated Agni as the sacrificial fire and as the second self having wearied himself his glow and essence of him heated up and developed Agni (SB 10.6.5.2). Ritually Agni, as the altar built by the sacrifice, reconstitutes Prajapati.

==Depictions of Agni==
[[File:Agni and consort.jpg|thumb|Agni with his consort [[Svaha]].]]

In Hindu scriptures, Agni is depicted with two or seven hands, two heads and three legs. He has seven fiery tongues with which he licks the sacrificial butter. He rides a ram or a chariot harnessed by fiery horses. Agni is represented as red and two-faced, suggesting both his destructive and beneficent qualities, and with black eyes and hair, three legs and seven arms. He rides a ram, or a chariot pulled by goats or, more rarely, parrots. [[Seven rays]] of light emanate from his body. One of his names is ''Saptajihva'', &quot;the one having seven tongues&quot;.&lt;ref name=Jansen&gt;Jansen, Eva Rudy (1993). ''The Book of Hindu Imagery: Gods, Manifestations and Their Meaning''. p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Another one of his epithets is ''Abhimani'' (from Sanskrit: ''abhi'' (towards) + ''man'' (the verbal root man to think, reflect upon) meaning dignified, proud; longing for, thinking. Agni is worshipped as the symbol of piety and purity; as expression of two kinds of energy i.e. light and heat, he is the symbol of life and activity. When Agni is worshipped all gods (gods are symbols of life) lend their powers to this deity. The ancient seers had divided Agni into three parts – ''gārhapatya'' (for general domestic usage), ''āhavaniya'' (for inviting and welcoming a personage or deity) and ''dakshinagni'' (for fighting against all evil).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Agni Purana|author=B.K.Chaturvedi|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books|pages=18, 21|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=pTT72k9avd0C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=agni&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wG9AVK0swpe4BO6pgLgE&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=agni&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agni is the chief terrestrial deity personified by the sacrificial fire which is the centre of the ritual poetry of the Rig Veda. The earth enveloped in darkness and the sky, become visible when Agni is born; the acquisition of fire by man is regarded as a gift of the gods. Agni is only compared and not identified with the Sun. [[Yāska]] states that his predecessor Sākapuni regarded the threefold existence of Agni as being in earth, air and heaven as stated by the Rig Veda but a Brāhmana considered the third manifestation to be the Sun. Agni, who is more closely connected with human life than any other god, is often identified with other gods, especially with [[Varuna]] and [[Mitra (Vedic)|Mitra]], in the evening he becomes Varuna, when he rises in the morning he becomes Mitra. And, his priesthood is the most salient feature of his character. A sage of the Rig Veda (Sukta IV.iii.11) states that the Sun became visible when Agni was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vedic Mythology|author=Arthur Anthony Mcdonell|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=88–99|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=b7Meabtj8mcC&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=agni&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RtJAVNfiJ5SeugSag4HwCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=agni&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the collection at Bharat Kalā Kendra ([[Benares Hindu University]]), there is a First century CE, red sandstone sculpture identifiable as Agni shown in the garb of a Brahmin, very much like sage [[Kashyapa]], on the ''Govindanagar Rsyasrnga door-jamb''. In the [[Panchala]] coins of [[Agnimitra]] there is deity with a halo of flames and on [[Kushan Empire|Kushana]] coins there is engraved an Iranian deity under the name of Athos (Agni?); in [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] sculptures, Agni is shown as a Brahmanical deity with a halo of flames round the body and also with a beard, pot-bellied and holding ''amrtaghata'' (nectar-pot) in his right hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Early Stone Sculpture of Mathura|author=Sonya Rhie Quantanilla|publisher=BRILL|page=215|url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=X7Cb8IkZVSMC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=agni&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qNxAVLaRLcyjugSA-IDoCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=agni&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agnihotra yajna==

[[Agnihotra]] means - 'sacrificial fire'; the [[Agnihotri]]s once maintained a perpetual fire in their homes. This ritual ceremony was conducted on important and auspicious occasions; in many homes prayers are still offered to Agni (fire). The sage of the [[Atharvaveda]] (Sukta 19.55.3) prays to the fire for happiness and peace, for a happy temperament, resolve and good health, for strength and mental contentment, and as the ladder to spirituality. The sage also states – अग्नेर्होत्रेण प्रणुदे सपत्नान् - that ''Agnihotra'' destroys enemies ([[Atharvaveda]] 9.2.6). Even [[Gautama Buddha]] had explained the importance of the ''yajna of Agnihotra'' as &quot;the ocean amongst rivers, a king amongst people and Savitri amongst the verses&quot; ([[Sutta Nipata]] 568/21).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hindu Rites, Rituals, Customs and Traditions|author=Prem P.Bhalla|page=269|publisher=Pustak Mahal|url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=H31CPCsH-egC&amp;pg=PA269&amp;dq=agnihotra&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9tRBVIHsMpbnuQSQx4GgAw&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=agnihotra&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian people consider it as the duty of the man who has established his fires, as of the man who has no fires, to daily, morning and evening, to perform ''Agnihotra''. If the fires are kept perpetually alight, then they are required only to be brightened up for each occasion, if otherwise then it has to be taken from the ''garahpatya''. The main offering is milk, and at the end, the sacrificer offers four water oblations i.e. to the gods, to father and the fathers, to the seven seers and to Agni on earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Religion and the Philosophy of the Vedas and the Upanishads|author=A.B.Keith|page=318|url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=p9zCbRMQbyEC&amp;pg=PA318&amp;dq=agnihotra&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9tRBVIHsMpbnuQSQx4GgAw&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=agnihotra&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shatapatha Brahmana (SB 3.1.3.18) tells us that ''Agnihotra'' should be performed by the performer knowing that he will gain the strength and victories gained by Agni who conquered the earth, Vayu, the air and Surya, the sky, with whom he shares the world; and the same text further tells us that the ''Agnihotra'', doubtless, is the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Satapatha-brahmana|page=327|url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=aNE2AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA327&amp;dq=agnihotra&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zN5BVMekJ9DhuQSlnIKIBg&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=agnihotra&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] in his commentary on the [[Brahma Sutras]] states that the rightful observance of the Agnihotra and other rites are meant for those desirous of attaining Heaven and other enjoyments, and the understanding of the rightful doctrine of the Soul is meant for those desirous of emancipation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Brahma Sutras: With the commentary of Sankaracarya|page=45|url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=QdRDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=agni++brahma+sutras&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=noOBVKeoGZDHuASX84DgDg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=agni%20%20brahma%20sutras&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Upanishadic conception==

For the Vedic people Agni was the multifaceted psychological power connected with will, action and related powers, [[Isha Upanishad]] focuses on this tradition of Agni as the Divine Will which motivates and executes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Upanishads|author=Islam Katob|publisher=Islam Katob|pages=89, 48|url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=ONHwyglLcAMC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=Agni+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZetlVJTENYuVuASv9oH4Bw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Agni%20upanishads&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sage of this Upanishad, offering total submission and self-surrender of all the faculties of the lower egoistic human nature, prays to Agni, the Cosmic energy on account of which is the universe, and therefore, is the knower of all things that are manifested, to guide and lead him to its own place of origin, to That ([[Brahman]]) in which all this is established, to That from which all this has sprung, to That in which all this finally find refuge ([[Isha Upanishad]].18).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Works of Sri Aurobindo|publisher=Sri Aurobindo Ashram|page=10|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Kena Upanishad]], Agni reveals his identity as the heat energy and the ever-burning flame of the conscious force in matter that makes up the entire world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Upanishads = II – Kena and other Upanishads|author=Sri Aurobindo|publisher=Sri Aurobindo Ashram Publication|page=81|url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=Ksq7YUXIbKIC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=Agni+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZetlVJTENYuVuASv9oH4Bw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Agni%20upanishads&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gods sent first Agni to find out the nature of Brahman, which means it is Agni that releases the energy which is latent in all beings. Moreover, the sage of the Kena Upanishad refers to the functional differentiation and specialization of body parts on which account the life-stream progresses when he speaks of Agni becoming the speech and entering the mouth and [[Vayu]] becoming breath and entering the nostrils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Call of the Upanishads|author=Rohit Mehta|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=42|url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_aGXsz4C2z8C&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=Agni+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZetlVJTENYuVuASv9oH4Bw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Agni%20upanishads&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pravahana Jaivali]], who was well-versed in ''[[Samaveda|udgitha]]'', held that the Universe exhibits at every stage the principle of sacrifice in as much as the heaven by itself is a great altar in which the sun is burning as fuel from the oblation that is offered in this sacrifice, namely ''[[Śraddhā|shraddha]]'', rises the Moon; looking at the sky again it is seen that ''[[parjanya]]'' is the great altar in which the year is burning as fuel from the oblation offered in this sacrifice, namely the Moon, rises Rain; then again the whole world is a great altar in which the earth burns as fuel from the oblation offered in this sacrifice, namely Rain, rises Food; man himself is a great altar in which the opened mouth is the fuel from the oblation offered in his sacrifice, namely Food, rises Seed; and finally woman herself is a great altar in which Seed being offered as an oblation, rises Man. This is his celebrated &quot;Doctrine of the Five Fires&quot; - the ''Panchagni vidya''. Before [[Satyakama Jabala]], in bodily form arose the Three Sacrificial Fires to instruct him, the three fires were –  i) the ''Garhapatya'' who told him that the ultimate reality was to be found in the sun, ii) the ''Anvaharyapachana'' who told him that it was to be found in the moon, and iii) the ''Ahavaniya'' who told him that it was to be found in the lightening, but to whom Upakosala explained that the ultimate reality was to be found not in these three but in the image of the person reflected in the human eye. And from [[Katha Upanishad]] becomes known about [[Yama]] taught [[Nachiketa]] the secrets of the fire that leads to heaven and what bricks were required to build the altar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Constructive Survey of Upanishadic Philosophy|author=R.D.Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|pages=32, 183|url= https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chandogya Upanishad]] conceives the whole universal activity of creation as a kind of [[yajna]] (sacrifice) where everything is connected; this sacrifice/knowledge is known as the ''Panchagni vidya''. The activity of creation (or of manifestation of any object) begins with the birth of the child (or with the production of an atom or molecule) whom the cosmos produces and not parents alone, then the child’s presence is felt everywhere mainly because the universe is intimately inter-connected. The Shatras teach that the macrocosm is in the microcosm; each manifestation is the quintessence of every particle of ''[[Prakṛti|Prakrti]]'', and that ''Prakrti'' on its own accord takes care of each manifestation or birth and withdraws those manifestations as a part of the operation of the universal laws. This is the philosophical background of this ''vidya'' which deals all events of manifestation not merely as the birth of a human child alone, and which ''vidya'' is the contemplation of the mind in perceiving the reality that is transcendent to the visible parts of the inner sacrifice. The subtle effects (all effects are only phenomenal) produced by all our actions are invisible to the eye, they are called ''[[apurva]]''; we, as the causer of ''apurva'', reap the fruits of all our actions; because higher realms are activated by our actions, with every stage of development being a sacrifice i.e. a meditation, the consequence of those actions become the cause of our descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Gleanings from Rig Veda-When Science was Religion|author=Choudur Satyanarayana Moorty|author=Authorhouse|pages=107–115|url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=kv86C_pd5-YC&amp;pg=PA110&amp;dq=panchagni+vidya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0yJ8VN6EBtDiuQSU3oDQDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=panchagni%20vidya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chandogya Upanishad epitomizes 'Mind' and 'Ākāśa' into 'Speech', 'Prana', 'Sight' and 'Hearing' into 'Agni', 'Vayu', 'Aditya' and the 'Directions', and declares that Speech is a foot of Brahman; it shines with Agni as light. Dhira Satparaneya had told Mahasala Jabala that Agni is Speech ([[Shatapatha Brahmana]] X.ii.3).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=the Supreme Wisdom of the Upanishads|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=194, 312|url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=2jnPlEqwe_UC&amp;pg=PA312&amp;dq=agni++brahma+sutras&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=noOBVKeoGZDHuASX84DgDg&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=agni%20%20brahma%20sutras&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aditi and Agni==

In a [[sukta]] addressed to Agni, [[Vamadeva]] prays:

:चित्तिमचित्ति चिनवद्वि विदवान् पृष्ठेव वीता वृजना च मर्त्तान् |
:राये च नः स्वपत्याय देव दिति च रास्वादितिमुरुष्य || ([[Rig Veda]] IV.ii.11)

in which mantra he calls Agni as ''[[Diti]]'' (दिति) which word is to be read as Aditi, the all devouring [[Death]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Essays on Indo-Aryan Mythology|author=Aiyangar Narayan|publisher=Asian Edu.Services|page=296|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Oym17qIeB-0C&amp;pg=PA296&amp;lpg=PA296&amp;dq=aditi+rig+veda+death&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=h-jDZ5RmCh&amp;sig=WJdD4OuCAr74wyLQgN_pQRLDwnk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cJGuVM2KL4fIuATzuoHYBg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=aditi%20rig%20veda%20death&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; same as is stated in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] (I.ii.5) –

[[Aditi]] is an ancient Rig Vedic deity; she is the divine mother of all [[Vedic]] [[god]]s and therefore, is the source of all things. Her womb, protected by [[Vishnu]], is the navel of [[prithvi]]. Aditi means boundlessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Images of Indian Goddesses|author=Madhu Bazaz Wangu|publisher=Abhinav Publications|page=33|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=k8y-vKtqCmIC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=aditi+rig+veda+death&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d9YgxMmOQL&amp;sig=yVqylvf9kOsWv3Hl5TQK4G6U4Vo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ipKuVKj1HM-SuAT3loLoBw&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=aditi%20rig%20veda%20death&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Upanishads]] tell us that the deity is Death who first created the mind and from it all else. Death is Aditi because everything becomes the food for Death, and Aditi, the eternal eater, is everything. Agni is Death and Death is hunger, because of hunger there is birth, growth, decay and death. The mouth is the abode of the deity of Fire, and it is also the organ of speech because of which everything has a name given to it, names signify things. At the time of dissolution all created things re-enter the mouth, lose all names and forms and merge with that single source called Hunger or Death which after eating all creation sleeps the dreamless sleep of the undifferentiated universal consciousness as though unaware of itself, then there is deathly silence everywhere because there is no one to cause sound and no one to hear. Agni is the presiding deity of Speech; both have a limited role to play; Speech has to be sacrificed for gaining the intuitive experience of the Atman, and Rishi [[Kashyapa]] ([[Rig Veda]] IX.64.25) informs that though Paramatman prefers speech rich in knowledge and thought it is the silent speech of the mind in deep contemplation which is preferred. The renouncer renounces the fires which had engaged him (that led him to the different spheres) to the [[Vaishvanara|Vaishvanara-fire]] and also consigns the sacred [[Gayatri Mantra]] to the fire that is in his speech. And, even though one gathers wisdom when one listens to others who speak, and the enlightened performers of the yajna work towards gaining of the heavenly speech, it is only when Speech has stopped functioning that the Atman serves as the light of man ([[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] IV.iii.6).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Illumination of Knowledge|publisher=GBD Books|place=New Delhi|page=142,177, 168|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=dXZJXwAACAAJ&amp;dq=the+illumination+of+knowledge&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YqHaUL6IM8byrQe71IGgDQ&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwCQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to the departure of organs [[Badarayana]] states:-

:अग्न्यादिगतिश्रुतेरिति चेन्न भाक्तत्वात् | ([[Brahma Sutras]](III.1.4)

:&quot;If it be objected(that the organs do not accompany the soul at the time of death) since the Upanishadic texts mention their entry into (the deities) Fire and others, then we say, not so, for that is said in a secondary sense.&quot;

[[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] in his ''Bhāśya'' on this sutra explains that the merger of the organ of speech into Fire, of the organ of smell in Air etc.([[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] III.ii.13), is said in a figurative manner for &quot; it is not possible to conceive of any going for the soul if it be denied that the organs follow it as its conditioning factors; nor can the soul have any experience in the next body in the absence of the organs.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Brahma Sutras: With the commentary of Sankaracarya|page=536|url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=QdRDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=agni++brahma+sutras&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=noOBVKeoGZDHuASX84DgDg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=agni%20%20brahma%20sutras&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agni is the eldest son of [[Brahma]]. In [[Visnu Purana]], Agni (''Abhimani'') the fire god is said to have sprung from the mouth of the [[Purusha|Virat purusha]], the Cosmic Man. His wife is [[Svaha]]. ''Abhimani'' had three sons of surpassing brilliancy: ''Pavaka'', ''Pavamana'', and ''Suchi'', the personifications of the three fires that produced our earth and humanity (VP 1:10).&lt;ref&gt;Dowson, John (1961).

[[Agneya]] is the Hindu Goddess of Fire and the daughter of Agni.

Agni’s three sons, according to the [[Vayu Purana]], stand for three different aspects of Agni (fire): ''Pavaka'' is the electric fire, ''Pavamana'' is the fire produced by friction, and ''Suchi'' is the solar fire. Interpreted on the cosmic and human planes, these three fires are &quot;Spirit, Soul, and Body, the three great Root groups, with their four additional divisions&quot; (SD 2:247). They are said to have been cursed by the sage [[Vasishtha]] to be born again and again (cf BP 4:24,4; SD 2:247–8). &quot;Every fire has a distinct function and meaning in the worlds of the physical and the spiritual. He has, moreover, in its essential nature a corresponding relation to one of the human psychic faculties, besides its well determined chemical and physical potencies when coming in contact with the terrestrially differentiated matter&quot; (SD 1:521).

In some Hindu symbolism, Agni's parents are said to be the two components of the [[Making fire#Hand drill|firedrill]] used to start the fire, and when young he was said to be cared for by ten servants who are represented by the ten fingers of the man who starts the fire.

''Agniparikshā'' or 'the Fire ordeal' has Agni as the witness. [[Sita]] was forced to undergo this ordeal to prove her virtue. Agni redeemed the original Sita from the wrath and condemnation of her husband and her community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Erotic Justice: Law and the New Politics of Postcolonialism|author=Ratna Kapur|publisher=Routledge|pages=51,200|url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=_eaNAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA200&amp;dq=Agnipariksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QPJiVOkGhLa4BOjfgtgJ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Agnipariksha&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ayurvedic conception==

[[Agni (Ayurveda)|Agni]] is an important entity in [[Ayurveda]]. Agni is the fiery metabolic energy of digestion, allows assimilation of food while ridding the body of waste and toxins and transforms dense physical matter into subtle forms of energy the body needs. ''Jathar-agni'' determines the production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach, ''Bhuta-agni'' determines the production of bile in the liver, ''Kloma-agni'' determines the production of sugar-digesting pancreatic enzymes and so forth. The nature and quality of these ''agnis'' depend on one’s ''dosha'' which can be – ''vata'', ''pitta'' or ''kapha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yoga Journal Sep-Oct 2003|publisher=Active Interest Media|page=38|url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=u-kDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=agni&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wG9AVK0swpe4BO6pgLgE&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=agni&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agni is also known as ''Vaisvanara''. In Shrimad [[Bhagavad Gita]] (Sloka 15.14) it is said:

:अहं वैश्वानरो भूत्वा प्राणिनां देहमाश्रितः |
:प्राणापानसमायुक्तः पचाम्यन्नं चतुर्विधम् ||

:&quot;Taking the form of fire lodged in the body of all creatures and united with the Prāna (exhalation) and Apāna (inhalation) breaths, it is I who consume the four kinds of food.&quot;

Here, the digestion of the food is referred to as [[Vaisvanara]]. The four kinds of food are – a) ''Bhaksya'', solid food that requires mastication before swallowing, b) ''Bhojya'', food that can be directly swallowed without mastication, c) ''Lehya'', food that can be licked and d) ''Cosya'', that which is sucked. Just as the illuminating power in the fire is a part of Lord’s own effulgence even so the heating power in it i.e. its digestive and appetizing power is also a part of His energy or potency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Srimadbhagavadagita Tattvavivecani|author=Jayadayal Goyandka|publisher=Gita Press|page=613|url= http://www.vedicbooks.net/srimad-bhagavad-gita-tattva-vivechani-hindi-p-16541.html|quote=Verses BG 15.14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water is needed in all physiological reaction; water is either produced or consumed in form of Hydrogen combining with Oxygen.  [[Pandurang Shastri Athavale]] of [[Swadhyaya Parivar]] has narrated this beautifully in his discourses of [[Ishopanishad]]. The Vedic people attributed special healing power to 'water' or to 'fire'; the ''Kauśika Sūtra'', which constitutes the oldest system of Indian Medical Science, relies on the so-called Vedic magical chants which chants or songs actually give with great clarity the symptoms of the various diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Indian Literature Vol. 1|author=Moriz Winternitz|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=119|url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=JRfuJFRV_O8C&amp;pg=PA80&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=fire+song+song+of+agni&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TMovSkOV8E&amp;sig=SKNHe0YeoG3dps920WrG6K0jKWc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cgpjVO6jK82OuASEqID4BQ&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=fire%20song%20song%20of%20agni&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agni and the Arya Samaj==

[[Arya Samaj]] was founded by Swami [[Dayananda Saraswati]] on 10 April 1875, at Bombay.

The Arya Samajists, who call heaven and hell as the conditions of the soul, do not worship the fire, but perform ''yajnas'' to recite [[Vedas|Vedic mantras]] and that too mostly on special occasions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Arya Samaj and Indian Civilization|author=R.K.Pruthi|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|pages=58, 55|url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=8zrxlH1Tl24C&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=arya+samaj&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lztQVJO6McT88QXQqID4Bw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=arya%20samaj&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; even though Agni is of central importance in their religious practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Picturing God|publisher=Bloomsbury|page=76|url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=VfY8SMIxFhoC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=agni+and+arya+samaj&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JENQVOrbFIT48AWZ9oG4DQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=agni%20and%20arya%20samaj&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the performance of those ''yajnas'', and as part of ''Samidadhana'' ('fuel-adding'), fire is placed in the ''vedi'' with a prayer for the ''yajmana'' (the performer of the yajna) to accomplish the desired performances, then that fire placed in the ''vedi'' lights up the woodfuel (''samidha'') which is the power of endurance to fire which is present in all created things, which fire is kept enkindled by ghee and to which to begin with oblations are offered meant for ''jatavedas agni'' and the ''angiras agni'' alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sanskar Vidhi|publisher=Diamond Pocket Books|page=39|url= http://books.google.co.in/books?id=5ihgY8MVpV0C&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=agni+and+arya+samaj&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JENQVOrbFIT48AWZ9oG4DQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=agni%20and%20arya%20samaj&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fire-rites in other religions==

In Newar, Tibetan and Japanese [[Buddhism]], he is a [[Guardians of the directions#Lokapālas|lokapāla]] guarding the Southeast. In the Tibetan text ''Jigten lugs kyi bstan bcos'' it says &quot;Make your hearth in the southeast corner of the house, which is the quarter of Agni&quot;. He also plays a central role in most Buddhist ''homa'' fire-[[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] rites. A typical praise to Agni starts  &quot;Son of Brahma, Lord of the World, King of fire gods empowered by Takki, Whose supreme wisdom burns all delusion [...]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Perrott, Michael; Tuluku, Sharpa (1987). ''A Manual of Ritual Fire Offerings''. Library of Tibetan Works and Archives. ISBN 81-85102-66-X p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mikkyō]] tradition Agni is known as ''Katen'' (火天). In the [[Philippine Mythology]], Agni is also the god of fire as their local beliefs in pre-Spanish times have some [[Hindu]] influences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slideshare.net/br0fferBzee/philippinehistory-precolonialperiod]&lt;/ref&gt;

All faiths have fire rites. The [[eternal flame]] was a component of the Jewish religious rituals performed in the [[Tabernacle]] and later in the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], where a commandment required a fire to burn continuously upon the Outer [[Altar (Bible)|Altar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Book of Leviticus |url= http://bible.cc/leviticus/6-12.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hebrews]] offered their children to Agni as [[Angels in Judaism|Maloch]]. The serpent is also an emblem of Agni. [[Zorastrianism|Mazdeans]] in Persia worshipped fire as god, that [[Angra Mainyu|Ahirman]] commanded fire. [[Parsi|Parsees]] still see him in their ''Atash-ga''. Fire is one of man’s earliest divine ideas; ''Ag'' is a [[Turan]]ian root; it impregnated earth, for [[Orpheus|Orphean]] mystics said – &quot;without heat nothing germinates&quot;; and the Japanese kosmogonies teach that from fire and water sprang mountains and rivers. The [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] fire symbol represents the fire stick. The [[Celts]] and the [[Greeks]] walked round the fire holding grass ([[Desmostachya bipinnata|kusha]]) in their hands, and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] spoke of fire as the focus of the hearth and of family life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Religions|author=John G.R.Forlong|publisher=Cosimo|pages=32–34|url=  http://books.google.co.in/books?id=O_OviUJRzJAC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=agni&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JFBCVOW4GceSuQSa74CIAg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=agni&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greek Mythology]], [[Prometheus]], the ancient Greek god of Fire, who had aided [[Zeus]] in his fight against his father [[Cronus|Cronos]], was the son of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]], [[Iapetus (mythology)|Iapetus]]. He is believed to have brought fire to earth after stealing it from Zeus for use by mankind as an essential of civilized life; he is credited to have given man weapons of war, and also all miseries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Mythology|author=Arthur Cotterell|publisher=Hermes House|page=77|url= http://books.google.co.in/books/about/The_Ultimate_Encyclopedia_of_Mythology.html?id=mZobAQAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;
