* [[mobile telephone|Mobile cellular]]: 9.87 million lines, 110% penetration rate (2007).
* Telephone system:
** ''General assessment:'' an extensive but antiquated telecommunications network inherited from the Soviet era; quality has improved; the Bulgaria Telecommunications Company's fixed-line monopoly terminated in 2005 when alternative fixed-line operators were given access to its network; a drop in fixed-line connections in recent years has been more than offset by a sharp increase in mobile-cellular telephone use fostered by multiple service providers; the number of cellular telephone subscriptions now exceeds the population
** ''Domestic:''  a fairly modern digital cable trunk line now connects switching centers in most of the regions; the others are connected by digital microwave radio relay
** ''International:''  country code – 359; submarine cable provides connectivity to [[Ukraine]] and [[Russia]]; a combination submarine cable and land fiber-optic system provides connectivity to [[Italy]], [[Albania]], and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]; satellite earth stations – 3 (1 [[Intersputnik]] in the Atlantic Ocean region, 2 [[Intelsat]] in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean regions) (2007).
