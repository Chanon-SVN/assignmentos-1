The '''Order of Saint Benedict''' ('''OSB'''; [[Latin]]: ''Ordo Sancti Benedicti''), also known{{spaced ndash}}in reference to the colour of its members' [[Religious habit|habit]]s{{spaced ndash}}as the '''Black Monks''', is a [[Roman Catholic religious order]] of independent [[Christian monasticism|monastic]] [[Cenobium|communities]] that observe the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]]. Each community ([[monastery]], [[priory]] or [[abbey]]) within the order maintains its own [[wikt:autonomy|autonomy]], while the order itself represents their mutual interests. The terms &quot;Order of Saint Benedict&quot; and &quot;Benedictine Order&quot; are, however, also used to refer to Benedictine communities ''in toto'', sometimes giving the incorrect impression that there exists a [[Superior general|generalate]] or [[motherhouse]] with jurisdiction over them.

Internationally, the order is governed by the [[Benedictine Confederation]], a body, established in 1883 by [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s [[Papal brief|Brief]] ''Summum semper'', whose head is known as the [[Abbot|Abbot Primate]]. Individuals whose communities are members of the order generally add the initials &quot;OSB&quot; after their names.

== Historical development ==
[[File:Fra Angelico 031.jpg|thumb|right|Saint Benedict of Nursia (c.&amp;nbsp;480–543). Detail from a [[fresco]] by [[Fra Angelico]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1400–1455) in the [[Saint Mark's Basilica|Basilica San Marco]], [[Florence]].]]

The monastery at [[Subiaco, Lazio|Subiaco]] in Italy, established by [[Saint Benedict of Nursia]] [[circa]] 529, was the first of the dozen monasteries he founded. There is no evidence, however, that he intended to found an order and the Rule of Saint Benedict presupposes the autonomy of each community. As most monasteries founded during the Middle Ages adopted the Rule of St Benedict, it became a standard form of Western monasticism despite the absence of a Benedictine order.

Today, Benedictine monasticism is fundamentally different from other Western religious orders insofar as its individual communities are not part of a religious order with &quot;Generalates&quot; and &quot;Superiors General&quot;. Rather, in modern times, the various autonomous houses have formed themselves loosely into congregations (for example, Cassinese, English, Solesmes, Subiaco, Camaldolese, Sylvestrines) that in turn are represented in the [[Benedictine Confederation]] that came into existence through [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s Apostolic Brief &quot;Summum semper&quot; on July 12, 1883. This organization facilitates dialogue of Benedictine communities with each other and the relationship between Benedictine communities and other [[religious order]]s and the church at large.

The Rule of Saint Benedict is also used by a number of religious orders that began as reforms of the Benedictine tradition such as the [[Cistercian]]s and [[Trappist]]s although none of these groups are part of the [[Benedictine Confederation]].

The largest number of Benedictines are Roman Catholics, but there are also some within the [[Anglican Communion]] and occasionally within other Christian denominations as well, for example, within the [[Lutheran Church]].

===England===
In the [[English Reformation]], all [[Dissolution of the monasteries|monasteries were dissolved]] and their lands confiscated by the Crown, forcing their [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] members to flee into exile on the Continent. During the 19th century they were able to return to England, including to [[Selby Abbey]] in [[Yorkshire]], one of the few great monastic churches to survive the Dissolution.

[[Minster-in-Thanet|St. Mildred's Priory]], on the [[Isle of Thanet]], [[Kent]], was built in 1027 on the site of an abbey founded in 670 by the daughter of the first Christian [[King of Kent]]. Currently the priory is home to a community of Benedictine nuns. Four of the most notable English abbeys are the Basilica of St Gregory the Great at Downside, commonly known as [[Downside Abbey]], [[Ealing Abbey]] in Ealing, West London, St. Lawrence's in Yorkshire ([[Ampleforth Abbey]]), and [[Worth Abbey]].&lt;ref&gt;Colin Battell, OSB, &quot;Spirituality on the beach,&quot; ''The Tablet'' 2 December 2006, 18-19. The late Cardinal [[Basil Hume]] was Abbot of Ampleforth Abbey before being appointed Archbishop of Westminster.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Martin ''A Glimpse of Heaven: Catholic Churches in England and Wales'' (London: English Heritage, 2007). Examines the abbeys rebuilt after 1850 (by benefactors among the Catholic aristocracy and recusant squirearchy), mainly Benedictine but including a Cistercian Abbey at Mount St. Bernard (by Pugin) and a Carthusian Charterhouse in Sussex. There is a review of book by Richard Lethbridge &quot;Monuments to Catholic confidence,&quot; ''The Tablet'' 10 February 2007, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prinknash Abbey]], used by Henry VIII as a hunting lodge, was officially returned to the Benedictines four hundred years later, in 1928. During the next few years, so-called Prinknash Park was used as a home until it was returned to the order.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advent.org: Prinknash Abbey.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mian Ridge &quot;Prinknash monks downsize,&quot; ''The Tablet'' 12 November 2005, 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Oxford Movement]], there has also been a modest flourishing of Benedictine monasticism in the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican Church]] and Protestant Churches. Anglican Benedictine Abbots are invited&lt;!---invited, right? Not just &quot;drop by.&quot; :)---&gt; guests of the Benedictine Abbot Primate in Rome at Abbatial gatherings at Sant'Anselmo.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Rees, &quot;Anglican Monasticism,&quot; in ''Encyclopedia of Monasticism'' ed. William Johnston (New York: Fitzroy Dearborn Publisher, 2000), 29.&lt;/ref&gt; There are an estimated 2,400 celibate Anglican Religious (1,080 men and 1,320 women) in the Anglican Communion as a whole, some of whom have adopted the Rule of St. Benedict.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thekingdomisours.org.uk/communities.htm&lt;/ref&gt; For a full list of all historic Benedictine houses in England and Wales, see below.

===France===
Monasticism had been introduced into the region of modern France during the Roman era by Saint [[Martin of Tours]], who founded the first monastery in Western Europe. The Rule of St. Benedict was promoted by various rulers of France, especially the [[House of Capet]]. Figures such as [[Benedict of Aniane]] were authorized by the Emperor [[Louis the Pious]] and his successors to promote its adoption by monasteries throughout the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. It expanded throughout the next millennium, growing through periods of revival and decay over the centuries. Monasteries were among the institutions of the Catholic Church swept away during the [[French Revolution]].

Monasteries were again allowed to form in the 19th century under the [[Bourbon Restoration]]. Later that century, under the [[Third French Republic]], laws were enacted preventing religious teaching. The original intent was to allow secular schools. Thus in 1880 and 1882, Benedictine teaching monks were effectively exiled; this was not completed until 1901.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.st-benoit-du-lac.com/histoire1/history1.html] retrieved November 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Wk1KzHS1IagC&amp;pg=PA495&amp;lpg=PA495&amp;dq=-wikipedia+benedictines+expelled+from+france+1901&amp;source=web&amp;ots=7RydgvaUmY&amp;sig=e6nAEj6HiM6GS-WrGt1w1Fp3dpI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result] retrieved November 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02443a.htm CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: The Benedictine Order].

== Benedictine vow and life ==
[[File:BenedictineVespers.jpg|thumb|left|Benedictine [[monk]]s singing [[Vespers]] on [[Holy Saturday]] in [[Morristown, New Jersey]], USA.]]

Section 17 in chapter 58 of the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] states the solemn promise candidates for reception into a Benedictine community are required to make: a promise of stability (i.e. to remain in the same community), ''conversatio morum'' (an idiomatic Latin phrase suggesting &quot;conversion of manners&quot;; see below) and obedience (to the community's superior, seen as holding the place of Christ within it). This solemn commitment tends to be referred to as the &quot;Benedictine vow&quot; and is the Benedictine antecedent and equivalent of the [[evangelical counsels]] professed by candidates for reception into a [[religious order]].

Much scholarship over the last fifty years has been dedicated to the translation and interpretation of &quot;''conversatio morum''&quot;.  The older translation &quot;conversion of life&quot; has generally been replaced with phrases such as &quot;[conversion to] a monastic manner of life&quot;, drawing from the Vulgate's use of ''conversatio'' as a translation of &quot;citizenship&quot; or &quot;homeland&quot; in Philippians 3:20.  Some scholars have claimed that the vow formula of the Rule is best translated as &quot;to live in this place as a monk, in obedience to its rule and abbot.&quot;

Benedictine [[abbot]]s and [[abbess]]es have full jurisdiction of their [[abbey]] and thus absolute authority over the [[Roman Catholic monk|monk]]s or [[nun]]s who are resident.  This authority includes the power to assign duties, to decide which books may or may not be read, to regulate comings and goings, and to punish and to [[excommunicate]], in the sense of an enforced isolation from the monastic community.

A tight communal timetable{{spaced ndash}}the [[horarium]]{{spaced ndash}}is meant to ensure that the time given by God is not wasted but used in God's service, whether for prayer, work, meals, spiritual reading or sleep.

Although Benedictines do not take a vow of silence, hours of strict silence are set, and at other time silence is maintained as much as is practically possible. Social conversations tend to be limited to communal recreation times. But such details, like the many other details of the daily routine of a Benedictine house that the Rule of St Benedict leaves to the discretion of the superior, are set out in its customary.{{clarify|reason=No article for &quot;Customary&quot; in either Wikipedia or Wiktionary. It should either be explained or another word substituted|date=April 2013}}

In the Roman Catholic Church, according to the norms of the 1983 [[Code of Canon Law]], a Benedictine abbey is a &quot;[[religious institute]]&quot; and its members are therefore members of the [[consecrated life]]&lt;!--?: , commonly referred to as &quot;Religious&quot;--&gt;. While Canon Law 588 §1 explains that Benedictine monks are &quot;neither clerical nor lay&quot;, they can, however, be ordained. Benedictine [[Oblate (religion)|Oblate]]s endeavor to embrace the spirit of the Benedictine vow in their own life in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=928 |work=Catechism of the Catholic Church |url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p123a9p4.htm#III |accessdate=2009-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
