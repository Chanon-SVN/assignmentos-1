'''Armadillos''' are [[New World]] [[placental]] [[mammal]]s with a leathery [[armour (zoology)|armor]] shell.  '''Dasypodidae''' is the only surviving [[family (biology)|family]] in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Cingulata]], part of the superorder [[Xenarthra]], along with the [[anteater]]s and [[sloth]]s. The word ''armadillo'' means &quot;little armored one&quot; in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. The [[Aztecs]] called them ''āyōtōchtli'' {{IPA-nah|aːjoːˈtoːt͡ʃt͡ɬi|}}, [[Nahuatl]] for “turtle-rabbit”:&lt;ref name=&quot;dic&quot; /&gt; ''āyōtl'' {{IPA-nah|ˈaːjoːt͡ɬ|}} (turtle) and ''tōchtli'' {{IPA-nah|ˈtoːt͡ʃt͡ɬi|}} (rabbit).&lt;ref name=&quot;dic&quot;&gt;''Nahuatl dictionary.''

Retrieved 10 September 2012, from [http://whp.uoregon.edu/dictionaries/nahuatl/index.lasso link]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--&lt;ref&gt; This book used the term &quot;azotochtli&quot;, but that word is wrong. The word is &quot;ayotochtli&quot; {{cite book | title=The Encyclopedia of Tracks &amp; Scats | author=McDougall, Len | publisher=Globe Pequot | page=266 | year=2004 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9XOc2_u7z6cC | isbn=9781592280704}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

About 10 [[extant taxon|extant]] [[genus|genera]] and 20 extant [[species]] of armadillo have been described, some of which are distinguished by the number of bands on their armor. Their average length is about {{convert|75|cm|in|abbr=on}}, including tail. The [[giant armadillo]] grows up to {{convert|150|cm|in|abbr=on}} and weighs up to {{convert|54|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, while the [[pink fairy armadillo]] is a diminutive species, with an overall length of {{convert|13|to|15|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}. All species are native to the [[Americas]], where they inhabit a variety of environments.

Like all other xenarthran lineages, armadillos originated in [[South America]]. Due to the continent's former isolation, they were confined there for most of the [[Cenozoic]]. The recent formation of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] allowed a few members of the family to migrate northward into southern [[North America]] by the early [[Pleistocene]], as part of the [[Great American Interchange]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodburne2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woodburne|first1=M. O.|title=The Great American Biotic Interchange: Dispersals, Tectonics, Climate, Sea Level and Holding Pens|journal=Journal of Mammalian Evolution|volume= 17|issue= 4|date= 14 July 2010|pages= 245–264 (see p. 249)|doi= 10.1007/s10914-010-9144-8|pmid=21125025|pmc=2987556}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Some of their much larger [[Cingulata|cingulate]] relatives, the [[pampathere]]s and [[glyptodont]]s, made the same journey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woodburne2010&quot;/&gt;)

Today, all extant armadillos species are still present in South America. They are particularly diverse in [[Paraguay]] (where eleven species exist) and surrounding areas. Many species are endangered. Some, including four species of ''[[Dasypus]]'', are widely distributed over the Americas, whereas others, such as [[Yepes's mulita]], are restricted to small ranges. Two species, the [[northern naked-tailed armadillo]] and [[nine-banded armadillo]], are found in [[Central America]]; the latter has also reached the United States, primarily in the south-central states (notably Texas), but with a range that extends as far east as [[South Carolina]] and [[Florida]], and as far north as [[Nebraska]] and central [[Indiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Associated Press |url=http://www.theindychannel.com/news/local-news/armadillos-slinking-their-way-into-indiana |title=Armadillos slinking their way into Indiana |publisher=TheIndyChannel.com |date=2014-06-07 |accessdate=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their range has consistently expanded in North America over the last century due to a lack of natural predators.

==Habitat and anatomy==
Armadillos are small to medium-sized mammals. The smallest species, the [[pink fairy armadillo]], is roughly [[chipmunk]]-sized at {{convert|85|g|oz|abbr=on}} and {{convert|13|-|15|cm|in|abbr=on}} in total length. The largest species, the [[giant armadillo]], can be the size of a small [[pig]], weigh up to {{convert|54|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and can be {{convert|150|cm|in|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/armadillo/|title=Armadillos, Armadillo Pictures, Armadillo Facts|publisher=Animals.nationalgeographic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are prolific diggers. Many species use their sharp claws to dig for food, such as [[Larva|grubs]], and to dig dens. The nine-banded armadillo prefers to build [[burrow]]s in moist [[soil]] near the creeks, streams, and [[arroyo (creek)|arroyos]] around which it lives and feeds. The diets of different armadillo species vary, but consist mainly of [[insect]]s, grubs, and other [[invertebrate]]s. Some species, however, feed almost entirely on ants and termites.
[[File:Mani armadilli.png|thumb|left|Paws of a hairy and a giant armadillo]]
In common with other [[xenarthra]]ns, armadillos in general, have low [[Thermoregulation|body temperature]]s (33–36°C) and [[basal metabolic rate]]s (from 40–60% of that expected in placental mammals of their mass). This is particularly true of types that specialize in using termites as their primary food source (for example, ''[[Priodontes]]'' and ''[[Tolypeutes]]'').&lt;ref name = &quot;McNab&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

The armor is formed by plates of [[dermal bone]] covered in relatively small, overlapping epidermal scales called &quot;[[scute]]s&quot;, composed of bone with a covering of horn. Most species have rigid shields over the shoulders and hips, with a number of bands separated by flexible skin covering the back and flanks. Additional armor covers the top of the head, the upper parts of the limbs, and the tail. The underside of the animal is never armored, and is simply covered with soft skin and fur.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoM&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor=Macdonald, D. |author=Dickman, Christopher R. |year=1984 |title=The Encyclopedia of Mammals |publisher=Facts on File |location=New York |pages=781–783 |isbn=0-87196-871-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This armor-like skin appears to be the main defense of many armadillos, although most escape predators by fleeing (often into thorny patches, from which their armor protects them) or digging to safety. Only the [[South America]]n three-banded armadillos (''Tolypeutes'') rely heavily on their armor for protection. When threatened by a [[predator]], ''Tolypeutes'' species frequently roll up into a ball. Other armadillo species cannot roll up because they have too many plates. The North American nine-banded armadillo tends to jump straight in the air when surprised, and consequently often collides with the undercarriage or fenders of passing vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/armadillo.html |title=How high can a nine-banded armadillo jump?

Armadillos have short legs, but can move quite quickly, and have the ability to remain under water for as long as six minutes. Because of the density of its armor, an armadillo will sink in water unless it swallows air, inflating its stomach to twice normal size and raising its buoyancy above that of water, allowing it to swim across narrow streams and ditches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20090609190517/http://www.flex.net/~lonestar/armadillo.htm Armadillos – Nine-Banded Armadillo – Texas Wildlife]. flex.net.&lt;/ref&gt;

Armadillos have very poor eyesight, and use their keen sense of smell to hunt for food.&lt;ref&gt;[http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/mammals/armadillo/?source=A-to-Z Armadillo]. animals.nationalgeographic.com&lt;/ref&gt;
They use their claws for digging and finding food, as well as for making their homes in burrows. They dig their burrows with their claws, making only a single corridor the width of the animal's body. They have five clawed toes on their hindfeet, and three to five toes with heavy digging claws on their forefeet. Armadillos have a large number of cheek teeth, which are not divided into [[premolar]]s and [[molar (tooth)|molar]]s, but usually have [[incisor]]s or [[canine (tooth)|canine]]s. The [[dentition]] of the nine-banded armadillo is P 7/7, M 1/1 = 32.&lt;ref name=Freeman&amp;Genoways&gt;{{Cite journal |date=December 1998 |author=Freeman, Patricia W., &amp; Genoways, Hugh H |title=Recent Northern Records of the Nine-banded Armadillo (Dasypodidae) in Nebraska |journal=The Southwestern Naturalist |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=491–504 |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&amp;context=museummammalogy |accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gestation]] lasts from 60 to 120 days, depending on species, although the nine-banded armadillo also exhibits [[delayed implantation]], so the young are not typically born for eight months after mating. Most members of the genus ''Dasypus'' give birth to four [[monozygotic]] young (that is, identical quadruplets),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bagatto|first=B|coauthors=D.A. Crossley and W.W. Burggren|title=Physiological variability in neonatal armadillo quadruplets: within- and between-litter differences|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|date=1 June 2000|series=159|pages=267–277|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/203/11/1733.short|pmid=10804163|volume=203|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other species may have typical litter sizes that range from one to eight. The young are born with soft, leathery skin, which hardens within a few weeks. They reach sexual maturity in three to 12 months, depending on the species. Armadillos are solitary animals that do not share their burrows with other adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoM&quot; /&gt;

==Armadillos and humans==

===In science===
Armadillos are often used in the study of [[leprosy]], since they, along with [[mangabey (disambiguation)|mangabey]] [[monkey]]s, [[rabbit]]s and [[Mouse|mice]] (on their footpads), are among the few known species that can contract the disease systemically. They are particularly susceptible due to their unusually low body temperature, which is hospitable to the leprosy bacterium, ''[[Mycobacterium leprae]]''. (The leprosy bacterium is difficult to culture and armadillos have a body temperature of {{convert|34|C}}, similar to human skin.) Humans can acquire a leprosy infection from armadillos by handling them or consuming armadillo meat. Armadillos are a presumed [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] and [[natural reservoir]] for the disease in Texas and Louisiana.&lt;ref name=&quot;Truman 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Truman |first1=Richard W. |last2=Singh |first2=Pushpendra |last3=Sharma |first3=Rahul |last4=Busso |first4=Philippe |last5=Rougemont |first5=Jacques |last6=Paniz-Mondolfi |first6=Alberto |last7=Kapopoulou |first7=Adamandia |last8=Brisse |first8=Sylvain |last9=Scollard |first9=David M. |last10=Gillis |first10=Thomas P. |last11=Cole |first11=Stewart T. |date=April 28, 2011 |title=Probable Zoonotic Leprosy in the Southern United States |journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |location=Waltham, MA |publisher=[[Massachusetts Medical Society]] |volume=364 |issue=17 |pages=1626-1633 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1010536 |issn= |pmc=3138484 |pmid=21524213 |display-authors=3 |accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[European colonization of the Americas|arrival of Europeans in the late 15th century]], leprosy was unknown in the New World. Given that armadillos are native to the New World, at some point they must have acquired the disease from humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Truman 2011&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Armadillos Can Transmit Leprosy to Humans, Federal Studies Confirm |author=Gardiner Harris |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/health/28leprosy.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=27 April 2011 |accessdate=3 May 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110506074826/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/28/health/28leprosy.html| archivedate= 6 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The armadillo is also a [[natural reservoir]] for [[Chagas disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yaeger RG |title=The prevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in armadillos collected at a site near New Orleans, Louisiana |journal=The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=323–6 |date=March 1988  |pmid=3128127 |url=http://www.ajtmh.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=3128127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nine-banded armadillo also serves science through its unusual [[reproduction|reproductive]] system, in which four [[genetics|genetically]] identical offspring are born, the result of one original egg.&lt;ref name=&quot;ufl&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/UW082 |title=The Nine-banded Armadillo (''Dasypus novemcinctus'') |publisher=Edis.ifas.ufl.edu |accessdate=17 December 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100102145948/http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/uw082| archivedate= 2 January 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;valdosta&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |date=May–June 1998 |author=Loughry, W.J; Prodohl, Paulo A; McDonough, Colleen M; &amp; [[John Avise|Avise, John C]]|title=Polyembryony in Armadillos |journal=[[American Scientist]] |volume=86 |pages=274–279 |url=http://www.valdosta.edu/~jloughry/Reprints/AmSci.pdf |bibcode=1998AmSci..86..274L |doi=10.1511/1998.3.274 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamlett1933&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |date=September 1933 |author=Hamlett, G.W.D |title=Polyembryony in the Armadillo: Genetic or Physiological? |journal=[[The Quarterly Review of Biology]] |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=348–358 |jstor=2808431  |doi=10.1086/394444}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because they are always genetically identical, the group of four young provides a good subject for scientific, behavioral or medical tests that need consistent biological and genetic makeup in the test subjects. This is the only reliable manifestation of [[polyembryony]] in the class [[Mammalia]], and only exists within the genus ''[[Dasypus]]'' and not in all armadillos, as is commonly believed. Other species that display this trait include parasitoid wasps, certain flatworms and various aquatic invertebrates.&lt;ref name=&quot;valdosta&quot; /&gt;

Armadillos (mainly ''Dasypus'') are common [[roadkill]] due to their habit of jumping three to four feet vertically when startled, which puts them into collision with the underside of vehicles. Wildlife enthusiasts are using the northward march of the armadillo as an opportunity to educate others about the animals, which can be a burrowing nuisance to property owners and managers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ufl&quot; /&gt;
