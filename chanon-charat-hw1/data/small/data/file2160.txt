'''Bluetooth''' is a [[wireless]] technology standard for exchanging data over short distances (using short-wavelength [[UHF]] [[radio waves]] in the [[ISM band]] from 2.4 to 2.485&amp;nbsp;GHz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Pages/Fast-Facts.aspx|title=Fast Facts|publisher=Bluetooth.com |accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) from fixed and mobile devices, and building [[personal area network]]s (PANs). Invented by telecom vendor [[Ericsson]] in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bluetooth traveler|publisher=hoovers.com|url=http://www.hoovers.com/business-information/--pageid__13751--/global-hoov-index.xhtml|accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was originally conceived as a wireless alternative to [[RS-232]] data cables. It can connect several devices, overcoming problems of synchronization.

Bluetooth is managed by the [[Bluetooth Special Interest Group]] (SIG), which has more than 20,000 member companies in the areas of telecommunication, computing, networking, and consumer electronics.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Newton, Harold. (2007). ''Newton’s telecom dictionary.'' New York: Flatiron Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Bluetooth was standardized as '''IEEE 802.15.1''', but the standard is no longer maintained. The SIG oversees the development of the specification, manages the qualification program, and protects the trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.org/About/bluetooth_sig.htm |title=Bluetooth.org |publisher=Bluetooth.org |accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To be marketed as a Bluetooth device, it must be [[Bluetooth Special Interest Group#Qualification|qualified]] to standards defined by the SIG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/bluetooth-brand/brand-enforcement-program |title=Brand Enforcement Program |publisher=Bluetooth.org |accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A network of [[patent]]s is required to implement the technology, which is licensed only for that qualifying device.

==Name and logo==
[[File:Bluetooth.svg|thumb|upright|right|Bluetooth logo]]
The word &quot;Bluetooth&quot; is an [[anglicisation|anglicized]] version of the Scandinavian ''Blåtand''/''Blåtann'', ([[Old Norse]] ''blátǫnn'') the [[epithet]] of the tenth-century king [[Harald Bluetooth]] who united dissonant Danish tribes into a single kingdom and, according to legend, introduced Christianity as well. The idea of this name was proposed in 1997 by [[Jim Kardach]] who developed a system that would allow mobile phones to communicate with computers. At the time of this proposal he was reading [[Frans G. Bengtsson]]'s historical novel ''[[The Long Ships]]'' about Vikings and king Harald Bluetooth.&lt;ref name=&quot;EETimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The Bluetooth logo is a [[bind rune]] merging the [[Younger Futhark]] [[runic alphabet|runes]] [[File:Runic letter ior.svg|8px]]&amp;nbsp;([[Haglaz|Hagall]]) (ᚼ) and [[File:Runic letter berkanan.svg|8px]]&amp;nbsp;([[Berkanan|Bjarkan]]) (ᛒ), Harald's initials.

==Implementation==
Bluetooth operates in the range of 2400–2483.5&amp;nbsp;MHz (including guard bands). This is in the globally unlicensed (but not unregulated) Industrial, Scientific and Medical ([[ISM band|ISM]]) 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz short-range radio frequency band. Bluetooth uses a radio technology called [[frequency-hopping spread spectrum]]. The transmitted data are divided into packets and each packet is transmitted on one of the 79 designated Bluetooth channels. Each channel has a bandwidth of 1&amp;nbsp;MHz. Bluetooth 4.0 uses 2&amp;nbsp;MHz spacing which allows for 40 channels. The first channel starts at 2402&amp;nbsp;MHz and continues up to 2480&amp;nbsp;MHz in 1&amp;nbsp;MHz steps. It usually performs 1600&amp;nbsp;hops per second, with [[Frequency-hopping spread spectrum#Variations of FHSS|Adaptive Frequency-Hopping]] (AFH) enabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/wireless/bluetooth/radio-interface-modulation.php |title=Bluetooth Radio Interface, Modulation &amp; Channels |publisher=Radio-Electronics.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, [[Gaussian frequency-shift keying]] (GFSK) modulation was the only modulation scheme available; subsequently, since the introduction of Bluetooth 2.0+EDR, π/4-[[DQPSK]] and 8DPSK modulation may also be used between compatible devices. Devices functioning with GFSK are said to be operating in basic rate (BR) mode where an instantaneous [[Bit rate|data rate]] of 1&amp;nbsp;[[Data rate units|Mbit/s]] is possible. The term Enhanced Data Rate (EDR) is used to describe π/4-DPSK and 8DPSK schemes, each giving 2 and 3&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s respectively. The combination of these (BR and EDR) modes in Bluetooth radio technology is classified as a &quot;BR/EDR radio&quot;.

Bluetooth is a [[Packet based|packet-based protocol]] with a [[Master-slave (technology)|master-slave structure]]. One master may communicate with up to seven slaves in a [[piconet]]; all devices share the master's clock. Packet exchange is based on the basic clock, defined by the master, which ticks at 312.5&amp;nbsp;µs intervals. Two clock ticks make up a slot of 625&amp;nbsp;[[µs]]; two slots make up a slot pair of 1250&amp;nbsp;µs. In the simple case of single-slot packets the master transmits in even slots and receives in odd slots; the slave, conversely, receives in even slots and transmits in odd slots. Packets may be 1, 3 or 5 slots long, but in all cases the master transmit will begin in even slots and the slave transmit in odd slots.

===Communication and connection===
A master Bluetooth device can communicate with a maximum of seven devices in a piconet (an ad-hoc computer network using Bluetooth technology), though not all devices reach this maximum.&lt;!-- This sentence contains redundant text, repeated from previous paragraph. --&gt; The devices can switch roles, by agreement, and the slave can become the master (for example, a headset initiating a connection to a phone will necessarily begin as master, as initiator of the connection; but may subsequently prefer to be slave).

The Bluetooth Core Specification provides for the connection of two or more piconets to form a [[scatternet]], in which certain devices simultaneously play the master role in one piconet and the slave role in another.

At any given time, data can be transferred between the master and one other device (except for the little-used broadcast mode.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}) The master chooses which slave device to address; typically, it switches rapidly from one device to another in a [[round-robin scheduling|round-robin]] fashion. Since it is the master that chooses which slave to address, whereas a slave is (in theory) supposed to listen in each receive slot, being a master is a lighter burden than being a slave. Being a master of seven slaves is possible; being a slave of more than one master is difficult.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} The specification is vague as to required behavior in scatternets.

Many USB Bluetooth [[adapter (computing)|adapters]] or &quot;dongles&quot; are available, some of which also include an [[IrDA]] adapter.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Bluetooth is a standard wire-replacement communications protocol primarily designed for low-power consumption, with a short range based on low-cost [[transceiver]] [[integrated circuit|microchips]] in each device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Because the devices use a radio (broadcast) communications system, they do not have to be in visual line of sight of each other, however a ''[[Quasi-optical|quasi optical]]'' wireless path must be viable.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;  Range is power-class-dependent, but effective ranges vary in practice; see the table on the right.

The effective range varies due to propagation conditions, material coverage, production sample variations, antenna configurations and battery conditions. Most Bluetooth applications are in indoor conditions, where attenuation of walls and signal fading due to signal reflections will cause the range to be far lower than the specified line-of-sight ranges of the Bluetooth products. Most Bluetooth applications are battery powered Class&amp;nbsp;2 devices, with little difference in range whether the other end of the link is a Class&amp;nbsp;1 or Class&amp;nbsp;2 device as the lower powered device tends to set the range limit. In some cases the effective range of the data link can be extended when a Class&amp;nbsp;2 devices is connecting to a Class&amp;nbsp;1 transceiver with both higher sensitivity and transmission power than a typical Class&amp;nbsp;2 device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amperordirect.com/pc/r-electronic-resource/z-reference-bluetooth-class1-myth.html |title=Class 1 Bluetooth Dongle Test |publisher=Amperordirect.com |accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mostly however the Class&amp;nbsp;1 devices have a similar sensitivity to Class&amp;nbsp;2 devices. Connecting two Class&amp;nbsp;1 devices with both high sensitivity and high power can allow ranges far in excess of the typical 100m, depending on the throughput required by the application. Some such devices allow open field ranges of up to 1&amp;nbsp;km and beyond between two similar devices without exceeding legal emission limits.&lt;ref name=&quot;WT41&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluegiga.com/WT41_Long_Range_Bluetooth_Module |title=WT41 Long Range Bluetooth Module}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BluBear&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesswire.com/en/products/embedded-wireless-modules/bluetooth/bluebear/overview/ |title=BluBear Industrial Long Range Bluetooth 2.1 Module with EDR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OBS433&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.connectblue.com/products/classic-bluetooth-products/classic-bluetooth-modules/bluetooth-serial-port-module-obs433/ |title=OEM Bluetooth Serial Port Module OBS433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Bluetooth Core Specification does mandate minimal for range, the range of the technology is application-specific and not limited. Manufacturers may tune their implementations to the range needed for individual use cases.

===Bluetooth profiles===
{{Main|Bluetooth profile}}

To use Bluetooth wireless technology, a device has to be able to interpret certain Bluetooth profiles, which are definitions of possible applications and specify general behaviours that Bluetooth enabled devices use to communicate with other Bluetooth devices. These profiles include settings to parametrize and to control the communication from start. Adherence to profiles saves the time for transmitting the parameters anew before the bi-directional link becomes effective. There are a wide range of Bluetooth profiles that describe many different types of applications or use cases for devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developer.bluetooth.org/TechnologyOverview/Pages/Profiles.aspx |title=Profiles Overview |publisher=Bluetooth.com |accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ian|first=Paul|title=Wi-Fi Direct vs. Bluetooth 4.0: A Battle for Supremacy|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/208778/Wi_Fi_Direct_vs_Bluetooth_4_0_A_Battle_for_Supremacy.html|publisher=PC World|accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bluetooth vs. Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)===
Bluetooth and [[Wi-Fi]] (the brand name for products using [[IEEE 802.11]] standards) have some similar applications: setting up networks, printing, or transferring files. Wi-Fi is intended as a replacement for high speed cabling for general [[local area network]] access in work areas. This category of applications is sometimes called [[wireless local area network]]s (WLAN). Bluetooth was intended for portable equipment and its applications. The category of applications is outlined as the wireless [[personal area network]] (WPAN). Bluetooth is a replacement for cabling in a variety of personally carried applications in any setting and also works for fixed location applications such as smart energy functionality in the home (thermostats, etc.).

Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are to some extent complementary in their applications and usage. Wi-Fi is usually access point-centered, with an asymmetrical client-server connection with all traffic routed through the access point, while Bluetooth is usually symmetrical, between two Bluetooth devices. Bluetooth serves well in simple applications where two devices need to connect with minimal configuration like a button press, as in headsets and remote controls, while Wi-Fi suits better in applications where some degree of client configuration is possible and high speeds are required, especially for network access through an access node. However, Bluetooth access points do exist and ad-hoc connections are possible with Wi-Fi though not as simply as with Bluetooth. [[Wi-Fi Direct]] was recently developed to add a more Bluetooth-like ad-hoc functionality to Wi-Fi.

===Devices===
[[File:Drone 4.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A Bluetooth [[USB]] dongle with a 100&amp;nbsp;m range.]]
Bluetooth exists in many products, such as telephones, tablets, media players, robotics systems, handheld, laptops and console gaming equipment, and some high definition [[Headset (audio)|headsets]], [[modem]]s, and watches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/English/Products/Pages/Watch.aspx |title=Watch |publisher=Bluetooth.com |accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology is useful when transferring information between two or more devices that are near each other in low-bandwidth situations. Bluetooth is commonly used to transfer sound data with telephones (i.e., with a Bluetooth headset) or byte data with hand-held computers (transferring files).

Bluetooth protocols simplify the discovery and setup of services between devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Devices&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howstuffworks.com/bluetooth.htm |title=How Bluetooth Works|publisher=How Stuff Works |date=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bluetooth devices can advertise all of the services they provide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Specification%20Documents/AssignedNumbersServiceDiscovery.pdf |title=Specification Documents |publisher=Bluetooth.com |date=30 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes using services easier, because more of the security, network address and permission configuration can be automated than with many other network types.&lt;ref name=&quot;Devices&quot; /&gt;

==Computer requirements==
[[File:BluetoothUSB.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A typical Bluetooth [[USB]] dongle.]]
[[File:DELL TrueMobile 350 Bluetooth card.jpg|thumb|250px|right|An internal notebook Bluetooth card (14×36×4&amp;nbsp;mm).]]
A personal computer that does not have embedded Bluetooth can be used with a Bluetooth adapter that will enable the PC to communicate with other Bluetooth devices. While some [[desktop computer]]s and most recent laptops come with a built-in Bluetooth radio, others will require an external one in the form of a [[dongle]].

Unlike its predecessor, [[Infrared Data Association|IrDA]], which requires a separate adapter for each device, Bluetooth allows multiple devices to communicate with a computer over a single adapter.

===Operating system implementation===
{{details|Bluetooth stack}}

[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] products have worked with Bluetooth since [[Mac&amp;nbsp;OS&amp;nbsp;X v10.2]] which was released in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

|accessdate=4 February 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Microsoft]] platforms, [[Windows XP Service Pack 2]] and SP3
releases work natively with Bluetooth 1.1, 2.0 and 2.0+EDR.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinBT 2010 FAQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/c/5/9c5b2167-8017-4bae-9fde-d599bac8184a/Bth_FAQ.docx |title=Bluetooth Wireless Technology FAQ&amp;nbsp;– 2010 |accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Previous versions required users to install their Bluetooth adapter's own drivers, which were not directly supported by Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=1 February 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Microsoft's own Bluetooth dongles (packaged with their Bluetooth computer devices) have no external drivers and thus require at least Windows XP Service Pack 2. Windows Vista RTM/SP1 with the Feature Pack for Wireless or Windows Vista SP2 work with Bluetooth 2.1+EDR.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinBT 2010 FAQ&quot; /&gt; Windows 7 works with Bluetooth 2.1+EDR and Extended Inquiry Response (EIR).&lt;ref name=&quot;WinBT 2010 FAQ&quot; /&gt;

The Windows XP and Windows Vista/Windows 7 Bluetooth stacks support the following Bluetooth profiles natively: PAN, SPP, [[Dial-up Internet access|DUN]], HID, HCRP. The Windows XP stack can be replaced by a third party stack which may support more profiles or newer versions of Bluetooth. The Windows Vista/Windows 7 Bluetooth stack supports vendor-supplied additional profiles without requiring the Microsoft stack to be replaced.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinBT 2010 FAQ&quot; /&gt;

[[Linux]] has two popular [[Bluetooth stack]]s, [[BlueZ]] and Affix. The BlueZ stack is included with most Linux kernels and was originally developed by [[Qualcomm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluez.org/ |title=Official Linux Bluetooth protocol stack |publisher=BlueZ |accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Affix stack was developed by [[Nokia]].
[[FreeBSD]] features Bluetooth since its 5.0 release.
[[NetBSD]] features Bluetooth since its 4.0 release. Its Bluetooth stack has been ported to [[OpenBSD]] as well.

==Specifications and features==
The development of the short link radio technology, later named Bluetooth was initiated by Nils Rydbeck CTO at Ericson Mobile in [[Lund]]. The purpose was to create a wireless headset, according to two inventions, presented in 1989, {{ cite patent |country=SE |number=8902098-6 |gdate=1989-06-12 }} and 1992 {{ cite patent |country=SE |number=9202239 |gdate=1992-07-24 }} by Dr. [[Johan Ullman]]. Nils Rydbeck tasked Tord Wingren with specifying and [[Jaap Haartsen]] and Sven Mattisson with developing, who were working for [[Ericsson]] in [[Lund]], Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=1 February 2008
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The specification is based on [[frequency-hopping spread spectrum]] technology.

The specifications were formalized by the [[Bluetooth Special Interest Group]] (SIG). The SIG was formally announced on 20 May 1998. Today it has a membership of over 20,000 companies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.org/en-us/members/introduction-to-membership |title=English Introduction to Membership |publisher=Bluetooth.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established by [[Ericsson]], [[IBM]], [[Intel]], [[Toshiba]] and [[Nokia]], and later joined by many other companies.

All versions of the Bluetooth standards are designed for downward compatibility.{{clarify|date=June 2014|reason=needs qualification as to up to which version, possibly date, as Bluetooth 4.0 (Smart) is supposedly not downwards compatible. This could be improved by giving a compatibilty matrix here.}} That lets the latest standard cover all older versions.

The Bluetooth Core Specification Working Group (CSWG) produces mainly 4 kinds of specifications
* The Bluetooth Core Specification, release cycle is typically a few years in between
* Core Specification Addendum (CSA), release cycle can be as tight as a few times per year
* Core Specification Supplements (CSS), can be released very quickly
* Errata

===Bluetooth v1.0 and v1.0B===
Versions 1.0 and 1.0B had many problems, and manufacturers had difficulty making their products interoperable. Versions 1.0 and 1.0B also included mandatory Bluetooth hardware device address (BD_ADDR) transmission in the Connecting process (rendering anonymity impossible at the protocol level), which was a major setback for certain services planned for use in Bluetooth environments.

===Bluetooth v1.1===
* Ratified as [[IEEE 802.15#Task group 1 (WPAN/Bluetooth)|IEEE Standard 802.15.1–2002]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/servlet/opac?punumber=7932 |title=IEEE Std 802.15.1–2002&amp;nbsp;– IEEE Standard for Information technology&amp;nbsp;– Telecommunications and information exchange between systems&amp;nbsp;– Local and metropolitan area networks&amp;nbsp;– Specific requirements Part 15.1: Wireless Medium Access Control (MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications for Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs) |doi=10.1109/IEEESTD.2002.93621 |publisher=Ieeexplore.ieee.org |accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many errors found in the 1.0B specifications were fixed.
* Added possibility of non-encrypted channels.
* Received Signal Strength Indicator ([[RSSI]]).

===Bluetooth v1.2===
Major enhancements include the following:
* Faster Connection and Discovery
* ''Adaptive [[frequency-hopping spread spectrum]] (AFH)'', which improves resistance to [[radio frequency interference]] by avoiding the use of crowded frequencies in the hopping sequence.
* Higher transmission speeds in practice, up to 721 kbit/s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Guy Kewney&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; than in v1.1.
* Extended Synchronous Connections (eSCO), which improve voice quality of audio links by allowing retransmissions of corrupted packets, and may optionally increase audio latency to provide better concurrent data transfer.
* [[Bluetooth protocols#Host/controller interface (HCI)|Host Controller Interface]] (HCI) operation with three-wire [[Universal asynchronous receiver/transmitter|UART]].

* Introduced Flow Control and Retransmission Modes for L2CAP.

===Bluetooth v2.0 + EDR===
This version of the Bluetooth Core Specification was released in 2004. The main difference is the introduction of an Enhanced Data Rate (EDR) for [[Bit rate|faster data transfer]]. The nominal rate of EDR is about 3 Mbit/s, although the practical data transfer rate is 2.1 Mbit/s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guy Kewney&quot; /&gt; EDR uses a combination of [[Gaussian frequency-shift keying|GFSK]] and [[Phase shift keying|Phase Shift Keying]] modulation (PSK) with two variants, π/4-[[DQPSK]] and 8[[DPSK]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bluetooth_specs&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=3 May 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; EDR can provide a lower power consumption through a reduced [[duty cycle]].

The specification is published as &quot;Bluetooth v2.0 + EDR&quot; which implies that EDR is an optional feature. Aside from EDR, there are other minor improvements to the 2.0 specification, and products may claim compliance to &quot;Bluetooth v2.0&quot; without supporting the higher data rate. At least one commercial device states &quot;Bluetooth v2.0 without EDR&quot; on its data sheet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bluetooth v2.1 + EDR===
Bluetooth Core Specification Version 2.1 + EDR was adopted by the Bluetooth SIG on 26 July 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;bluetooth_specs&quot; /&gt;

The headline feature of 2.1 is secure simple pairing (SSP): this improves the pairing experience for Bluetooth devices, while increasing the use and strength of security. See the section on [[#Pairing|Pairing]] below for more details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|date=3 August 2006
|title=Simple Pairing Whitepaper
|version=Version V10r00

2.1 allows various other improvements, including &quot;Extended inquiry response&quot; (EIR), which provides more information during the inquiry procedure to allow better filtering of devices before connection; and sniff subrating, which reduces the power consumption in low-power mode.

===Bluetooth v3.0 + HS===
Version 3.0 + HS of the Bluetooth Core Specification&lt;ref name=&quot;bluetooth_specs&quot; /&gt; was adopted by the Bluetooth SIG on 21 April 2009. Bluetooth 3.0+HS provides theoretical data transfer speeds of up to '''24 Mbit/s,''' though not over the Bluetooth link itself. Instead, the Bluetooth link is used for negotiation and establishment, and the high data rate traffic is carried over a colocated [[IEEE 802.11|802.11]] link.

The main new feature is AMP (Alternative MAC/PHY), the addition of [[IEEE 802.11|802.11]] as a high speed transport. The High-Speed part of the specification is not mandatory, and hence only devices sporting the &quot;+HS&quot; will actually support the Bluetooth over 802.11 high-speed data transfer. A Bluetooth 3.0 device without the &quot;+HS&quot; suffix will not support High Speed, and needs to only support a feature introduced in Core Specification Version 3.0&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bluetooth.org/docman/handlers/DownloadDoc.ashx?doc_id=40560|title=Bluetooth Core Version 3.0 + HS specification}}&lt;/ref&gt; or earlier Core Specification Addendum 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.bluetooth.org/DocMan/handlers/DownloadDoc.ashx?doc_id=119993|title=Bluetooth Core Specification Addendum (CSA) 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;[[#L2CAP|L2CAP]] Enhanced modes: Enhanced Retransmission Mode (ERTM) implements reliable L2CAP channel, while Streaming Mode (SM) implements unreliable channel with no retransmission or flow control. Introduced in Core Specification Addendum 1.
;Alternative MAC/PHY: Enables the use of alternative [[Media Access Control|MAC]] and [[PHY]]s for transporting Bluetooth profile data. The Bluetooth radio is still used for device discovery, initial connection and profile configuration, however when large quantities of data need to be sent, the high speed alternative MAC PHY 802.11 (typically associated with Wi-Fi) will be used to transport the data. This means that the proven low power connection models of Bluetooth are used when the system is idle, and the faster radio is used when large quantities of data need to be sent. AMP links require enhanced L2CAP modes.
;Unicast Connectionless Data: Permits service data to be sent without establishing an explicit L2CAP channel. It is intended for use by applications that require low latency between user action and reconnection/transmission of data. This is only appropriate for small amounts of data.
;Enhanced Power Control: Updates the power control feature to remove the open loop power control, and also to clarify ambiguities in power control introduced by the new modulation schemes added for EDR. Enhanced power control removes the ambiguities by specifying the behaviour that is expected. The feature also adds closed loop power control, meaning RSSI filtering can start as the response is received. Additionally, a &quot;go straight to maximum power&quot; request has been introduced. This is expected to deal with the headset link loss issue typically observed when a user puts their phone into a pocket on the opposite side to the headset.

====Ultra-wideband====
The high speed (AMP) feature of Bluetooth v3.0 was originally intended for [[Ultra-wideband|UWB]], but the WiMedia Alliance, the body responsible for the flavor of UWB intended for Bluetooth, announced in March 2009 that it was disbanding, and ultimately UWB was omitted from the Core v3.0 specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 March 2009, the [[WiMedia Alliance]] announced it was entering into technology transfer agreements for the WiMedia [[Ultra-wideband]] (UWB) specifications. WiMedia has transferred all current and future specifications, including work on future high speed and power optimized implementations, to the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG), [[Wireless USB]] Promoter Group and the [[USB Implementers Forum]]. After the successful completion of the technology transfer, marketing and related administrative items, the WiMedia Alliance will cease operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimedia.org/ |title=Wimedia.org |publisher=Wimedia.org |date=4 January 2010 |accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimedia.org/imwp/download.asp?ContentID=15508 |title=Wimedia.org |publisher=Wimedia.org |accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wimedia.org/imwp/download.asp?ContentID=15506 |title=Wimedia.org |accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bluetooth.com/Bluetooth/Technology/Technology_Transfer/ Bluetooth.com]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usb.org/press/WiMedia_Tech_Transfer/ |title=USB.org |publisher=USB.org |date=16 March 2009 |accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incisor.tv/2009/03/what-to-make-of-bluetooth-sig-wimedia.html |title=Incisor.tv |publisher=Incisor.tv |date=16 March 2009 |accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009 the [[Bluetooth Special Interest Group]] suspended development of UWB as part of the alternative MAC/PHY, Bluetooth v3.0 + HS solution. A small, but significant, number of former [[WiMedia Alliance|WiMedia]] members had not and would not sign up to the necessary agreements for the [[intellectual property|IP]] transfer. The Bluetooth SIG is now in the process of evaluating other options for its longer term roadmap.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=J5E0PN3NQ5BNLQE1GHPSKH4ATMY32JVN?articleID=221100170 Bluetooth group drops ultrawideband, eyes 60 GHz], [http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml;jsessionid=J5E0PN3NQ5BNLQE1GHPSKH4ATMY32JVN?articleID=217201265 Report: Ultrawideband dies by 2013], [http://www.incisor.tv/download.php?file=140november2009.pdf Incisor Magazine November 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{Anchor|v4.0}}Bluetooth v4.0===
{{See also|Bluetooth low energy}}

The Bluetooth SIG completed the Bluetooth Core Specification version 4.0 (called Bluetooth Smart) and has been adopted as of 30 June 2010. It includes ''Classic Bluetooth'', ''Bluetooth high speed'' and ''[[Bluetooth low energy]]'' protocols. Bluetooth high speed is based on Wi-Fi, and Classic Bluetooth consists of legacy Bluetooth protocols.

[[Bluetooth low energy]], previously known as Wibree,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.wibree.com/press/Wibree_pressrelease_final_1206.pdf |title=Wibree forum merges with Bluetooth SIG |date=12 June 2007 |publisher=Nokia |format=PDF |accessdate=4 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a subset of Bluetooth v4.0 with an entirely new protocol stack for rapid build-up of simple links. As an alternative to the Bluetooth standard protocols that were introduced in Bluetooth v1.0 to v3.0, it is aimed at very low power applications running off a [[Button cell|coin cell]]. Chip designs allow for two types of implementation, dual-mode, single-mode and enhanced past versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluetooth.com/Bluetooth/Press/SIG/SIG_INTRODUCES_BLUETOOTH_LOW_ENERGY_WIRELESS_TECHNOLOGY_THE_NEXT_GENERATION_OF_BLUETOOTH_WIRELESS_TE.htm |title=Bluetooth.com |publisher=Bluetooth.com |accessdate=4 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The provisional names ''Wibree'' and ''Bluetooth ULP'' (Ultra Low Power) were abandoned and the BLE name was used for a while. In late 2011, new logos “Bluetooth Smart Ready” for hosts and “Bluetooth Smart” for sensors were introduced as the general-public face of BLE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/25/bluetooth-sig-unveils-smart-marks-explains-v4-0-compatibility-w/ |title=Bluetooth SIG unveils Smart Marks, explains v4.0 compatibility with unnecessary complexity |publisher=Engadget }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In a dual-mode implementation, Bluetooth Smart functionality is integrated into an existing Classic Bluetooth controller. {{As of|2011|03}}, the following semiconductor companies have announced the availability of chips meeting the standard: [[Qualcomm Atheros|Qualcomm-Atheros]], [[CSR plc|CSR]], [[Broadcom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook-Air-13-Inch-Mid-2011-Teardown/6130/1 |title=iFixit MacBook Air 13&quot; Mid 2011 Teardown |publisher=iFixit.com|accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcom.com/products/Bluetooth/Bluetooth-RF-Silicon-and-Software-Solutions/BCM20702 |title=Broadcom.com&amp;nbsp;– BCM20702&amp;nbsp;– Single-Chip Bluetooth® 4.0 HCI Solution with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Support |publisher=Broadcom |accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Texas Instruments]]. The compliant architecture shares all of Classic Bluetooth’s existing radio and functionality resulting in a negligible cost increase compared to Classic Bluetooth.

Cost-reduced single-mode chips, which enable highly integrated and compact devices, feature a lightweight Link Layer providing ultra-low power idle mode operation, simple device discovery, and reliable point-to-multipoint data transfer with advanced power-save and secure encrypted connections at the lowest possible cost.

General improvements in version 4.0 include the changes necessary to facilitate BLE modes, as well the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) and Security Manager (SM) services with [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]] Encryption.

Core Specification Addendum 2 was unveiled in December 2011; it contains improvements to the audio Host Controller Interface and to the High Speed (802.11) Protocol Adaptation Layer.

Core Specification Addendum 3 revision 2 has an adoption date of 24 July 2012.

Core Specification Addendum 4 has an adoption date of 12 February 2013.

==={{Anchor|v4.1}}Bluetooth v4.1===
The Bluetooth SIG announced formal adoption of the Bluetooth 4.1 specification on 4 December 2013. This specification is an incremental software update to Bluetooth Specification v4.0 and not a hardware update.

* Makes Bluetooth Smart even smarter with industry-leading privacy, power efficiency and industry standard security
* Makes Bluetooth Smart even faster with throughput speed and packet capacity increases

==Technical information==

===Bluetooth protocol stack===
{{Main|Bluetooth stack|Bluetooth protocols}}
[[File:Bluetooth protokoly.svg|thumb|250px|right|Bluetooth Protocol Stack]]
Bluetooth is defined as a layer protocol architecture consisting of core protocols, cable replacement protocols, telephony control protocols, and adopted protocols.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;Stallings, William. (2005). ''Wireless communications &amp; networks.'=' Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall.''&lt;/ref&gt; Mandatory protocols for all Bluetooth stacks are: LMP, L2CAP and SDP. In addition, devices that communicate with Bluetooth almost universally can use these protocols: [[Bluetooth protocols#Host/controller interface (HCI)|HCI]] and RFCOMM.

====LMP====
The ''Link Management Protocol'' (LMP) is used for set-up and control of the radio link between two devices. Implemented on the controller.

====L2CAP====
The ''Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol'' (L2CAP) Used to multiplex multiple logical connections between two devices using different higher level protocols.
Provides segmentation and reassembly of on-air packets.

In ''Basic'' mode, L2CAP provides packets with a payload configurable up to 64&amp;nbsp;kB, with 672 bytes as the default [[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]], and 48 bytes as the minimum mandatory supported MTU.

In ''Retransmission and Flow Control'' modes, L2CAP can be configured either for isochronous data or reliable data per channel by performing retransmissions and CRC checks.

Bluetooth Core Specification Addendum 1 adds two additional L2CAP modes to the core specification. These modes effectively deprecate original Retransmission and Flow Control modes:
* '''Enhanced Retransmission Mode''' (ERTM): This mode is an improved version of the original retransmission mode. This mode provides a reliable L2CAP channel.
* '''Streaming Mode''' (SM): This is a very simple mode, with no retransmission or flow control. This mode provides an unreliable L2CAP channel.

Reliability in any of these modes is optionally and/or additionally guaranteed by the lower layer Bluetooth BDR/EDR air interface by configuring the number of retransmissions and flush timeout (time after which the radio will flush packets). In-order sequencing is guaranteed by the lower layer.

Only L2CAP channels configured in ERTM or SM may be operated over AMP logical links.

====SDP====
The ''Service Discovery Protocol'' (SDP) allows a device to discover services offered by other devices, and their associated parameters. For example, when you use a mobile phone with a Bluetooth headset, the phone uses SDP to determine which [[Bluetooth profile]]s the headset can use (Headset Profile, Hands Free Profile, [[Advanced Audio Distribution Profile|Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP)]] etc.) and the protocol multiplexer settings needed for the phone to connect to the headset using each of them. Each service is identified by a [[Universally Unique Identifier]] (UUID), with official services (Bluetooth profiles) assigned a short form UUID (16 bits rather than the full 128).

====RFCOMM====
''Radio Frequency Communications'' (RFCOMM) is a cable replacement protocol used to generate a virtual serial data stream. RFCOMM provides for binary data transport and emulates [[EIA-232]] (formerly RS-232) control signals over the Bluetooth baseband layer, i.e. it is a serial port emulation.

RFCOMM provides a simple reliable data stream to the user, similar to TCP. It is used directly by many telephony related profiles as a carrier for AT commands, as well as being a transport layer for OBEX over Bluetooth.

Many Bluetooth applications use RFCOMM because of its widespread support and publicly available API on most operating systems. Additionally, applications that used a serial port to communicate can be quickly ported to use RFCOMM.

====BNEP====
The ''Bluetooth Network Encapsulation Protocol'' (BNEP) is used for transferring another protocol stack's data via an L2CAP channel.
Its main purpose is the transmission of IP packets in the Personal Area Networking Profile.
BNEP performs a similar function to [[Subnetwork Access Protocol|SNAP]] in Wireless LAN.

====AVCTP====
The ''Audio/Video Control Transport Protocol'' (AVCTP) is used by the remote control profile to transfer AV/C commands over an L2CAP channel. The music control buttons on a stereo headset use this protocol to control the music player.

====AVDTP====
The ''Audio/Video Distribution Transport Protocol'' (AVDTP) is used by the advanced audio distribution profile to stream music to stereo headsets over an L2CAP channel.
Intended to be used by video distribution profile in the bluetooth transmission.

====TCS====
The ''Telephony Control Protocol&amp;nbsp;– Binary'' (TCS BIN) is the bit-oriented protocol that defines the call control signaling for the establishment of voice and data calls between Bluetooth devices. Additionally, &quot;TCS BIN defines mobility management procedures for handling groups of Bluetooth TCS devices.&quot;

TCS-BIN is only used by the cordless telephony profile, which failed to attract implementers. As such it is only of historical interest.

====Adopted protocols====
Adopted protocols are defined by other standards-making organizations and incorporated into Bluetooth’s protocol stack, allowing Bluetooth to code protocols only when necessary. The adopted protocols include:
*'''[[Point-to-Point Protocol]] (PPP)''': Internet standard protocol for transporting [[IP datagram]]s over a point-to-point link.
*'''[[TCP/IP]]/UDP''': Foundation Protocols for TCP/IP protocol suite
*'''[[OBject EXchange|Object Exchange Protocol]] (OBEX)''': Session-layer protocol for the exchange of objects, providing a model for object and operation representation
*'''[[Wireless Application Protocol|Wireless Application Environment/Wireless Application Protocol]] (WAE/WAP)''': WAE specifies an application framework for wireless devices and WAP is an open standard to provide mobile users access to telephony and information services.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt;

===Baseband error correction===
Depending on packet type, individual packets may be protected by [[error correction]], either 1/3 rate [[forward error correction]] (FEC) or 2/3 rate. In addition, packets with CRC will be retransmitted until acknowledged by [[automatic repeat request]] (ARQ).

===Setting up connections===
Any Bluetooth device in ''discoverable mode'' will transmit the following information on demand:
* Device name
* Device class
* List of services
* Technical information (for example: device features, manufacturer, Bluetooth specification used, clock offset)

Any device may perform an inquiry to find other devices to connect to, and any device can be configured to respond to such inquiries. However, if the device trying to connect knows the address of the device, it always responds to direct connection requests and transmits the information shown in the list above if requested. Use of a device's services may require pairing or acceptance by its owner, but the connection itself can be initiated by any device and held until it goes out of range. Some devices can be connected to only one device at a time, and connecting to them prevents them from connecting to other devices and appearing in inquiries until they disconnect from the other device.

Every device has a unique 48-bit address. However, these addresses are generally not shown in inquiries. Instead, friendly Bluetooth names are used, which can be set by the user. This name appears when another user scans for devices and in lists of paired devices.

Most cellular phones have the Bluetooth name set to the manufacturer and model of the phone by default. Most cellular phones and laptops show only the Bluetooth names and special programs are required to get additional information about remote devices. This can be confusing as, for example, there could be several cellular phones in range named [[Sony Ericsson T610|T610]] (see [[Bluejacking]]).

{{anchor|Pairing}}

===Pairing and bonding===

====Motivation====
Many of the services offered over Bluetooth can expose private data or allow the connecting party to control the Bluetooth device. For security reasons it is necessary to be able to recognize specific devices and thus enable control over which devices are allowed to connect to a given Bluetooth device. At the same time, it is useful for Bluetooth devices to be able to establish a connection without user intervention (for example, as soon as they are in range).

To resolve this conflict, Bluetooth uses a process called ''bonding'', and a bond is generated through a process called ''pairing''. The pairing process is triggered either by a specific request from a user to generate a bond (for example, the user explicitly requests to &quot;Add a Bluetooth device&quot;), or it is triggered automatically when connecting to a service where (for the first time) the identity of a device is required for security purposes. These two cases are referred to as dedicated bonding and general bonding respectively.

Pairing often involves some level of user interaction; this user interaction is the basis for confirming the identity of the devices. Once pairing successfully completes, a bond will have been formed between the two devices, enabling those two devices to connect to each other in the future without requiring the pairing process in order to confirm the identity of the devices. When desired, the bonding relationship can later be removed by the user.

====Implementation====
During the pairing process, the two devices involved establish a relationship by creating a [[shared secret]] known as a ''link key''. If a link key is stored by both devices they are said to be ''paired'' or ''bonded''. A device that wants to communicate only with a bonded device can [[cryptography|cryptographically]] [[authentication|authenticate]] the identity of the other device, and so be sure that it is the same device it previously paired with. Once a link key has been generated, an authenticated [[Asynchronous Connection-Less]] (ACL) link between the devices may be [[encryption|encrypted]] so that the data that they exchange over the airwaves is protected against [[eavesdropping]].

Link keys can be deleted at any time by either device. If done by either device this will implicitly remove the bonding between the devices; so it is possible for one of the devices to have a link key stored but not be aware that it is no longer bonded to the device associated with the given link key.

Bluetooth services generally require either encryption or authentication, and as such require pairing before they allow a remote device to use the given service. Some services, such as the Object Push Profile, elect not to explicitly require authentication or encryption so that pairing does not interfere with the user experience associated with the service use-cases.

====Pairing mechanisms====
Pairing mechanisms have changed significantly with the introduction of Secure Simple Pairing in Bluetooth v2.1. The following summarizes the pairing mechanisms:
* ''Legacy pairing'': This is the only method available in Bluetooth v2.0 and before. Each device must enter a [[Personal identification number|PIN code]]; pairing is only successful if both devices enter the same PIN code. Any 16-byte UTF-8 string may be used as a PIN code; however, not all devices may be capable of entering all possible PIN codes.
** ''Limited input devices'': The obvious example of this class of device is a Bluetooth Hands-free headset, which generally have few inputs. These devices usually have a ''fixed PIN'', for example &quot;0000&quot; or &quot;1234&quot;, that are hard-coded into the device.
** ''Numeric input devices'': Mobile phones are classic examples of these devices. They allow a user to enter a numeric value up to 16 digits in length.
** ''Alpha-numeric input devices'': PCs and smartphones are examples of these devices. They allow a user to enter full UTF-8 text as a PIN code. If pairing with a less capable device the user needs to be aware of the input limitations on the other device, there is no mechanism available for a capable device to determine how it should limit the available input a user may use.
* ''Secure Simple Pairing'' (SSP): This is required by Bluetooth v2.1, although a Bluetooth v2.1 device may only use legacy pairing to interoperate with a v2.0 or earlier device. Secure Simple Pairing uses a form of [[public key cryptography]], and some types can help protect against [[Man-in-the-middle attack|man in the middle]], or MITM attacks. SSP has the following characteristics:
** ''Just works'': As implied by the name, this method just works. No user interaction is required; however, a device may prompt the user to confirm the pairing process. This method is typically used by headsets with very limited IO capabilities, and is more secure than the fixed PIN mechanism which is typically used for legacy pairing by this set of limited devices. This method provides no man in the middle (MITM) protection.
** ''Numeric comparison'': If both devices have a display and at least one can accept a binary Yes/No user input, they may use Numeric Comparison. This method displays a 6-digit numeric code on each device. The user should compare the numbers to ensure they are identical. If the comparison succeeds, the user(s) should confirm pairing on the device(s) that can accept an input. This method provides MITM protection, assuming the user confirms on both devices and actually performs the comparison properly.
** ''Passkey Entry'': This method may be used between a device with a display and a device with numeric keypad entry (such as a keyboard), or two devices with numeric keypad entry. In the first case, the display is used to show a 6-digit numeric code to the user, who then enters the code on the keypad. In the second case, the user of each device enters the same 6-digit number. Both of these cases provide MITM protection.
** ''Out of band'' (OOB): This method uses an external means of communication, such as [[Near Field Communication]] (NFC) to exchange some information used in the pairing process. Pairing is completed using the Bluetooth radio, but requires information from the OOB mechanism. This provides only the level of MITM protection that is present in the OOB mechanism.

SSP is considered simple for the following reasons:
* In most cases, it does not require a user to generate a passkey.
* For use-cases not requiring MITM protection, user interaction can be eliminated.
* For ''numeric comparison'', MITM protection can be achieved with a simple equality comparison by the user.
* Using OOB with NFC enables pairing when devices simply get close, rather than requiring a lengthy discovery process.

====Security concerns====
Prior to Bluetooth v2.1, encryption is not required and can be turned off at any time. Moreover, the encryption key is only good for approximately 23.5 hours; using a single encryption key longer than this time allows simple [[Stream cipher attack|XOR attacks]] to retrieve the encryption key.
* Turning off encryption is required for several normal operations, so it is problematic to detect if encryption is disabled for a valid reason or for a security attack.
Bluetooth v2.1 addresses this in the following ways:
* Encryption is required for all non-SDP (Service Discovery Protocol) connections
* A new Encryption Pause and Resume feature is used for all normal operations requiring encryption to be disabled. This enables easy identification of normal operation from security attacks.
* The encryption key is required to be refreshed before it expires.
Link keys may be stored on the device file system, not on the Bluetooth chip itself. Many Bluetooth chip manufacturers allow link keys to be stored on the device; however, if the device is removable this means that the link key will move with the device.

===Air interface===
The [[protocol (computing)|protocol]] operates in the license-free [[ISM band]] at 2.402–2.480&amp;nbsp;[[GHz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;D. Chomienne, M. Eftimakis&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|title=Bluetooth Tutorial
|format=PDF
|date=20 October 2010
|accessdate=11 December 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
To avoid interfering with other protocols that use the 2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz band, the Bluetooth protocol divides the band into 79&amp;nbsp;channels (each 1&amp;nbsp;MHz wide) and changes channels, generally 1600 times per second. Implementations with versions 1.1 and 1.2 reach speeds of 723.1&amp;nbsp;[[kilobit per second|kbit/s]]. Version 2.0 implementations feature Bluetooth Enhanced Data Rate (EDR) and reach 2.1&amp;nbsp;[[Mbit/s]]; this comes with a concomitant higher power consumption. In some cases, the higher data rate is expected to offset this increased drain.

===Overview===
{{see also|Mobile security#Attacks based on communication networks}}
Bluetooth implements [[confidentiality]], [[authentication]] and [[key (cryptography)|key]] derivation with custom algorithms based on the [[SAFER|SAFER+]] [[block cipher]]. Bluetooth key generation is generally based on a Bluetooth PIN, which must be entered into both devices. This procedure might be modified if one of the devices has a fixed PIN (e.g., for headsets or similar devices with a restricted user interface). During pairing, an initialization key or master key is generated, using the E22 algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[E0 (cipher)|E0]] stream cipher is used for encrypting packets, granting confidentiality, and is based on a shared cryptographic secret, namely a previously generated link key or master key. Those keys, used for subsequent encryption of data sent via the air interface, rely on the Bluetooth PIN, which has been entered into one or both devices.

In September 2008, the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) published a Guide to Bluetooth Security that will serve as reference to organizations on the security capabilities of Bluetooth and steps for securing Bluetooth technologies effectively. While Bluetooth has its benefits, it is susceptible to denial-of-service attacks, eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, message modification, and resource misappropriation. Users/organizations must evaluate their acceptable level of risk and incorporate security into the lifecycle of Bluetooth devices. To help mitigate risks, included in the NIST document are security checklists with guidelines and recommendations for creating and maintaining secure Bluetooth piconets, headsets, and smart card readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Bluetooth v2.1&amp;nbsp;– finalized in 2007 with consumer devices first appearing in 2009&amp;nbsp;– makes significant changes to Bluetooth's security, including pairing. See the [[#Pairing mechanisms|pairing mechanisms]] section for more about these changes.

===Bluejacking===
{{main|Bluejacking}}
Bluejacking is the sending of either a picture or a message from one user to an unsuspecting user through'' Bluetooth'' wireless technology. Common applications include short messages, ''e.g.'', &quot;You've just been bluejacked!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Security advances have alleviated this issue.

===History of security concerns===

====2001–2004====
In 2001, Jakobsson and Wetzel from [[Bell Laboratories]] discovered flaws in the Bluetooth pairing protocol and also pointed to vulnerabilities in the encryption scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A new attack called [[Bluebugging|BlueBug]] was used for this experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=1 February 2007
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The virus was first described by [[Kaspersky Lab]] and requires users to confirm the installation of unknown software before it can propagate. The virus was written as a proof-of-concept by a group of virus writers known as &quot;29A&quot; and sent to anti-virus groups. Thus, it should be regarded as a potential (but not real) security threat to Bluetooth technology or [[Symbian OS]] since the virus has never spread outside of this system. In August 2004, a world-record-setting experiment (see also [[Bluetooth sniping]]) showed that the range of Class&amp;nbsp;2 Bluetooth radios could be extended to {{convert|1.78|km|mi|abbr=on}} with directional antennas and signal amplifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

This poses a potential security threat because it enables attackers to access vulnerable Bluetooth devices from a distance beyond expectation. The attacker must also be able to receive information from the victim to set up a connection. No attack can be made against a Bluetooth device unless the attacker knows its Bluetooth address and which channels to transmit on, although these can be deduced within a few minutes if the device is in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====2005====
In January 2005, a mobile [[malware]] worm known as Lasco.A began targeting mobile phones using [[Symbian OS]] ([[S60 (software platform)|Series 60 platform]]) using Bluetooth enabled devices to replicate itself and spread to other devices. The worm is self-installing and begins once the mobile user approves the transfer of the file (velasco.sis) from another device. Once installed, the worm begins looking for other Bluetooth enabled devices to infect. Additionally, the worm infects other [[.SIS]]&amp;nbsp;files on the device, allowing replication to another device through use of removable media ([[Secure Digital]], [[Compact Flash]], etc.). The worm can render the mobile device unstable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In April 2005, [[Cambridge University]] security researchers published results of their actual implementation of passive attacks against the [[Personal identification number|PIN-based]] pairing between commercial Bluetooth devices, confirming the attacks to be practicably fast and the Bluetooth symmetric key establishment method to be vulnerable. To rectify this vulnerability, they carried out an implementation which showed that stronger, asymmetric key establishment is feasible for certain classes of devices, such as mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In June 2005, [http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~shakedy Yaniv Shaked] and [http://www.eng.tau.ac.il/~yash/ Avishai Wool] published a paper describing both passive and active methods for obtaining the PIN for a Bluetooth link. The passive attack allows a suitably equipped attacker to eavesdrop on communications and spoof, if the attacker was present at the time of initial pairing. The active method makes use of a specially constructed message that must be inserted at a specific point in the protocol, to make the master and slave repeat the pairing process. After that, the first method can be used to crack the PIN. This attack's major weakness is that it requires the user of the devices under attack to re-enter the PIN during the attack when the device prompts them to. Also, this active attack probably requires custom hardware, since most commercially available Bluetooth devices are not capable of the timing necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Health concerns==
{{Main|Wireless electronic devices and health}}

Bluetooth uses the [[microwave]] [[radio frequency]] spectrum in the 2.402&amp;nbsp;GHz to 2.480&amp;nbsp;GHz range.&lt;ref name=&quot;D. Chomienne, M. Eftimakis&quot; /&gt;  Maximum power output from a Bluetooth radio is 100&amp;nbsp;[[Milliwatt#Multiples|mW]] for class 1, 2.5&amp;nbsp;mW for class 2, and 1&amp;nbsp;mW for class 3 devices.

== Interference caused by USB 3.0 ==
[[USB 3.0]] devices, ports and cables have been proven to interfere with Bluetooth devices due to the electronic noise they release falling over the same operating band as Bluetooth.  The close proximity of Bluetooth and USB 3.0 devices can result in a drop in throughput or complete connection loss of the Bluetooth device/s connected to a computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.usb.org/developers/whitepapers/327216.pdf | title = USB 3.0* Radio Frequency Interference Impact on 2.4 GHz Wireless Devices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various strategies can be applied to resolve the problem, ranging from simple solutions such as increasing the distance of USB 3.0 devices from any Bluetooth devices or purchasing better shielded USB cables. Other solutions include applying additional shielding to the internal Bluetooth components of a computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.bluetoothandusb3.com | title = A guide to resolving Bluetooth and USB 3.0 interference issues}}&lt;/ref&gt;
