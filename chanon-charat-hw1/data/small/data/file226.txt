'''Anime'''{{Nihongo|&lt;!--'''Anime'''--&gt;|アニメ||{{IPA-ja|anʲime||Anime.ogg}}}};  are [[Japan]]ese [[animation|animated]] productions featuring hand-drawn or computer animation.

The earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917, and production of anime works in Japan has since continued to increase steadily. The characteristic anime art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of [[Osamu Tezuka]] and spread internationally in the late twentieth century, developing a large domestic and international audience. Anime is distributed theatrically, by television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the internet and is classified into numerous genres targeting diverse broad and niche audiences.

Anime is a diverse art form with distinctive production methods and techniques that have been adapted over time in response to emergent technologies. The production of anime focuses less on the animation of movement and more on the realism of settings as well as the use of camera effects, including panning, zooming and angle shots. Diverse art styles are used and character proportions and features can be quite varied, including characteristically large emotive or realistically sized eyes.

The anime industry consists of over 430 production studios including major names like [[Studio Ghibli]], [[Gainax]] and [[Toei Animation]]. Despite having a fraction of the domestic film market, anime achieves a majority of DVD sales and has been an international success after the rise of televised English [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]]s. This rise in international popularly has resulted in non-Japanese productions using the anime art style, but these works have been defined as [[anime-influenced animation]] by both fans and the industry.

== Definition and usage ==
Anime is an art form, specifically animation, that includes all [[genre]]s found in cinema, but it can be mistakenly classified as a genre.&lt;ref name=&quot;ae&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Anime Essentials: Every Thing a Fan Needs to Know | publisher=Stone Bridge Press | author=Poitras, Gilles | year=2000 | pages=7–115 | isbn=978-1-880656-53-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} In Japan, the term ''anime'' refers to all forms of animation from around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;japanese&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/__data/page/9842/Tezuka_Kit_1.pdf |format=PDF |title=Tezuka: The Marvel of Manga - Education Kit |year=2007 |publisher=Art Gallery New South Wales |accessdate=October 28, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070830033821/http://artgallery.nsw.gov.au/__data/page/9842/Tezuka_Kit_1.pdf &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archivedate = August 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; English-language dictionaries define ''anime'' as a &quot;Japanese-style animated film or television entertainment&quot; or as &quot;a style of animation created in Japan&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;webster&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/248729?rskey=NwstkV&amp;result=3&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid |title=Anime |publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |accessdate=August 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The etymology of the word ''anime'' is disputed. The English term &quot;animation&quot; is written in Japanese ''[[katakana]]'' as アニメーション (''animēshon'', pronounced {{IPA-ja|animeːɕoɴ|}}),&lt;ref name=anna /&gt; and is  アニメ (anime) in its shortened form.&lt;ref name=anna /&gt; Some sources claim that ''anime'' derives from the French term for animation, ''dessin animé'',&lt;ref name=&quot;etymology&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;manga!&quot;/&gt; but others believe this to be a myth derived from the French popularity of the medium in the late 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=anna/&gt; In English, ''anime'', when used as a common [[noun]], normally functions as a [[mass noun]] (for example: &quot;Do you watch anime?&quot;, &quot;How much anime have you collected?&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[[American Heritage Dictionary]], 4th ed.; Dictionary.com Unabridged (v 1.1).&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the widespread use of ''anime'', the term ''Japanimation'' was prevalent throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In the mid-1980s, the term ''anime'' began to supplant Japanimation.&lt;ref name=&quot;etymology&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=anime |title=Etymology Dictionary Reference: Anime |accessdate=April 22, 2013 |work=Etymonline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bookref2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Patten |first=Fred |title=Watching Anime, Reading Manga: 25 Years of Essays and Reviews |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |year=2004 |isbn=1-880656-92-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the term now only appears in period works where it is used to distinguish and identify Japanese animation.&lt;ref name=&quot;bookref2&quot; /&gt;

In 1987, [[Hayao Miyazaki]] stated that he despised the truncated word &quot;Anime&quot; because to him it represented the desolation of the Japanese animation industry. He equated the desolation  with animators lacking motivation and mass-produced, overly expressive products which rely on fixed iconography for facial expressions and protracted and exaggerated action scenes but lack depth and sophistication because they do not attempt to convey emotion or thought.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miyazaki(2009)&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Miyazaki |first=Hayao |date=July 31, 1996 |chapter= 日本のアニメーションについて |trans_chapter= Thoughts on Japanese Animation |title=出発点 1979~1996|trans_title=Starting Point 1979~1996 |url=http://www.viz.com/books/print/starting-point-1979-1996-volume-1/5855 |location=San Francisco |publisher=Viz Media |pages=72ff | isbn=978-1-4215-0594-7 |accessdate= December 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first format of anime was theatrical viewing which originally began with commercial productions in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;Litten&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://litten.de/fulltext/ani1917.pdf | title=Some remarks on the first Japanese animation films in 1917 | publisher=Litten, Frank | accessdate=July 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the animated flips were crude and required played musical components before adding sound and vocal components to the production.

The home distribution of anime releases were popularized in the 1980s with the [[VHS]] and [[Laser Disc]] formats.&lt;ref name=ae /&gt;{{rp|14}} The VHS [[NTSC]] video format used in both Japan and the United States is credited as aiding the rising popularity of anime in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=ae /&gt;{{rp|14}} The Laser Disc and VHS formats were transcended by the [[DVD]] format which offered the unique advantages; including multiple subtitling and dubbing tracks on the same disc.&lt;ref name=ae /&gt;{{rp|15}} The DVD format also has its drawbacks in the its usage of [[DVD region code|region coding]]; adopted by the industry to solve licensing, piracy and export problems and restricted region indicated on the DVD player.&lt;ref name=ae /&gt;{{rp|15}} The [[Video CD]] (VCD) format was popular in Hong Kong and Taiwan, but became only a minor format in the United States that was closely associated with [[counterfeit|bootleg]] copies.&lt;ref name=ae /&gt;{{rp|15}}

[[File:Anime cell 1917.jpg|thumb|left|A cel from the earliest surviving Japanese animated short, produced in 1917]]

Anime arose in the early 20th century, when Japanese [[Film director|filmmakers]] experimented with the [[animation]] techniques also pioneered in France, Germany, the United States and Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;manga!&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Schodt |first=Frederik L. | title=Manga!

Animators such as [[Ōten Shimokawa]] and [[Seitarou Kitayama]] produced numerous works, with the oldest surviving film being Kouchi's ''[[Namakura Gatana]]'', a two-minute clip of a samurai trying to test a new sword on his target only to suffer defeat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Litten&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://imprinttalk.com/?p=1557 |title=Japan's oldest animation films |journal=ImprintTALK |date=March 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hdrjapan.com/japan/japan-news/historic-91%11year%11old-anime-discovered-in-osaka/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080402012234/http://www.hdrjapan.com/japan/japan-news/historic-91%11year%11old-anime-discovered-in-osaka/ |archivedate=April 2, 2008 |title=Historic 91-year-old anime discovered in Osaka |publisher=HDR Japan |date=March 30, 2008 |accessdate=May 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]] resulted in widespread destruction to Japan's infrastructure and the destruction of Shimokawa's warehouse, destroying most of these early works.

By the 1930s animation was well established in Japan as an alternative format to the [[live-action]] industry. It suffered competition from foreign producers and many animators, such as [[Noburō Ōfuji]] and [[Yasuji Murata]], who still worked in cheaper [[cutout animation]] rather than [[cel animation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midnighteye.com/features/pioneers-of-anime.shtml|title=Pioneers of Japanese Animation (Part 1)|last=Sharp|first=Jasper|date=September 23, 2004|publisher=Midnight Eye|accessdate=December 11, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100117151328/http://www.midnighteye.com/features/pioneers-of-anime.shtml| archivedate= January 17, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other creators, such as [[Kenzō Masaoka]] and [[Mitsuyo Seo]], nonetheless made great strides in animation technique; they benefited from the patronage of the government, which employed animators to produce educational shorts and [[Japanese propaganda during World War II|propaganda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yamaguchi|first=Katsunori|author2=Yasushi Watanabe|title=Nihon animēshon eigashi|publisher=Yūbunsha|year=1977|pages=26–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[talkie]] anime was ''[[Chikara to Onna no Yo no Naka]]'', produced by Masaoka in 1933.&lt;ref name=&quot;animeguide&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Anime: A Guide to Japanese Animation (1958–1988) |last=Baricordi |first=Andrea |author2=de Giovanni, Massimiliano|author3= Pietroni, Andrea|author4= Rossi, Barbara|author5= Tunesi, Sabrina |date = December 2000|publisher=[[Protoculture Inc.]] |location=[[Montreal, Quebec]], Canada |isbn=2-9805759-0-9 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kodanasha1993&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Japan: An Illustrated Encyclopedia |year=1993 |publisher=[[Kodansha]] |location=Tokyo, Japan |isbn=978-4-06-206489-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1940, numerous anime artists' organizations had risen, including the Shin Mangaha Shudan and Shin Nippon Mangaka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animestatic.com/articles/what-is-anime/|title=What is Anime?|publisher=AnimeStatic|accessdate=November 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first feature length animated film was ''[[Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors]]'' directed by Seo in 1944 with sponsorship by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;Official booklet, ''The Roots of Japanese Anime'', DVD, Zakka Films, 2009.

[[File:Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors-screeny.JPG|thumb|A frame from ''[[Momotaro's Divine Sea Warriors]]'' (1944), the first [[feature-length]] anime film]]

The success of [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s 1937 feature film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' profoundly influenced many Japanese animators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.corneredangel.com/amwess/papers/history.html |title=A Brief History of Anime |year=1999 |accessdate=September 11, 2007 |work=Michael O'Connell, Otakon 1999 Program Book| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070824124913/http://www.corneredangel.com/amwess/papers/history.html| archivedate= August 24, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, manga artist and animator [[Osamu Tezuka]] adapted and simplified many Disney animation techniques to reduce costs and to limit the number of frames in productions. He intended this as a temporary measure to allow him to produce material on a tight schedule with inexperienced animation staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/evans/his135/Events/Anime62/Anime62.html|title=The History of Anime &amp; Manga |last=Zagzoug|first=Marwa|date=April 2001|publisher=Northern Virginia Community College|accessdate=November 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Three Tales (anime)|Three Tales]]'', aired in 1960, was the first anime shown on television. The first anime television series was ''[[Otogi Manga Calendar]]'', aired from 1961 to 1964.

The 1970s saw a surge of growth in the popularity of ''[[manga]]'', Japanese [[comics|comic books]] and [[graphic novel]]s, many of which were later animated. The work of Osamu Tezuka drew particular attention: he has been called a &quot;legend&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200605110157.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060520053910/http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200605110157.html |archivedate=May 20, 2006 |title=5 missing manga pieces by Osamu Tezuka found in U.S|accessdate=August 29, 2006 |last=Ohara |first=Atsushi |publisher=[[Asahi Shimbun]] |date=May 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the &quot;god of manga&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abcb.com/ency/t/tezuka_osamu.htm |title=Dr. Osamu Tezuka |accessdate=August 29, 2006 |date=March 14, 2000 |work=The Anime Encyclopedia |publisher=The Anime Café| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060823180357/http://abcb.com/ency/t/tezuka_osamu.htm| archivedate= August 23, 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paulgravett.com/articles/006_tezuka/006_tezuka.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071231013227/http://www.paulgravett.com/articles/006_tezuka/006_tezuka.htm |archivedate=December 31, 2007 |title=Osamu Tezuka: The God of Manga |accessdate=August 29, 2006 |last=Gravett |first=Paul |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work – and that of other pioneers in the field – inspired characteristics and genres that remain fundamental elements of anime today. The giant [[robot]] genre (known as &quot;[[mecha]]&quot; outside Japan), for instance, took shape under Tezuka, developed into the [[Super Robot]] genre under [[Go Nagai]] and others, and was revolutionized at the end of the decade by [[Yoshiyuki Tomino]] who developed the [[Real Robot]] genre. Robot anime like the ''[[Gundam]]'' and ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]'' series became instant classics in the 1980s, and the robot genre of anime is still one of the most common in Japan and worldwide today. In the 1980s, anime became more accepted in the [[Mainstream (terminology)|mainstream]] in Japan (although less than [[manga]]), and experienced a boom in production. Following a few successful adaptations of anime in overseas markets in the 1980s, anime gained increased acceptance in those markets in the 1990s and even more at the turn of the 21st century. In 2002, ''[[Spirited Away]]'', a [[Studio Ghibli]] production directed by [[Hayao Miyazaki]] won the [[Golden Bear]] at the [[Berlin International Film Festival]] and in 2003 at the [[75th Academy Awards]] it won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]]. {{-}}

== Genres ==
Anime are often classified by target demographic, including ''[[Children's anime and manga|kodomo]]'' (children's), ''[[shōjo]]'' (girls'), ''[[shounen]]'' (boys') and a diverse range of genres targeting an adult audience. Shoujo and shounen anime sometimes contain elements popular with children of both sexes in an attempt to gain crossover appeal. Adult anime may feature a slower pace or greater plot complexity that younger audiences typically find unappealing, as well as adult themes and situations.{{rp|44–48}} A subset of adult anime works feature pornographic elements and are labeled &quot;R18&quot; in Japan, but internationally these works are grouped together under the term ''[[hentai]]'' (Japanese for &quot;pervert&quot;). By contrast, a variety of anime subgenres across demographic groups incorporate ''[[ecchi]]'', sexual themes or undertones without depictions of [[sexual intercourse]], as typified in the comedic or [[Harem (genre)|harem]] genres; due to its popularity among adolescent and adult anime enthusiasts, incorporation of ecchi elements in anime is considered a form of [[fan service]].&lt;ref name=&quot;askjohn&quot;&gt;Ask John: [http://www.animenation.net/blog/2005/05/20/ask-john-why-do-americans-hate-harem-anime/ Why Do Americans Hate Harem Anime?]. animenation.net.

Genres have emerged that explore homosexual romances. While originally pornographic in terminology, ''[[yaoi]]'' (male homosexuality) and ''[[yuri (genre)|yuri]]'' (female homosexuality) are broad terms used internationally to describe any focus on the themes or development of romantic homosexual relationships. Prior to 2000, homosexual characters were typically used for comedic effect, but some works portrayed these characters seriously or sympathetically.&lt;ref name=ae /&gt;{{rp|50}}

== Attributes ==
[[File:Modernanime.jpg|thumb|300px|Anime artists employ many distinct visual styles]]

Anime differs greatly from other forms of animation by its diverse art styles, methods of animation, its production, and its process. Visually, anime is a diverse art form that contains a wide variety of art styles, differing from one creator, artist, and studio.  While no one art style predominates anime as a whole, they do share some similar attributes in terms of animation technique and character design.  Any other visual variation falls under the artists as they see fit.

=== Animation technique ===
Anime follows the typical production of [[animation]], including [[storyboard]]ing, [[voice acting]], [[Character creation|character design]], and [[cel animation|cel production]]. Since the 1990s, animators have increasingly used [[computer animation]] to improve the efficiency of the production process. Artists like [[Noburō Ōfuji]] pioneered the earliest anime works, which were experimental and consisted of images drawn on blackboards, [[stop motion]] animation of paper cutouts, and [[silhouette animation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jouvanceau2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cinémathèque2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Tribute to Noburō Ōfuji |work=To the Source of Anime: Japanese Animation |publisher=Cinémathèque québécoise |year=2008 |url=http://www.cinematheque.qc.ca/animation_japonaise.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=July 21, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080819214736/http://www.cinematheque.qc.ca/animation_japonaise.pdf| archivedate= August 19, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cel animation grew in popularity until it came to dominate the medium.

Japanese animation studios were pioneers of many [[limited animation]] techniques, and have given anime a distinct set of conventions. Unlike [[Disney]] animation, where the emphasis is on the movement, anime emphasizes the art quality and let limited animation techniques make up for the lack of time spent on movement. Such techniques are often used not only to meet deadlines but also as artistic devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChicksOnAnimeSep2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/chicks-on-anime/2008-09-16|last1=Dong |first1=Bamboo |last2=Brienza |first2=Casey |last3=Pocock |first3=Sara |last4=Sevakis |first4=Robin |title=Chicks on Anime - Sep 16th 2008 |series=Chicks on Anime |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |date=September 16, 2008 |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anime scenes place emphasis on achieving three-dimensional views, and backgrounds are instrumental in creating the atmosphere of the work.&lt;ref name=&quot;manga!&quot;/&gt; The backgrounds are not always invented and are occasionally based on real locations, as exemplified in ''[[Howl's Moving Castle (film)|Howl's Moving Castle]]'' and ''[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (anime)|The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya]]''.&lt;ref name=dc &gt;{{cite book | title=The Anime Art of Hayao Miyazaki | publisher=McFarland | year=2006 | author=Cavallaro, Dani | pages=157–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rinku.zaq.ne.jp/p_v/haruhi.html |title=Reference pictures to actual places |accessdate=January 25, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070126012418/http://www.rinku.zaq.ne.jp/p_v/haruhi.html| archivedate= January 26, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oppliger stated that anime is one of the rare mediums where putting together an all-star cast usually comes out looking &quot;tremendously impressive&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2012/10/01/ask-john-what-determines-a-shows-animation-quality/ |last=Oppliger |first=John |title=Ask John: What Determines a Show's Animation Quality? |publisher=[[AnimeNation]] |date=October 1, 2012 |accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cinematic effects of anime differentiates itself from the stage plays found in American animation. Anime is cinematically shot as if by camera, including panning, zooming, distance and angle shots to more complex dynamic shots that would be difficult to produce in reality.&lt;ref name=ae /&gt;{{rp|58}}&lt;ref name=&quot;production&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huitula.com/productionIG2_page2.htm|title=Anime production process - feature film|year=2000|accessdate=August 27, 2007|work=PRODUCTION I.G| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070815101432/http://www.huitula.com/productionIG2_page2.htm| archivedate= August 15, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.understandinganime.com/cinematography.php |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080613154025/http://www.understandinganime.com/cinematography.php |archivedate=June 13, 2008 |title=Cinematography: Looping and Animetion Techniques |year=1999 |accessdate=August 29, 2007 |work=Understanding Anime}}&lt;/ref&gt; In anime, the animation is produced before the voice acting, contrary to American animation which does the voice acting first; this can cause [[lip sync]] errors in the Japanese version.&lt;ref name=ae /&gt;{{rp|59}}

=== Characters ===
Body proportions of human anime characters tend to accurately reflect the proportions of the human body in reality. The height of the head is considered by the artist as the base unit of proportion. Head heights can vary, but most anime characters are about seven to eight heads tall.&lt;ref name=&quot;headheight&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://animeworld.com/howtodraw/bodies1.html |title=Body Proportion |accessdate=August 16, 2007 |work=Akemi's Anime World| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070805152410/http://animeworld.com/howtodraw/bodies1.html| archivedate= August 5, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anime artists occasionally make deliberate modifications to body proportions to produce [[super deformed]] characters that feature a disproportionately small body compared to the head; many super deformed characters are two to four heads tall. Some anime works like ''[[Crayon Shin-chan]]'' completely disregard these proportions, such that they resemble Western cartoons.

A common anime character design convention is exaggerated eye size. The animation of characters with large eyes in anime can be traced back to Osamu Tezuka, who was deeply influenced by such early animation characters as [[Betty Boop]], who was drawn with disproportionately large eyes. Tezuka is a central figure in anime and manga history, whose iconic art style and character designs allowed for the entire range of human emotions to be depicted solely through the eyes.&lt;ref name=ae /&gt;{{rp|60}} The artist adds variable color shading to the eyes and particularly to the cornea to give them greater depth. Generally, a mixture of a light shade, the tone color, and a dark shade is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biorust.com/tutorials/detail/141/en/ |title=Basic Anime Eye Tutorial |accessdate=August 22, 2007 |work=Centi, Biorust.com| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070824072700/http://biorust.com/tutorials/detail/141/en/| archivedate= August 24, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyJ9yfYl_Fc |title=How to color anime eye |date=June 6, 2007 |accessdate=August 22, 2007 |author=Carlus |publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural anthropologist [[Matt Thorn]] argues that Japanese animators and audiences do not perceive such stylized eyes as inherently more or less foreign.&lt;ref name=&quot;manga characters look white&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Do Manga Characters Look &quot;White&quot;? |url=http://www.matt-thorn.com/mangagaku/faceoftheother.html |accessdate=December 11, 2005 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110717060459/http://www.matt-thorn.com/mangagaku/faceoftheother.html &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |archivedate=July 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all anime have large eyes. For example, the works of [[Hayao Miyazaki]] are known for having realistically proportioned eyes, as well as realistic hair colors on their characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;companion&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Poitras |first=Gilles |title=Anime Companion |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |year=1998 |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=1-880656-32-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manga emotions-EN.jpg|thumb|Anime and manga artists often draw from a defined set of facial expressions to depict particular emotions]]

Hair in anime is often unnaturally lively and colorful or uniquely styled. The movement of hair in anime is exaggerated and &quot;hair action&quot; is used to emphasize the action and emotions of characters for added visual effect.&lt;ref name=ae /&gt;{{rp|62}} Poitras traces hairstyle color to cover illustrations on manga, where eye-catching artwork and colorful tones are attractive for children's manga.&lt;ref name=ae /&gt;{{rp|61}} Despite being produced for a domestic market, anime features characters whose race or nationality is not always defined, and this is often a deliberate decision, such as in the ''[[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon]]'' animated series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tobin|first=Joseph Jay|year=2004|title=Pikachu's Global Adventure: The Rise and Fall of Pokémon|publisher=Duke University Press|page=88|isbn=0-8223-3287-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anime and manga artists often draw from a common canon of iconic facial expression illustrations to denote particular moods and thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mangatutorials.com/tut/expressions.php |title=Manga Tutorials: Emotional Expressions |accessdate=August 22, 2008 |work=Rio| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080729175352/http://www.mangatutorials.com/tut/expressions.php| archivedate= July 29, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques are often different in form than their counterparts in Western animation, and they include a fixed [[manga iconography|iconography]] that is used as shorthand for certain emotions and moods.&lt;ref name=&quot;bloody&quot; /&gt; These expression are often exaggerated and are typically comedic in nature. For example, a male character may develop a [[nosebleed]] when aroused, stemming from a Japanese [[old wives' tale]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bloody&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umich.edu/~anime/info_emotions.html |title=Emotional Iconography in Animae |author=University of Michigan Animae Project |date=Current |accessdate=August 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of visual symbols are employed, including sweatdrops to depict nervousness, visible blushing for embarrassment, or glowing eyes for an intense glare.&lt;ref name=&quot;ma&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Understanding Manga and Anime | publisher=Libraries Unlimited | author=Brenner, Robin | year=2007 | isbn=978-1-59158-332-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|52}}

===Music===
The opening and credits sequences of most anime television episodes are accompanied by [[J-pop|Japanese pop]] or [[Music of Japan#Rock|rock]] songs, often by reputed bands. They may be written with the series in mind, but are also aimed at the general music market, and therefore often allude only vaguely or not at all to the themes or plot of the series.  Pop and rock songs are also sometimes used as incidental music (&quot;insert songs&quot;) in an episode, often to highlight particularly important scenes.  More often than not, [[background music]] is employed as an added flavor to series either to drive story plot lines or to simply to decorate particular scenes and animated sequences.  Furthermore, some series offer all applied music available in the form of OST, or original soundtracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Original Soundtrack (OST)|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/lexicon.php?id=74|website=Anime News Network|publisher=ANN|accessdate=2014-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry ==
The animation industry consists of more than 430 production companies with some of the major studios including [[Toei Animation]], [[Gainax]], [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]], [[Gonzo (company)|Gonzo]], [[Sunrise (company)|Sunrise]], [[Bones (studio)|Bones]], [[TMS Entertainment]], [[Nippon Animation]], [[Studio Pierrot]] and [[Studio Ghibli]].&lt;ref name=ma /&gt;{{rp|17}} Many of the studios are organized into a [[trade association]], [[The Association of Japanese Animations]]. There is also a [[labor union]] for workers in the industry, the [[Japanese Animation Creators Association]]. Studios will often work together to produce more complex and costly projects, as done with Studio Ghibli's ''[[Spirited Away]]''.&lt;ref name=ma /&gt;{{rp|17}} An anime episode can cost between [[United States dollar|US$]]100,000 and US$300,000 to produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2012-03-05|title= The Anime Economy - Part 1: Let's Make An Anime!|author= Justin Sevakis|date=2012-03-05|accessdate= 2014-01-03|work= [[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, animation accounted for 7% of the Japanese film market, above the 4.6% market share for live-action works.&lt;ref name=ma /&gt;{{rp|17}}  The popularity and success of anime is seen through the profitability of the DVD market, contributing nearly 70% of total sales.&lt;ref name=ma /&gt;{{rp|17}} ''[[Spirited Away]]'' (2001) is the [[List of highest-grossing animated films#Anime|highest-grossing anime film]], with US$274,925,095.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=spiritedaway.htm|title= Spirited Away|accessdate= May 16, 2014|work= [[Box Office Mojo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anime market for the United States was worth approximately $2.74 billion in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-04-15/america-2009-anime-market-pegged-at-us%242.741-billion|title= America's 2009 Anime Market Pegged at US$2.741 Billion|date=April 15, 2011|accessdate= December 29, 2013|work= [[Anime News Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dubbed animation began airing in the United States in 2000 on networks like [[The WB Television Network|The WB]] and [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]].&lt;ref name=ma /&gt;{{rp|18}} In 2005, this resulted in five of the top ten anime titles having previously aired on Cartoon Network.&lt;ref name=ma /&gt;{{rp|18}} As a part of localization, some [[Editing of anime in American distribution|editing]] of cultural references may occur to better follow the references of the non-Japanese culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.salemstate.edu/~poehlkers/Emerson/Pokemon.html |title=Pokemon Case Study |publisher=W3.salemstate.edu |accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of English localization averages US $10,000 per episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2012/02/24/ask-john-why-does-dubbing-cost-so-much/ |last=Oppliger |first=John |title=Ask John: Why Does Dubbing Cost So Much? |publisher=[[AnimeNation]] |date=February 24, 2012 |accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The industry has been subject to both praise and condemnation for [[fansubs]], the addition of unlicensed and unauthorized subtitled translations of anime series or films.&lt;ref name=ma /&gt;{{rp|206}} Fansubs, which were originally distributed on VHS bootlegged cassettes in the 1980s, have been freely available and disseminated online since the 1990s.&lt;ref name=ma /&gt;{{rp|206}} Fansubbers tend to adhere to an unwritten code to destroy or no longer distribute an anime once an official translated or subtitled version becomes licensed, although fansubs typically continue to circulate through file sharing networks.&lt;ref name=ma /&gt;{{rp|207}}

Legal international availability of anime on the internet has changed in recent years, with [[simulcast]]s of series available on websites like [[Crunchyroll]].

=== Awards ===
The anime industry has several annual awards which honor the year's best works. Major annual awards in Japan include the [[Ōfuji Noburō Award]], the [[Mainichi Film Award for Best Animation Film]], the [[Animation Kobe]] Awards, the [[Japan Media Arts Festival]] animation awards, the [[Tokyo Anime Award]] and the [[Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year]]. In the United States, anime films compete in the ICv2.com Anime Awards&lt;ref name=ma /&gt;{{rp|257–258}} There were also the [[American Anime Awards]], which were designed to recognize excellence in anime titles nominated by the industry, and were held only once in 2006.&lt;ref name=ma /&gt;{{rp|258}} Anime productions are also nominated and win awards not exclusively for anime.

== Influence on world culture ==
[[File:Akihabara picture.jpg|thumb|[[Akihabara]] district of Tokyo is the center of ''[[otaku]]'' subculture in Japan.]]

Anime has become commercially profitable in [[Western world|Western countries]], as demonstrated by early commercially successful Western adaptations of anime, such as ''[[Astro Boy (1963 TV series)|Astro Boy]]''. Since the 19th century, many Westerners have expressed a [[Japanophile|particular interest towards Japan]] and anime has dramatically exposed more Westerners to the culture of Japan.

=== Fan response ===
[[Anime club]]s gave rise to [[anime convention]]s in the 1990s with the &quot;anime boom&quot;, a period marked by increased popularity of anime.&lt;ref name=ae /&gt;{{rp|73}} These conventions are dedicated to anime and manga and include elements like [[cosplay]] contests and industry talk panels.&lt;ref name=ma /&gt;{{rp|211}} Cosplay, a [[portmanteau]] for &quot;costume play&quot;, is not unique to anime and has become popular in contests and masquerades at anime conventions.&lt;ref name=ma /&gt;{{rp|214–215}} Japanese culture and words have entered English usage through the popularity of the medium, including ''[[otaku]]'', a derogatory Japanese term commonly used in English to denote a fan of anime and manga.&lt;ref name=ma /&gt;{{rp|195}} Anime enthusiasts have produced [[fan fiction]] and [[fan art]], including computer wallpaper and [[anime music video]]s.&lt;ref name=ma /&gt;{{rp|201–205}}

===Anime style===
As anime itself became increasingly popular, anime styling has been inevitably the subject of both satire and serious creative productions.&lt;ref name=anna /&gt;&lt;ref name=escapist /&gt;  ''[[South Park]]'''s &quot;[[Chinpokomon]]&quot; and &quot;[[Good Times with Weapons]]&quot; episodes, [[Adult Swim]]'s ''[[Perfect Hair Forever]]'', and [[Nickelodeon]]'s ''[[Kappa Mikey]]'' are examples of satirical depictions of Japanese culture and anime. Some works have sparked debate for blurring the lines between satire and serious &quot;anime style&quot; productions, such as the American anime style production ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''.&lt;ref name=escapist /&gt; These anime styled works have become defined as [[anime-influenced animation]], in an attempt to classify all anime styled works of non-Japanese origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;whatisanime&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/editorial/2002-07-26 |title=What is anime? |date=July 26, 2002 |accessdate=August 18, 2007 |work=ANN| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070820052800/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/editorial/2002-07-26| archivedate= August 20, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some creators of these works cite anime as a source of inspiration and like the French production team for ''[[Ōban Star-Racers]]'' moved to Tokyo to collaborate with a Japanese production team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=17924 |title=Aaron McGruder - The Boondocks Interview |accessdate=October 14, 2007 |work=Troy Rogers |publisher=UnderGroundOnline|quote=&quot;We looked at Samurai Champloo and Cowboy Bebop to make this work for black comedy and it would be a remarkable thing.&quot;|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071030033247/http://www.ugo.com/ugo/html/article/?id=17924|archivedate=October 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.g4tv.com/screensavers/features/49962/Ten_Minutes_with_Megas_XLR.html |title=Ten Minutes with &quot;Megas XLR&quot; |date=October 13, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;company&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.savtheworld.com/eng/company.php |title=STW company background summary}}&lt;/ref&gt; When anime is defined as a &quot;style&quot; rather than as a national product it leaves open the possibility of anime being produced in other countries.&lt;ref name=webster /&gt;&lt;ref name=escapist /&gt; A series dubbed as the &quot;Middle East's First Anime Show&quot; is currently in production,&lt;ref name=Torkaizer /&gt; which is currently looking for funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Scott|title=VIDEO: An Updated Look at &quot;Middle East's First Anime&quot;|url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2013/12/26/video-an-updated-look-at-middle-easts-first-anime|website=Crunchyroll|publisher=Crunchyroll|accessdate=2014-08-20|date=2013-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The web-based series ''[[RWBY]]'' is produced using an anime art style and has been declared to be anime.&lt;ref name=rwby /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lazar|first=Shira|title=Roosterteeth Adds Anime RWBY To YouTube Slate (WATCH)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shira-lazar/roosterteeth-adds-anime-r_b_3720316.html|publisher=Huffingtonpost|accessdate=August 15, 2013|date=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the series will be released in Japan, under the label of &quot;anime&quot; per the Japanese definition of the term and referenced as an &quot;American-made anime&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=海外3DCGアニメ『RWBY』吹き替え版BD・DVD販売決定！ コミケで発表|url=http://kai-you.net/article/7931|website=KAI-YOU|accessdate=2014-08-19|date=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Castillo|first1=Michelle|title=American-Made Anime From Rooster Teeth Gets Licensed In Japan|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/american-made-anime-rooster-teeth-gets-licensed-japan-159528|website=AdWeek|publisher=AdWeek|accessdate=2014-08-20|date=2014-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defining anime as style has been contentious amongst fans, with John Oppliger stating, &quot;The insistence on referring to original American art as Japanese &quot;anime&quot; or &quot;manga&quot; robs the work of its cultural identity.&quot;&lt;ref name=anna /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenation.net/blog/2006/05/15/ask-john-how-should-the-word-anime-be-defined/ |title=How should the word ''Anime'' be defined? |date=May 15, 2006 |accessdate=September 26, 2008 |work=AnimeNation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
