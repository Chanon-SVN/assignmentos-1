'''Bletchley Park''', in [[Milton Keynes]], Buckinghamshire, was the central site of the United Kingdom's [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)|Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)]], which during the [[Second World War]] regularly penetrated the secret communications of the [[Axis Powers]]{{snd}}most importantly the German [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] and [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz]] ciphers.
The official historian of World War II British Intelligence has written that the &quot;[[Ultra]]&quot; intelligence produced at Bletchley shortened the war by two to four years, and that without it the outcome of the war would have been uncertain.&lt;ref name=&quot;HinsleyLecture&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hinsley|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The site is now an educational and historical attraction memorialising and celebrating those accomplishments.

== Site ==
[[File:Turing flat.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|The stableyard cottages]]

Fifty miles (80&amp;nbsp;km) northwest of London, the site appears in the [[Domesday Book]] as part of the [[Water Eaton, Milton Keynes|Manor of Eaton]].
[[Browne Willis]] built a mansion there in 1711, but after Thomas Harrison purchased the property in 1793 this was pulled down.
It was first known as Bletchley Park after its purchase by [[Samuel Lipscomb Seckham]] in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morrison|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The estate of {{convert|581|acres|ha}} was bought in 1883 by Sir [[Herbert Samuel Leon]], who expanded the then-existing farmhouse&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation|last=Edward|first=Legg|title=Early History of Bletchley Park 1235{{ndash}}1937|work=Bletchley Park Trust Historic Guides|number=1|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; into the present
&quot;maudlin and monstrous pile&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
{{Harvnb|Morrison&lt;!--quotation is from the title, but likely there's a page# that can be cited?--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
combining [[Victorian Gothic]], [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor]], and [[Dutch Baroque architecture|Dutch Baroque]] styles.

In 1938 the mansion and much of the site was bought by a builder planning a housing estate,
but in May 1938 Admiral Sir [[Hugh Sinclair]], head of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS or [[MI6]]) bought the mansion and {{convert|58|acre|ha}} for use by GC&amp;CS and SIS in the event of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Morrison|pp=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A key advantage seen by Sinclair and his colleagues (inspecting the site under the cover of &quot;Captain Ridley's shooting party&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McKay|2010|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
was Bletchley's geographical centrality.
It was almost immediately adjacent to [[Bletchley railway station]], where the &quot;[[Varsity Line]]&quot; between [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]]{{snd}}whose universities were expected to supply many of the code-breakers{{snd}}met the main [[West Coast Main Line|West Coast railway line]] connecting London, [[Birmingham]], [[Manchester]], [[Liverpool]], [[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]].
[[Watling Street]], the main road linking London to the north-west (now the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]]) was close by, and high-volume communication links were available at the telegraph and telephone repeater station in nearby [[Fenny Stratford]].

Bletchley Park was known as &quot;B.P.&quot; to those who worked there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Briggs|2011|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;Station X&quot;, &quot;London Signals Intelligence Centre&quot;, and &quot;[[Government Communications Headquarters]]&quot; were all cover names used during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Aldrich|2010|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(The formal posting of the many &quot;Wrens&quot;{{snd}}members of the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]]{{snd}}working there was to [[RAF Eastcote|HMS Pembroke V]].)

{{EnigmaSeries}}
Commander [[Alastair Denniston]] was operational head of GC&amp;CS from 1919 to 1942, beginning with its formation from the [[Admiralty]]'s [[Room 40]] (NID25) and the [[War Office]]'s [[MI1]]b.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Erskine|Smith|2011|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Key GC&amp;CS [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalysts]] who moved from London to Bletchley Park included [[John Tiltman]], [[Dilly Knox|Dillwyn &quot;Dilly&quot; Knox]], [[Josh Cooper (cryptographer)|Josh Cooper]], and [[Nigel de Grey]]. These people had a variety of backgrounds{{snd}}linguists, chess champions, and crossword experts were common, and in Knox's case [[papyrology]].

On the day Britain declared war on Germany, Denniston wrote to the [[Foreign Office]] about recruiting &quot;men of the professor type&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budiansky|2000|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Personal networking drove early recruitments, particularly of men from the universities of Cambridge and Oxford. Trustworthy women were similarly recruited for administrative and clerical jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|2004|pp=13{{ndash}}23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one 1941 recruiting stratagem ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' was asked to organise a crossword competition, after which promising contestants were discreetly approached about &quot;a particular type of work as a contribution to the war effort&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = McKay | first = Sinclair | title = Telegraph crossword: Cracking hobby won the day{{snd}}The boffins of Bletchley cut their teeth on the Telegraph crossword | newspaper = The Telegraph | date = 26 Aug 2010 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/wellbeing/7966268/Telegraph-crossword-Cracking-hobby-won-the-day.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joan Clarke]] (eventually deputy head of [[Hut 8]]) was one of the few women employed at Bletchley as a full-fledged cryptanalyst.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burman ref&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Burman|first=Annie|title=Gendering decryption – decrypting gender The gender discourse of labour at Bletchley Park 1939–1945|url=http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:625771/FULLTEXT01.pdf |accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bletchley park ref&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Women Codebreakers |url=http://www.bletchleyparkresearch.co.uk/research-notes/women-codebreakers/ |work=Bletchley Park Research |accessdate=3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This eclectic staff of &quot;[[Boffin]]s and [[Deb (society)|Debs]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|2004|pp=62{{ndash}}71}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused GC&amp;CS to be whimsically dubbed the &quot;Golf, Cheese and Chess Society&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = BBC News UK: Saving Bletchley for the nation | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/358913.stm | accessdate =2 February 2011 | date=2 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the female staff in Dilwyn Knox's section sometimes termed &quot;Dilly's Fillies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McKay|2010|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a September 1941 morale-boosting visit, [[Winston Churchill]] reportedly remarked to Denniston: &quot;I told you to leave no stone unturned to get staff, but I had no idea you had taken me so literally.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kahn1991|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six weeks later, having failed to get sufficient typing and unskilled staff to achieve the productivity that was possible, Turing, Welchman, Alexander and Milner-Barry wrote directly to Churchill. His response was &quot;Action this day make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2004|page=336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After initial training at the Inter-Service Special Intelligence School set up by [[John Tiltman]] (initially at an RAF depot in Buckingham and later in [[Bedford]]{{snd}}where it was known locally as &quot;the Spy School&quot;)&lt;ref name = &quot;Smith89P205-6&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1999|pp=79, 82}}&lt;/ref&gt;
staff worked a six-day week, rotating through three shifts: 4{{nbsp}}p.m. to midnight, midnight to 8{{nbsp}}a.m. (the most disliked shift), and 8{{nbsp}}a.m. to 4{{nbsp}}p.m., each with a half-hour meal break. At the end of the third week a worker went off at 8{{nbsp}}a.m. and came back at 4{{nbsp}}p.m., thus putting in sixteen hours on that last day.&lt;!-- Could we have explicit clarification of the sequence of shifts? Also, how did six-days/week work? Surely the place wasn't idle on Sundays... --&gt; The irregular hours affected workers' health and social life, as well as the routines of the nearby homes at which most staff lodged. The work was tedious and demanded intense concentration; staff got one week's leave four times a year, but some &quot;girls&quot; collapsed and required extended rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McKay|2010|pp=70, 102, 105}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A small number of men (e.g. [[General Post Office|Post Office]] experts in Morse code or German) worked part-time.

In January 1945, at the peak of codebreaking efforts, some 9,000 personnel were working at Bletchley;&lt;ref name = &quot;Smith89P205-6&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1999|pp=205{{ndash}}6}}&lt;/ref&gt; over 12,000 different persons (some 80% of them women, primarily seconded from Britain's armed forces and  Civil Service&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2014|pp=31{{ndash}}32}}&lt;/ref&gt;) were assigned there at various points throughout the war.

==Secrecy==
Properly used, the German Enigma and [[Lorenz cipher]]s should have been virtually unbreakable, but flaws in German cryptographic procedures, and poor discipline among the personnel carrying them out, created vulnerabilities which made Bletchley's attacks just barely feasible.
These vulnerabilities, however, could have been remedied by relatively simple improvements in enemy procedures,&lt;ref name=Milner-Barry1993P92&gt;
{{Harvnb|Milner-Barry|1993|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and such changes would certainly have been implemented had Germany any hint of Bletchley's success.
Thus the intelligence Bletchley produced was considered wartime Britain's &quot;[[Ultra]] secret&quot;{{snd}}higher even than the normally highest classification ''Most {{nobr|Secret''{{thinsp}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hinsley|Stripp|1993|p=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{snd}}}}and security was paramount.
Few outside Bletchley knew its mission, and even fewer (inside or outside) understood the breadth of that mission and the extent of its success.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} All staff signed the [[Official Secrets Act 1939|Official Secrets Act (1939)]] and a 1942 security warning emphasised the importance of discretion even within Bletchley itself: &quot;Do not talk at meals. Do not talk in the transport. Do not talk travelling. Do not talk in the billet. Do not talk by your own fireside. Be careful even in your Hut{{nbsp}}...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|2004|pp=128{{ndash}}9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, any commander in the field receiving Ultra intelligence was fed a cover story crediting a non-Ultra source; at times sham scouting missions{{snd}}intentionally visible to the enemy{{snd}}were dispatched to &quot;discover&quot; German positions in fact already known from Ultra.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}
In some cases it was impossible to act on Ultra intelligence at all because to do so might suggest to the enemy that their communications had been penetrated,{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}{{clarify|date=April 2014}}
though certain claims that the British authorities refused, for this reason, to take steps to protect civilians from imminent harm have been vigorously disputed{{snd}}see, for example, [[Coventry Blitz#Coventry and Ultra|Coventry Blitz]].

==Early work==
[[File:Information Flow Bletchley Park Enigma Messages.png|thumbnail|right|upright=1.6| Flow of information from an intercepted Enigma message&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Sale | first = Tony | author-link = Tony Sale | title = Information flow from German ciphers to Intelligence to Allied commanders. | url = http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/virtualbp/infoflow/infoflowie.htm | accessdate =30 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Turing, Knox, and Jeffreys did their early work{{Clarify|date=April 2014}} in Number 3 Cottage.

The first personnel of the [[Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&amp;CS) moved to Bletchley Park on 15 August 1939.
The Naval, Military, and Air Sections were on the ground floor of the mansion, together with a telephone exchange, teleprinter room, kitchen, and dining room; the top floor was allocated to [[MI6]].
Construction of the wooden huts began,{{when|date=April 2014}} and Elmers School, a neighbouring boarding school, was acquired for the Commercial and Diplomatic Sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1999|pp=2{{ndash}}3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the United States joined the war a number of American cryptographers were posted to [[Hut&amp;nbsp;3]], and from May 1943 onwards there was close co-operation between British and American intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|1993|pp=71, 72}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(See [[1943 BRUSA Agreement]].)
In contrast the [[Soviet Union]] was never officially told of Bletchley Park and its activities{{snd}}
a reflection of Churchill's distrust of the Soviets even during the US-UK-USSR alliance imposed by the Nazi threat.

The only direct enemy damage to the site was done 20{{ndash}}21{{nbsp}}November 1940 by three bombs probably intended for [[Bletchley railway station]]; Hut{{nbsp}}4, shifted two feet off its foundation, was winched back into place as
work inside continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Bletchley Park National Codes Centre | title = The Cafe in Hut{{nbsp}}4 | url = http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content//index.rhtm | accessdate =3 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intelligence reporting==
[[File:Ultra Hut3 Graph.png|thumbnail|upright=1.9| Signals to Commands Abroad{{clarify|reason=What's that mean?|date=April 2014}}
&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bennett|1999|p=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Non-naval Enigma messages were deciphered in [[Hut&amp;nbsp;6]], followed by translation, indexing and cross-referencing, in [[Hut&amp;nbsp;3]].
Only then was it sent out to the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), the intelligence chiefs in the relevant ministries, and later on to high-level commanders in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Calvocoressi|2001|pp=70{{ndash}}81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naval Enigma deciphering was in [[Hut&amp;nbsp;8]], with translation in [[Hut&amp;nbsp;4]].
Verbatim translations were sent only to the [[Naval Intelligence Division]] (NID) of the Admiralty's Operational Intelligence Centre (OIC), supplemented by information from indexes as to the meaning of technical terms and cross-references from a knowledge store of German naval technology.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calvocoressi 2001 29&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Calvocoressi|2001|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hut 4 also decoded a manual system known as the dockyard cipher, which sometimes carried messages that were also sent on an Enigma network.
Feeding these back to Hut{{nbsp}}8 provided excellent &quot;cribs&quot; for [[Known-plaintext attack]]s on the daily naval Enigma key.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Erskine|2011|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Listening stations==

Initially, a [[radio|wireless]] room was established at Bletchley Park.
It was set up in the mansion's water tower under the code name &quot;Station&amp;nbsp;X&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;WatsonP307&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Watson|1993|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; a term now sometimes applied to the codebreaking efforts at Bletchley as a whole.
The &quot;X&quot; is the [[Roman numeral]] &quot;ten&quot;, this being the Secret Intelligence Service's tenth such station.
Due to the long radio aerials stretching from the wireless room, the radio station was moved from Bletchley Park to nearby [[Whaddon, Buckinghamshire#Whaddon Hall|Whaddon Hall]] to avoid drawing attention to the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Butters|2007|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pidgeon|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, other listening stations{{snd}}the [[Y-stations]], such as the ones at [[Chicksands]] in Bedfordshire, [[Beaumanor Hall]], Leicestershire (where the headquarters of the War Office &quot;Y&quot; Group was located) and [[Beeston Hill Y Station]] in Norfolk{{snd}}gathered raw signals for processing at Bletchley.
Coded messages were taken down by hand and sent to Bletchley on paper by motorcycle [[despatch rider]]s or (later) by teleprinter.
Bletchley Park is mainly remembered for breaking the German [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] cypher, but its greatest cryptographic achievement may have been{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} the breaking of the German on-line teleprinter [[Lorenz cipher]] (known at GC&amp;CS as ''Tunny'').

==Additional buildings==
The wartime needs required the building of additional accommodation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Watson| first = Bob | title = Appendix: How the Bletchley Park buildings took shape | pages = 306–310 }} in {{Harvnb|Hinsley|Stripp|1993|pp=149–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hut6.jpg|right|thumb|right|upright=1.0|Hut 6 in 2004]]

Often a hut's number became so strongly associated with the work performed inside that even when the work was moved to another building it was still referred to by the original &quot;Hut&quot; designation.&lt;ref&gt;Some of this information has been derived from [http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/hist/history/RollofHonour.rhtm The Bletchley Park Trust's Roll of Honour].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|Butters|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; are:

==Work on specific countries' signals==

===German signals===
[[Image:bp-polish-codebreakers-plaque.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Bletchley's Polish Memorial, commemorating &quot;the [prewar] work of [[Marian Rejewski]], [[Jerzy Różycki]] and [[Henryk Zygalski]], mathematicians of the [[Biuro Szyfrów|Polish intelligence service]], in first breaking the Enigma code.

Most German messages decrypted at Bletchley were produced by one or another version of the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] cipher machine, but an important minority were produced by the even more complicated twelve-rotor [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz SZ42 on-line teleprinter cipher machine]].

{{see also|Cryptanalysis of the Enigma}}
Five weeks before the outbreak of war, in Warsaw, Poland's [[Biuro Szyfrów|Cipher Bureau]] revealed its achievements in breaking Enigma to astonished French and British personnel.&lt;ref name=Milner-Barry1993P92/&gt; The British used the Poles' information and techniques, and the [[Polish Enigma doubles|Enigma clone]] sent to them in August 1939, which greatly increased their (previously very limited) success in decrypting Enigma messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Twinn|1993|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[bombe]] was an electromech{{shy}}anical device whose function was to discover some of the daily settings of the Enigma machines on the various German military [[Telecommunications network|networks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Budiansky|2000|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sebag-Montefiore|2004|p=375}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Carter | first = Frank | title = From Bombe Stops to Enigma Keys |year = 2004 | publisher = Bletchley Park Codes Centre | url = http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/bombestops.pdf | accessdate =31 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Its pioneering design was developed by [[Alan Turing]] (with an important contribution from Gordon Welchman) and the machine was engineered by [[Harold Keen|Harold 'Doc' Keen]] of the [[British Tabulating Machine Company]].
Each machine was about {{convert|7|ft|m}} high and wide, {{convert|2|ft|m}} deep and weighed about a ton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Ellsbury | first = Graham | title = The Turing Bombe: What it was and how it worked | chapter = 2.

[[Luftwaffe]] messages were the first to be read in quantity.
The German navy had much tighter procedures, and the capture of code books was needed before they could be broken.
When, in February 1942, the German navy introduced the four-rotor Enigma for communications with its Atlantic U-boats, this traffic became unreadable for a period of ten months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2006|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Britain produced modified bombes, but it was the success of the [[Bombe#US Navy Bombe|US Navy bombe]] that was the main source of reading messages from this version of Enigma for the rest of the war.
Messages were sent to and fro across the Atlantic by enciphered teleprinter links.

{{see also|Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher}}[[File:Colossus.jpg|thumbnail|right|upright=1.3|A Mark 2 Colossus computer.
The ten Colossi were the world's first (semi-) programmable electronic computers, the first having been built in 1943]]
The Lorenz messages were codenamed ''Tunny'' at Bletchley Park. They were only sent in quantity from mid-1942. The Tunny networks were used for high-level messages between German High Command and field commanders.
With the help of German operator errors, the cryptanalysts in the [[Testery]] (named after [[Ralph Tester]], its head) worked out the logical structure of the machine despite not knowing its physical form.
They devised automatic machinery to help with decryption, which culminated in [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], the world's first programmable digital electronic computer.
This was designed and built by [[Tommy Flowers]] and his team at the [[Post Office Research Station]] at [[Dollis Hill]].
The first was delivered to Bletchley Park in December 1943 and commissioned the following February.
Enhancements were developed for the Mark 2 Colossus, the first of which was working at Bletchley Park on the morning of [[Normandy landings|D-day]] in June.
Flowers then produced one Colossus a month for the rest of the war, making a total of ten with an eleventh part-built.
The machines were operated mainly by Wrens in a section named the [[Newmanry]] after its head [[Max Newman]].

Bletchley's work was essential to defeating the [[U-boat]]s in the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1939–1945)|Battle of the Atlantic]], and to the British naval victories in the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] and the [[Battle of North Cape]].
In 1941, Ultra exerted a powerful effect on the [[North African Campaign|North African desert campaign]] against German forces under General [[Erwin Rommel]].
General Sir [[Claude Auchinleck]] wrote that were it not for Ultra, &quot;Rommel would have certainly got through to Cairo&quot;.
While not changing the events,&lt;!--maybe instead we should list more situations in which events WERE changed--&gt; &quot;[[Ultra (cryptography)|Ultra]]&quot; decrypts featured prominently in the story of [[Operation Salaam|Operation SALAM]], [[László Almásy]]'s daring mission across the [[Libyan Desert]] behind enemy lines in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Kuno, Michael Rolke and András Zboray, [http://fjexpeditions.com/resources/salam/operation_salam.htm Operation SALAM] - László Almásy’s most daring Mission in the Desert War, Belleville, München, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to the [[Normandy landings]] on D-Day in June 1944, the Allies knew the locations of all but two of Germany's fifty-eight Western-front divisions.

=== Italian signals ===
{{see also|Cryptanalysis of the Enigma}}
Italian signals had been of interest since Italy's attack on Abyssinia in 1935.
During the [[Spanish Civil War]] the [[Royal Italian Navy|Italian Navy]] used the K model of the commercial Enigma without a plugboard; this was solved by Knox in 1937.
When Italy entered the war in 1940 an improved version of the machine was used, though little traffic was sent by it and there were &quot;wholesale changes&quot; in Italian codes and cyphers.
Knox was given a new section for work on Enigma variations, which he staffed with women (&quot;Dilly's girls&quot;) who included [[Margaret Rock]], Jean Perrin, Clare Harding, Rachel Ronald, Elisabeth Granger; and [[Mavis Lever]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grey|2012|pp=132{{ndash}}3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{snd}}who made the first break into the Italian naval traffic.
She solved the signals revealing the Italian Navy's operational plans before the [[Battle of Cape Matapan]] in 1941, leading to a British victory.
Although most Bletchley staff did not know the results of their work, Admiral [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Cunningham]] visited Bletchley in person a few weeks later to congratulate them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Batey | first = Mavis | author-link = Mavis Batey | title = Breaking Italian Naval Enigma | year = 2011 | page = 81 }} in {{Harvnb|Erskine|Smith|2011|pp=79–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On entering World War II in June 1940, the [[Italy|Italians]] were using book codes for most of their military messages.
The exception was the [[Italian Navy]], which after the Battle of Cape Matapan started using the [[C-38 (cipher machine)|C-38]] version of the [[Boris Hagelin]] [[Rotor machine|rotor-based]] [[cipher machine]], particularly to route their navy and merchant marine convoys to the conflict in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hinsley | first = Sir Harry | author-link = Harry Hinsley | title = The Influence of ULTRA in the Second World War | origyear = 1993 | year = 1996 | url = http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/Historical/hinsley.html | accessdate = 23 July 2012 }} Transcript of a lecture given on Tuesday 19 October 1993 at Cambridge University&lt;/ref&gt;
As a consequence, [[James Ramsay Montagu Butler|JRM Butler]] recruited his former student [[Bernard Willson]] to join a team with two others in Hut{{nbsp}}4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Dakin | first = Alec | year = 1993 | title = The Z Watch in Hut{{nbsp}}4, Part I }} in {{Harvnb|Hinsley|Stripp|1993|pp=50{{ndash}}56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wilkinson | first = Patrick | year = 1993 | title = Italian naval ciphers }} in {{Harvnb|Hinsley|Stripp|1993|pp=61–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1941, Willson became the first of the team to decode the Hagelin system, thus enabling military commanders to direct the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force]] to sink enemy ships carrying supplies from Europe to Rommel's [[Afrika Korps]]. This led to increased shipping losses and, from reading the intercepted traffic, the team learnt that between May and September 1941 the stock of fuel for the [[Luftwaffe]] in North Africa reduced by 90%.&lt;ref name=BPJuly41&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/archive/index/july1941.rhtm|title=July 1941|publisher=Bletchley Park|accessdate=23 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After an intensive language course, in March 1944 Willson switched to Japanese language-based codes.&lt;ref name=Express&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Kw2wfE8kvboJ:http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/316906/Our-family-war-heroes%2BBernard+Wilson+bletchley+park&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-GB%3Aofficial&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hl=en&amp;spell=1&amp;gs_l=heirloom-serp.3..0i30.6434.10993.0.11348.15.7.0.8.8.0.235.1062.1j3j3.7.0...0.0...1c.1.UkcNiT63Jnw&amp;ct=clnk|title=Our family war heroes|author=Anna Pukas|publisher=[[Daily Express]]|date=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Middle East Intelligence Centre (MEIC) was set up in Cairo in 1939.
When Italy entered the war in June 1940, delays in forwarding intercepts to Bletchley via congested radio links resulted in cryptanalysts being sent to Cairo.
A Combined Bureau Middle East (CBME) was set up in November, though the Middle East authorities made &quot;increasingly bitter complaints&quot; that [[GC&amp;CS]] was giving too little priority to work on Italian cyphers.
However, the principle of concentrating high-grade cryptanalysis at Bletchley was maintained.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Hinsley|Hinsley, Harry]] ''British Intelligence in the Second World War, Volume One: Its Influence on Strategy and Operations'' (1979, Her Majesties Stationery Office, London) pp 191{{ndash}}221, 570{{ndash}}2 ISBN 0 11 630933 4&lt;/ref&gt;
[[John Chadwick]] started cryptanalysis work in 1942 on Italian signals at the naval base 'HMS Nile' in Alexandria.
Later he was with GC&amp;CS; in the Heliopolis Museum, Cairo and then in the Villa Laurens, Alexandria.

=== Soviet signals ===
Soviet signals had been studied since the 1920s.
In 1939{{ndash}}40 [[John Tiltman]] (who had worked on Russian Army traffic from 1930) set up two Russian sections at Wavendon (a country house near Bletchley) and at [[Sarafand]] in Palestine.
Two Russian high-grade army and navy systems were broken.{{when|date=April 2014}}{{clarify|date=April 2014}}
Tiltman spent two weeks in Finland, where he obtained Russian traffic from Finland and Estonia in exchange for radio equipment.
In June 1941 when the Soviet Union became an ally, Churchill ordered a halt to intelligence operations against her.
In December 1941 the Russian section was closed down, but in late summer 1943 or late 1944 a small GC&amp;CS Russian cypher section was set up in London overlooking Park Lane then in Sloane Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Smith | first = Michael | author-link = Michael Smith (newspaper reporter) | title = The Government Code and Cypher School and the First Cold War | year = 2011 | pages = 13–34 }} in {{Harvnb|Erskine|Smith|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japanese signals===
An outpost of the Government Code and Cypher School had been set up in Hong Kong in 1935, the [[Far East Combined Bureau]] (FECB). The FECB naval staff moved in 1940 to Singapore, then [[Colombo]], [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]], then [[Kilindini Harbour|Kilindini]], [[Mombasa]], Kenya. They succeeded in deciphering Japanese codes with a mixture of skill and good fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Smith | first=Michael | title=Mombasa was base for high-level UK espionage operation | url=http://www.coastweek.com/codes.htm | work=coastweek.com | publisher=Coastweek | accessdate=20 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Army and Air Force staff went from Singapore to the [[Wireless Experimental Centre]] at [[Delhi]], India.

In early 1942, a six-month crash course in Japanese, for 20 undergraduates from Oxford and Cambridge, was started by the Inter-Services Special Intelligence School in Bedford, in a building across from the main Post Office. This course was repeated every six months until war's end. 
Most of those completing these courses worked on decoding Japanese naval messages in [[Hut&amp;nbsp;7]], under [[John Tiltman]].

By mid-1945 well over 100 personnel were involved with this operation, which co-operated closely with the FECB and the US Signal intelligence Service at [[Arlington Hall]], Virginia.
Because of these joint efforts, by August of that year the Japanese merchant navy was suffering 90% losses at sea.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} In 1999, Michael Smith wrote that: &quot;Only now are the British codebreakers (like [[John Tiltman]], [[Hugh Foss]], and [[Eric Nave]]) beginning to receive the recognition they deserve for breaking Japanese codes and cyphers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2001|pp=127{{ndash}}51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post war==

===Continued secrecy===
Much of Bletchley's equipment and documents were destroyed at the end of the war,{{clarify|date=April 2014}}
and the secrecy imposed on Bletchley staff remained in force, so that most relatives never knew more than that a child, spouse, or parent had done some kind of secret war work,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hill|2004|pp=129{{ndash}}35}}&lt;/ref&gt; or were told a cover story about clerical or statistical work.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}
Churchill referred to the Bletchley staff as &quot;The geese that laid the golden eggs and never cackled&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewin|2001|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the publication of [[F. W. Winterbotham|F.{{nbsp}}W. Winterbotham's]] ''The Ultra Secret'' (1974)&lt;ref&gt;
{{Citation | last = Winterbotham | first = F. W. | author-link = F.W.

public discussion of Bletchley's work finally became possible (though even today some former staff still consider themselves bound to silence)&lt;ref&gt;

and in July 2009 the British government announced that Bletchley personnel would be recognised with a commemorative badge.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/5789263/Enigma-codebreakers-to-be-honoured-finally.html|title=Enigma codebreakers to be honoured finally|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Site===
After the war the site passed through a succession of hands,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art9678.asp BellaOnline &quot;Britain's Best Kept Secret&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and saw a number of uses, including as a teacher-training college and local [[General Post Office|GPO]] headquarters.
By 1991, the site was nearly empty and the buildings were at risk of demolition for redevelopment.

In February 1992 the [[Milton Keynes Borough Council]] declared most of the Park a conservation area, and the Bletchley Park Trust was formed to maintain the site as a museum. The site opened to visitors in 1993, and was formally inaugurated by HRH The Duke of Kent, as Chief Patron, in July 1994. In 1999 the Trust concluded an agreement with the landowner, giving control over much of the site to the Trust.{{clarify|date=April 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/content/hist/recent.rhtm Bletchley Park Trust &quot;Bletchley Park History&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:ColossusRebuild 11.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|right|[[Anthony Sale|Tony Sale]] supervising the breaking of an enciphered message with the completed [[Colossus computer]] rebuild in 2006]]

This is housed in Block H, which is rented from the Bletchley Park Trust. Its Colossus and Tunny galleries tell an important part of allied breaking of German codes during World War II. There is a working reconstruction of a [[Colossus computer]] that was used on the high-level [[Lorenz cipher]] that was codenamed ''Tunny'' by the British.&lt;ref name=&quot;codesandciphers.org.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.codesandciphers.org.uk/lorenz/rebuild.htm Tony Sale &quot;The Colossus Rebuild Project&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Museum of Computing, which opened in 2007, is an independent voluntary organisation that is governed by its own board of trustees. The aim of the museum is &quot;To collect and restore computer systems particularly those developed in Britain and to enable people to explore that collection for inspiration, learning and enjoyment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Mission Statement of The National Museum of Computing | publisher = CodesandCiphers Heritage Trust | url = http://www.tnmoc.org/about-us | accessdate = 8 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through its many exhibits, the museum displays the story of computing through the mainframes of the 1960s and 1970s, and the rise of personal computing in the 1980s. It has a policy of having as many of the exhibits as possible in full working order. The Colossus and Tunny galleries are open daily. The rest of the Museum is open to the public every Thursday, Saturday and Sunday afternoons and most bank holidays, and by appointment for groups only, at other times. There are guided tours on Tuesday afternoons. There is a modest admission charge to the museum to help cover overheads.

The BBC declined to produce the show and develop it further before creating effectively the same show on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] several years later, featuring some of the same cast, entitled ''[[Hut 33]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007r8hg BBC Radio 4 — Comedy — Hut 33&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the unseen pilot are to be shown on documentaries about Bob Monkhouse on both ITV and BBC in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3549961.stm | publisher=[[BBC News]] | title=Bob Monkhouse's last laugh | date=19 March 2004 | first=Ian | last=Youngs}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The play ''[[Breaking the Code]]'' is also set at Bletchley.
* The ITV television serial ''[[Danger UXB]]'' featured the character Steven Mount, who was a codebreaker at Bletchley, and was driven to a [[nervous breakdown]] (and eventual suicide) by the stressful and repetitive nature of the work.
* In the BBC's ''[[Torchwood]]'' series, the character Toshiko Sato is revealed to have had a grandfather who worked at Bletchley Park up until the [[bombing of Pearl Harbor]] by Japan. Whether he continued working there after Japan declared war on the Allies is unknown.
* A fictionalised version of Bletchley Park is featured in the novel ''[[Cryptonomicon]]'' by [[Neal Stephenson]].
* Bletchley came to wider public attention with the 1999 documentary series ''[[Station X (TV documentary)|Station X]]''.
* Bletchley Park plays a significant role in the [[Connie Willis]] book ''[[All Clear]]''.
* A mission in the Russian video game ''[[Death to Spies: Moment of Truth]]'' is called &quot;Bletchley Park&quot;. It is set in a partial reconstruction of the actual estate, with certain landmarks and huts carefully reproduced. However, the plot does not involve Enigma, which is ironic, since in another mission of the same game the player is tasked with stealing an Enigma machine from a German submarine.
* ''[[The Bletchley Circle]]'' (ITV, 2012) is a set of murder mysteries set in 1952 and 1953, the first series telling a story of how four female former Bletchley code breakers use their skills to track down a serial killer. The opening scene of part one was filmed on-site, and the set was asked to remain there for its close adaptation of historiography.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph hollingshead 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Hollingshead |first=Iain |title=What happened to the women of Bletchley Park? |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9520807/What-happened-to-the-women-of-Bletchley-Park.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |date=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;itv shaw 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Shaw |first=Malcolm |title=Bletchley Park drama to air on television |url=http://www.itv.com/news/meridian/2012-09-06/bletchley-park-drama-to-air-on-television/ |publisher=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] |accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
