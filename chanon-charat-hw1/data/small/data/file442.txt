Algebraic number
      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], an '''algebraic number''' is a number that is a [[root of a function|root]] of a non-zero [[polynomial]] in one variable with [[rational number|rational]] coefficients (or equivalently — by clearing [[denominator]]s — with [[integer]] coefficients). Numbers such as [[Pi|{{pi}}]] that are not algebraic are said to be [[transcendental number|transcendental]]. [[Almost all]] [[real number|real]] and [[complex number|complex]] numbers are transcendental. (Here &quot;almost all&quot; has the sense &quot;all but a [[countable set]]&quot;; see [[#Properties|Properties]].)

== Examples ==

*The [[rational number]]s, expressed as the quotient of two [[integer]]s ''a'' and ''b'', ''b'' not equal to zero, satisfy the above definition because &lt;math&gt;x=a/b&lt;/math&gt; is the root of &lt;math&gt;bx-a&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Some of the following examples come from Hardy and Wright 1972:159–160 and pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[quadratic surd]]s (irrational roots of a quadratic polynomial &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c&lt;/math&gt; with integer coefficients &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;) are algebraic numbers. If the quadratic polynomial is monic &lt;math&gt;(a = 1)&lt;/math&gt; then the roots are [[quadratic integer]]s.

*The [[constructible number]]s are those numbers that can be constructed from a given unit length using straightedge and compass and their opposites. These include all quadratic surds, all rational numbers, and all numbers that can be formed from these using the [[Arithmetic#Arithmetic operations|basic arithmetic operations]] and the extraction of square roots. (Note that by designating cardinal directions for 1, −1, &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;-i&lt;/math&gt;, complex numbers such as &lt;math&gt;3+\sqrt{2}i&lt;/math&gt; are considered constructible.)

*Any expression formed using any combination of the basic arithmetic operations and extraction of [[nth root|''n''th roots]] gives an algebraic number.

*Polynomial roots that ''cannot'' be expressed in terms of the basic arithmetic operations and extraction of ''n''th roots (such as the roots of &lt;math&gt;x^5 - x + 1 &lt;/math&gt;). This [[Abel–Ruffini theorem|happens with many]], but not all, polynomials of degree 5 or higher.

*[[Gaussian integer]]s: those complex numbers &lt;math&gt;a+bi&lt;/math&gt; where both &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are integers are also quadratic integers.

*[[Trigonometric functions]] of [[rational number|rational]] multiples of &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; (except when undefined). For example, each of &lt;math&gt;\cos(\pi/7)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\cos(3\pi/7)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\cos(5\pi/7)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies &lt;math&gt;8x^3 - 4x^2 - 4x + 1 = 0&lt;/math&gt;. This polynomial is [[irreducible polynomial|irreducible]] over the rationals, and so these three cosines are ''conjugate'' algebraic numbers. Likewise, &lt;math&gt;\tan(3\pi/16)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tan(7\pi/16)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tan(11\pi/16)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tan(15\pi/16)&lt;/math&gt; all satisfy the irreducible polynomial &lt;math&gt;x^4 - 4x^3 - 6x^2 + 4x + 1&lt;/math&gt;, and so are conjugate [[algebraic integers]].

*Some [[irrational number]]s are algebraic and some are not:
**The numbers &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3]{3}/2&lt;/math&gt; are algebraic since they are roots of polynomials &lt;math&gt;x^2 - 2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;8x^3 - 3&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.
**The [[golden ratio]] &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is algebraic since it is a root of the polynomial &lt;math&gt;x^2 - x - 1&lt;/math&gt;.
**The numbers [[Pi|&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;]] and [[e (mathematical constant)|&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;]] are not algebraic numbers (see the [[Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem]]);&lt;ref&gt;Also [[Liouville number|Liouville's theorem]] can be used to &quot;produce as many examples of transcendentals numbers as we please,&quot; cf Hardy and Wright p. 161ff&lt;/ref&gt; hence they are transcendental.

*The set of algebraic numbers is [[countable set|countable]] (enumerable).&lt;ref&gt;Hardy and Wright 1972:160&lt;/ref&gt;
*Hence, the set of algebraic numbers has [[Lebesgue measure]] zero (as a subset of the complex numbers), i.e. &quot;[[Almost everywhere|almost all]]&quot; complex numbers are not algebraic.
*Given an algebraic number, there is a unique [[monic polynomial]] (with rational coefficients) of least [[degree of a polynomial|degree]] that has the number as a root. This polynomial is called its [[minimal polynomial (field theory)|minimal polynomial]]. If its minimal polynomial has degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, then the algebraic number is said to be of ''degree &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;''. An algebraic number of degree 1 is a [[rational number]]. A real algebraic number of degree 2 is a [[quadratic irrational]].
*All algebraic numbers are [[computable number|computable]] and therefore [[definable number|definable]] and [[arithmetical numbers|arithmetical]].
*The set of real algebraic numbers is [[linearly ordered]], countable, [[densely ordered]], and without first or last element, so is [[order-isomorphic]] to the set of rational numbers.

==The field of algebraic numbers==
[[File:Algebraic number in the complex plane.png|thumb|Algebraic numbers colored by degree (blue=4, cyan=3, red=2, green=1). The unit circle in black.]]
The sum, difference, product and quotient of two algebraic numbers is again algebraic (this fact can be demonstrated using the [[resultant]]), and the algebraic numbers therefore form a [[field (mathematics)|field]], sometimes denoted by '''A''' (which may also denote the [[adele ring]]) or &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: overline;&quot;&gt;'''Q'''&lt;/span&gt;. Every root of a polynomial equation whose coefficients are ''algebraic numbers'' is again algebraic. This can be rephrased by saying that the field of algebraic numbers is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]]. In fact, it is the smallest algebraically closed field containing the rationals, and is therefore called the [[algebraic closure]] of the rationals.

===Numbers defined by radicals===
All numbers that can be obtained from the integers using a [[finite set|finite]] number of integer [[addition]]s, [[subtraction]]s, [[multiplication]]s, [[division (mathematics)|division]]s, and taking ''n''th roots (where ''n'' is a positive integer) are algebraic. The converse, however, is not true: there are algebraic numbers that cannot be obtained in this manner. All of these numbers are solutions to polynomials of degree ≥5. This is a result of [[Galois theory]] (see [[Quintic equation]]s and the [[Abel–Ruffini theorem]]). An example of such a number is the unique real root of the polynomial {{nowrap|''x''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; − ''x'' − 1}} (which is approximately 1.167304).

===Closed-form number===
{{Main|Closed-form number}}
Algebraic numbers are all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials, starting from the rational numbers. One may generalize this to &quot;[[closed-form number]]s&quot;, which may be defined in various ways. Most broadly, all numbers that can be defined explicitly or implicitly in terms of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms are called &quot;elementary numbers&quot;, and these include the algebraic numbers, plus some transcendental numbers. Most narrowly, one may consider numbers ''explicitly'' defined in terms of polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms – this does not include algebraic numbers, but does include some simple transcendental numbers such as ''e'' or log(2).

==Algebraic integers==

[[Image:Leadingcoeff.png|thumb|Algebraic numbers colored by leading coefficient (red signifies 1 for an algebraic integer).]]
An '''[[algebraic integer]]''' is an algebraic number that is a root of  a polynomial with integer coefficients with leading coefficient 1 (a monic polynomial). Examples of algebraic integers are {{nowrap|5 + 13√{{overline|2}}}}, {{nowrap|2 − 6''i''}}, and {{nowrap|{{frac|1|2}}(1 + ''i''√{{overline|3}}).}} Note, therefore, that the algebraic integers constitute a proper [[superset]] of the [[integer]]s, as the latter are the roots of monic polynomials {{nowrap|''x'' − ''k''}} for all {{nowrap|''k'' ∈ '''Z'''.}} In this sense, algebraic integers are to algebraic numbers what [[integer]]s are to [[rational number]]s.

The sum, difference and product of algebraic integers are again algebraic integers, which means that the algebraic integers form a [[ring (algebra)|ring]]. The name ''algebraic integer'' comes from the fact that the only rational numbers that are algebraic integers are the integers, and because the algebraic integers in any [[algebraic number field|number field]] are in many ways analogous to the integers. If ''K'' is a number field, its [[ring of integers]] is the subring of algebraic integers in ''K'', and is frequently denoted as ''O&lt;sub&gt;K&lt;/sub&gt;''. These are the prototypical examples of [[Dedekind domain]]s.
