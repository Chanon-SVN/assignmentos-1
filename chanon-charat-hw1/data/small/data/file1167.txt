'''Arsenal Football Club ''' is a professional [[association football|football]] club based in [[Holloway, London]] which currently plays in the [[Premier League]], the highest level of English football. One of the [[Football records in England#Total titles won (1871–present)|most successful clubs]] in English football, they have won 13 [[Football League First Division|First Division]] and Premier League titles and a joint record 11 [[FA Cup]]s.

Arsenal's success has been particularly consistent: the club has accumulated the second most points in English top-flight football,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=English Premier League : Full All Time Table|url=http://www.statto.com/football/stats/england/premier-league/all-time-table/full|website=statto.com|accessdate=25 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; hold the ongoing record for the longest uninterrupted period in the top flight, and would be placed first in an aggregated league of the entire 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Independent: Hodgson&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Football: How consistency and caution made Arsenal England's greatest team of the 20th century|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-how-consistency-and-caution-made-arsenal-englands-greatest-team-of-the-20th-century-1133020.html|work=The Independent|accessdate=27 April 2012|location=London|first=Guy|last=Hodgson|date=17 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenal is the second side to complete an English top-flight season [[The Invincibles (football)|unbeaten]] (in the [[2003–04 FA Premier League|2003–04 season]]), playing almost twice as many matches as the previous invincibles [[The Invincibles (football)#Preston North End|Preston North End]] in the 1888–89 season.

Arsenal was founded in 1886 in [[Woolwich]] and in 1893 became the first club from the south of England to join [[the Football League]]. In 1913, they moved north across the city to [[Arsenal Stadium]] in [[Highbury]]. In the 1930s, they won five League Championship titles and two FA Cups. After a lean period in the post-war years they won the [[Double (association football)#England|League and FA Cup Double]], in the [[1970–71 in English football|1970–71 season]], and in the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, won two more Doubles and reached the [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final]]. Since neighbouring [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], the two clubs have had a fierce rivalry, the [[North London derby]].

Arsenal have one of the highest incomes and largest fanbases in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Connor|first1=Ashling|title=Liverpool lag in fight for global fan supremacy as TV row grows|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/sport/football/premierleague/article3192868.ece|accessdate=25 June 2014|publisher=The Times|date=13 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Football Money League|url=http://www.deloitte.com/view/en_GB/uk/industries/sportsbusinessgroup/sports/football/deloitte-football-money-league/|website=deloitte.com|publisher=Deloitte|accessdate=25 June 2014|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was named the [[Forbes' list of the most valuable football clubs|fifth most valuable association football club in the world]], valued at £1.3 billion in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soccer Team Values|url=http://www.forbes.com/soccer-valuations/list/|website=forbes.com|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=25 June 2014|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arsenal Football Club was formed as Dial Square in 1886 by workers at the [[Royal Arsenal]] in [[Woolwich]], south-east London, and was renamed Royal Arsenal shortly afterwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;soartyler23&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first1=Phil |last1=Soar |first2=Martin |last2=Tyler |title=The Official Illustrated History of Arsenal | publisher=Hamlyn | year=2005 | page=23 | isbn=978-0-600-61344-2 |lastauthoramp=&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club was renamed again to Woolwich Arsenal after becoming a [[limited company]] in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/andy.kelly/arsenal/record/namechange.htm

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club became the first southern member of [[the Football League]] in 1893, starting out in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], and won promotion to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in 1904. The club's relative geographic isolation resulted in lower attendances than those of other clubs, which led to the club becoming mired in financial problems and effectively bankrupt by 1910, when they was taken over by businessmen [[Henry Norris (businessman)|Henry Norris]] and William Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Soar &amp; Tyler | year=2005 | title=The Official Illustrated History of Arsenal | pages=32–33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Norris sought to move the club elsewhere, and in 1913, soon after relegation back to the Second Division, Arsenal moved to the new [[Arsenal Stadium]] in [[Highbury]], North London; they dropped &quot;Woolwich&quot; from their name the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Soar &amp; Tyler | year=2005 | title=The Official Illustrated History of Arsenal | page=40 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenal only finished in fifth place in the second division during the last pre-war competitive season of 1914–15, but was nevertheless elected to rejoin the First Division when competitive football resumed in 1919–20, at the expense of local rivals [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. Some books have reported that this election to division 1 was achieved by dubious means.&lt;ref&gt;It has been alleged that Arsenal's promotion, on historical grounds rather than merit, was thanks to underhand actions by Norris, who was chairman of the club at the time; see [[History of Arsenal F.C. (1886–1966)]] for more details. These allegations range from political machinations to outright bribery; no firm proof of any wrongdoing has ever been found.

Arsenal appointed [[Herbert Chapman]] as manager in 1925. Having already won the league twice with [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] in [[1923–24 Football League|1923–24]] and [[1924–25 Football League|1924–25]] (see [[Football in England#Seasons in English football|Seasons in English football]]), Chapman brought Arsenal their first period of major success. His revolutionary tactics and training, along with the signings of star players such as [[Alex James (footballer)|Alex James]] and [[Cliff Bastin]], laid the foundations of the club's domination of English football in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Soar &amp; Tyler | year=2005 | title=The Official Illustrated History of Arsenal | page=18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under his guidance Arsenal won their first major trophies&amp;nbsp;– victory in the [[1930 FA Cup Final]] preceded two League Championships, in [[1930–31 Football League|1930–31]] and [[1932–33 Football League|1932–33]]. In addition, Chapman was behind the 1932 renaming of the local [[London Underground]] station from &quot;Gillespie Road&quot; to &quot;[[Arsenal tube station|Arsenal]]&quot;, making it the only Tube station to be named specifically after a football club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/static/corporate/media/newscentre/archive/3709.html | title=London Underground and Arsenal present The Final Salute to Highbury | publisher=Transport for London | date=12 January 2006 | accessdate=12 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapman died suddenly of [[pneumonia]] in early 1934, leaving [[Joe Shaw (footballer born 1883)|Joe Shaw]] and [[George Allison]] to carry on his successful work. Under their guidance, Arsenal won three more titles, in [[1933–34 Football League|1933–34]], [[1934–35 Football League|1934–35]] and [[1937–38 Football League|1937–38]], and the [[1935–36 FA Cup|1936 FA Cup]] while also becoming known as the &quot;[[Bank of England club]].&quot; As key players retired, Arsenal had started to fade by the decade's end, and then the intervention of the Second World War meant competitive professional football in England was suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After the war, Arsenal enjoyed a second period of success under Allison's successor [[Tom Whittaker (footballer)|Tom Whittaker]], winning the league in [[1947–48 Football League|1947–48]] and [[1952–53 Football League|1952–53]], and the FA Cup in [[1949–50 FA Cup|1950]]. Their fortunes waned thereafter; unable to attract players of the same calibre as they had in the 1930s, the club spent most of the 1950s and 1960s in trophyless mediocrity. Even former [[England national football team|England]] captain [[Billy Wright (footballer born 1924)|Billy Wright]] could not bring the club any success as manager, in a stint between 1962 and 1966.&lt;ref name=FCHD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Arsenal began winning silverware again with the surprise appointment of club [[physiotherapist]] [[Bertie Mee]] as manager in 1966. After losing two [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] finals, they won their first European trophy, the [[1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup]]. This was followed by an even greater triumph: their first [[1970–71 Football League|League]] and [[1970–71 FA Cup|FA Cup]] [[Double (association football)|double]] in [[1970–71 in English football|1970–71]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=23 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked a premature high point of the decade; the Double-winning side was soon broken up and the following decade was characterised by a series of near misses, starting with Arsenal finishing as FA Cup runners up in [[1971–72 FA Cup|1972]], and First Division runners-up in [[1972–73 Football League|1972–73]].

[[Terry Neill]] was recruited by the Arsenal board to replace [[Bertie Mee]] on 9 July 1976 and at the age of 34 he became the youngest Arsenal manager to date. With new signings like [[Malcolm Macdonald]] and [[Pat Jennings]], and a crop of talent in the side such as [[Liam Brady]] and [[Frank Stapleton]], the club enjoyed their best form since the 1971 double, reaching a trio of FA Cup finals ([[1977–78 FA Cup|1978]], [[1978–79 FA Cup|1979]] and [[1979–80 FA Cup|1980]]), and losing the [[1980 European Cup Winners' Cup Final]] on [[penalty shootout (association football)|penalties]]. The club's only success during this time was a last-minute 3–2 victory over Manchester United in the [[1979 FA Cup Final]], widely regarded as a classic.&lt;ref name=FCHD&gt;{{cite web

The return of former player [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] as manager in 1986 brought a third period of glory. Arsenal won the League Cup in [[1986–87 Football League Cup|1987]], Graham's first season in charge. This was followed by a League title win in [[1988–89 Football League|1988–89]], won with a last-minute goal in the [[Liverpool 0–2 Arsenal (26 May 1989)|final game of the season]] against fellow title challengers [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. Graham's Arsenal won another title in [[1990–91 Football League|1990–91]], losing only one match, won the [[1992–93 FA Cup|FA Cup]] and [[1992–93 Football League Cup|League Cup]] double in 1993, and a second European trophy, the [[European Cup Winners' Cup]], in [[1993–94 European Cup Winners' Cup|1994]].&lt;ref name=FCHD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The club's success in the late 1990s and first decade of the 21st century owed a great deal to the 1996 appointment of [[Arsène Wenger]] as manager. Wenger brought new tactics, a new training regime and several foreign players who complemented the existing English talent. Arsenal won a second League and Cup double in [[1997–98 Arsenal F.C. season|1997–98]] and a third in [[2001–02 Arsenal F.C. season|2001–02]]. In addition, the club reached the final of the [[1999–2000 UEFA Cup]] (losing on penalties to [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]]), was victorious in the [[2002–03 FA Cup|2003]] and [[2004–05 FA Cup|2005]] FA Cups, and won the Premier League in [[2003–04 FA Premier League|2003–04]] without losing a single match, an achievement which earned the side the nickname &quot;[[The Invincibles (football)|The Invincibles]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;invincibles&quot;&gt;{{cite news

The club had not gained a major trophy since the 2005 FA Cup until 17 May 2014, when Arsenal beat [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] in the [[2014 FA Cup Final]], coming back from a 2–0 deficit to win the match 3–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/18/arsene-wenger-fa-cup-arsenal-hull-trophy-drought

==Crest==
[[File:Arsenal crest 1888.png|thumb|right|Arsenal's first crest from 1888]]

Unveiled in 1888, Royal Arsenal's first crest featured three [[cannon]] viewed from above, pointing northwards, similar to the [[coat of arms]] of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Woolwich]]. These can sometimes be mistaken for chimneys, but the presence of a carved lion's head and a [[cascabel (artillery)|cascabel]] on each are clear indicators that they are cannon.&lt;ref name=&quot;crest&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.arsenal.com/history/the-crest | title=The Crest | publisher=Arsenal F.C | accessdate=11 August 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080812085724/http://www.arsenal.com/history/the-crest| archivedate= 12 August 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was dropped after the move to Highbury in 1913, only to be reinstated in 1922, when the club adopted a crest featuring a single cannon, pointing eastwards, with the club's nickname, ''The Gunners'', inscribed alongside it; this crest only lasted until 1925, when the cannon was reversed to point westward and its barrel slimmed down.&lt;ref name=&quot;crest&quot;/&gt;

In 1949, the club unveiled a modernised crest featuring the same style of cannon below the club's name, set in [[blackletter]], and above the coat of arms of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Islington]] and a scroll inscribed with the club's newly adopted Latin [[motto]], ''Victoria Concordia Crescit''  &quot;victory comes from harmony&quot;, coined by the club's programme editor Harry Homer.&lt;ref name=&quot;crest&quot;/&gt; For the first time, the crest was rendered in colour, which varied slightly over the crest's lifespan, finally becoming red, gold and green. Because of the numerous revisions of the crest, Arsenal was unable to [[copyright]] it. Although the club had managed to register the crest as a trademark, and had fought (and eventually won) a long legal battle with a local street trader who sold &quot;unofficial&quot; Arsenal merchandise,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenal eventually sought a more comprehensive legal protection. Therefore, in 2002 they introduced a new crest featuring more modern curved lines and a simplified style, which was copyrightable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cannon once again faces east and the club's name is written in a [[sans-serif]] typeface above the cannon. Green was replaced by dark blue. The new crest was criticised by some supporters; the Arsenal Independent Supporters' Association claimed that the club had ignored much of Arsenal's history and tradition with such a radical modern design, and that fans had not been properly consulted on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Until the 1960s, a badge was worn on the playing shirt only for high-profile matches such as FA Cup finals, usually in the form of a [[monogram]] of the club's initials in red on a white background.&lt;ref name=&quot;shirt badge&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The monogram theme was developed into an [[Art Deco]]-style badge on which the letters A and C framed a football rather than the letter F, the whole set within a hexagonal border. This early example of a corporate logo, introduced as part of Herbert Chapman's rebranding of the club in the 1930s, was used not only on Cup Final shirts but as a design feature throughout Highbury Stadium, including above the main entrance and inlaid in the floors.&lt;ref name=&quot;artdeco&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1967, a white cannon was regularly worn on the shirts, until replaced by the club crest, sometimes with the addition of the nickname &quot;The Gunners&quot;, in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;shirt badge&quot;/&gt;

In the 2011–2012 season, Arsenal celebrated their 125th year anniversary. The celebrations included a modified version of the current crest worn on their jerseys for the season. The crest was all white, surrounded by 15 [[oak]] leaves to the right and 15 [[Laurel wreath|laurel]] leaves to the left. The oak leaves represent the 15 founding members of the club who met at the Royal Oak pub. The 15 laurel leaves represent the design detail on the six pence pieces paid by the founding fathers to establish the club. The laurel leaves also represent strength. To complete the crest, 1886 and 2011 are shown on either sides of the motto &quot;Forward&quot; at the bottom of the crest.&lt;ref name=&quot;125th anniversary crest&quot;&gt;{{cite web

For much of Arsenal's history, their home colours have been bright red shirts with white sleeves and white shorts, though this has not always been the case. The choice of red is in recognition of a charitable donation from [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], soon after Arsenal's foundation in 1886. Two of Dial Square's founding members, [[Fred Beardsley]] and [[Morris Bates]], were former Forest players who had moved to Woolwich for work. As they put together the first team in the area, no kit could be found, so Beardsley and Bates wrote home for help and received a set of kit and a ball.&lt;ref name=&quot;soartyler23&quot;/&gt; The shirt was redcurrant, a dark shade of red, and was worn with white shorts and socks with blue and white hoops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arsenal home kit|url=http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/the-arsenal-kit|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;historicalkits&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In 1933, Herbert Chapman, wanting his players to be more distinctly dressed, updated the kit, adding white sleeves and changing the shade to a brighter [[pillar box]] red. Two possibilities have been suggested for the origin of the white sleeves. One story reports that Chapman noticed a supporter in the stands wearing a red sleeveless sweater over a white shirt; another was that he was inspired by a similar outfit worn by the cartoonist [[Tom Webster (cartoonist)|Tom Webster]], with whom Chapman played golf.&lt;ref name=&quot;kitdesign&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Regardless of which story is true, the red and white shirts have come to define Arsenal and the team have worn the combination ever since, aside from two seasons. The first was 1966–67, when Arsenal wore all-red shirts;&lt;ref name=&quot;historicalkits&quot; /&gt; this proved unpopular and the white sleeves returned the following season. The second was 2005–06, the last season that Arsenal played at Highbury, when the team wore commemorative redcurrant shirts similar to those worn in 1913, their first season in the stadium; the club reverted to their normal colours at the start of the next season.&lt;ref name=&quot;kitdesign&quot;/&gt; In the 2008–09 season, Arsenal replaced the traditional all-white sleeves with red sleeves with a broad white stripe.&lt;ref name=&quot;historicalkits&quot; /&gt;

Arsenal's home colours have been the inspiration for at least three other clubs. In 1909, [[AC Sparta Prague|Sparta Prague]] adopted a dark red kit like the one Arsenal wore at the time;&lt;ref name=&quot;kitdesign&quot;/&gt; in 1938, [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] adopted the design of the Arsenal shirt sleeves in their own green and white strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Braga|Sporting Clube de Braga]]'s manager returned from a game at Highbury and changed his team's green kit to a duplicate of Arsenal's red with white sleeves and shorts, giving rise to the team's nickname of ''Os Arsenalistas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

For many years Arsenal's away colours were white shirts and either black or white shorts. In the 1969–70 season, Arsenal introduced an away kit of yellow shirts with blue shorts. This kit was worn in the [[1971 FA Cup Final]] as Arsenal beat Liverpool to secure the [[Double (association football)|double]] for the first time in their history.&lt;ref name=cupfinal&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.historicalkits.co.uk/English_Football_League/FA_Cup_Finals/index.html|title=FA Cup Finals|accessdate=4 October 2013|work=Historical Football Kits}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenal reached the [[1972 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]] again the following year wearing the red and white home strip and were beaten by [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]]. Arsenal then competed in three consecutive FA Cup finals between [[1978 FA Cup Final|1978]] and [[1980 FA Cup Final|1980]] wearing their &quot;lucky&quot; yellow and blue strip,&lt;ref name=cupfinal/&gt; which remained the club's away strip until the release of a green and navy away kit in 1982–83. The following season, Arsenal returned to the yellow and blue scheme, albeit with a darker shade of blue than before.

When [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] took over from [[Adidas]] as Arsenal's kit provider in 1994, Arsenal's away colours were again changed to two-tone blue shirts and shorts. Since the advent of the lucrative replica kit market, the away kits have been changed regularly, with Arsenal usually releasing both away and third choice kits. During this period the designs have been either all blue designs, or variations on the traditional yellow and blue, such as the metallic gold and navy strip used in the 2001–02 season, the yellow and dark grey used from 2005 to 2007, and the yellow and maroon of 2010 to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Arsenal's shirts have been made by manufacturers including [[Bukta]] (from the 1930s until the early 1970s), [[Umbro]] (from the 1970s until 1986), [[Adidas]] (1986–1994), [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] (1994–2014), and [[Puma SE|Puma]] (from 2014).&lt;ref name=&quot;Puma deal&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Arsenal agree £30m-a-year deal with Puma in most lucrative kit contract in Britain|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2321029/Arsenal-sign-30m-year-deal-Puma-years-2013-14.html|accessdate=9 September 2013|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=8 May 2013|location=London|first=David|last=Kent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like those of most other major football clubs, Arsenal's shirts have featured sponsors' logos since the 1980s; sponsors include [[JVC]] (1982–1999), [[Sega]] (1999–2002), [[Telefónica Europe|O2]] (2002–2006), and [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]] (from 2006).&lt;ref name=&quot;historicalkits&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kitdesign&quot;/&gt;

==Stadiums==
{{Main|Emirates Stadium}}
[[File:Arsenal Stadium interior North Bank.jpg|thumb|left|The North Bank Stand, [[Arsenal Stadium]], [[Highbury]]|alt=A grandstand at a sports stadium. The seats are predominantly red.]]
For most of their time in south-east London, Arsenal played at the [[Manor Ground, Plumstead|Manor Ground]] in [[Plumstead]], apart from a three-year period at the nearby [[Invicta Ground]] between 1890 and 1893. The Manor Ground was initially just a field, until the club installed stands and [[terrace (stadium)|terracing]] for their first Football League match in September 1893. They played their home games there for the next twenty years (with two exceptions in the 1894–95 season), until the move to north London in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Inglis |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Inglis |title=Football Grounds of Britain |origyear=1985 |edition=3rd |year=1996 |publisher=CollinsWillow |location=London |isbn=0-00-218426-5 |pages=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Suspension of the Plumstead Ground |newspaper=The Times |date=7 February 1895 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Widely referred to as Highbury, [[Arsenal Stadium]] was the club's home from September 1913 until May 2006. The original stadium was designed by the renowned football architect [[Archibald Leitch]], and had a design common to many football grounds in the UK at the time, with a single covered stand and three open-air banks of terracing.&lt;ref name=&quot;conservation_plan&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.islington.gov.uk/DownloadableDocuments/Environment/Pdf/highburyconservationplan_2005.pdf

Highbury could hold more than 60,000 spectators at its peak, and had a capacity of 57,000 until the early 1990s. The [[Taylor Report]] and Premier League regulations obliged Arsenal to convert Highbury to an all-seater stadium in time for the 1993–94 season, thus reducing the capacity to 38,419 seated spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Expansion of Highbury was restricted because the East Stand had been designated as a Grade II [[listed building]] and the other three stands were close to residential properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;conservation_plan&quot;/&gt; These limitations prevented the club from maximising matchday revenue during the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, putting them in danger of being left behind in the football boom of that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

After considering various options, in 2000 Arsenal proposed building a new 60,361-capacity stadium at Ashburton Grove, since named the [[Emirates Stadium]], about 500&amp;nbsp;metres south-west of Highbury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The stadium was named after its sponsors, the airline company [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], with whom the club signed the largest sponsorship deal in English football history, worth around £100&amp;nbsp;million;&lt;ref name=&quot;emiratesdeal&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/3715678.stm | title=Arsenal name new ground |publisher=BBC Sport  | date=5 October 2004 | accessdate=11 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all major English football clubs, Arsenal have a number of domestic supporters' clubs, including the Arsenal Football Supporters' Club, which works closely with the club, and the Arsenal Independent Supporters' Association, which maintains a more independent line. The [[Arsenal Supporters' Trust]] promotes greater participation in ownership of the club by fans. The club's supporters also publish [[fanzine]]s such as ''The Gooner'', ''Gunflash'' and the satirical ''Up The Arse!''.

There have always been Arsenal supporters outside of London, and since the advent of satellite television, a supporter's attachment to a football club has become less dependent on geography.

{{details|Ownership of Arsenal F.C.}}
Arsenal's parent company, Arsenal Holdings plc, operates as a [[financial quote|non-quoted]] [[public limited company]], whose ownership is considerably different from that of other football clubs.

As one of the most successful teams in the country, Arsenal have often featured when football is depicted in the arts in Britain. They formed the backdrop to one of the earliest football-related films, ''[[The Arsenal Stadium Mystery]]'' (1939).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Many Arsenal players appeared as themselves and manager [[George Allison]] was given a speaking part.&lt;ref name=&quot;atthemovies&quot;/&gt; More recently, the book ''[[Fever Pitch]]'' by [[Nick Hornby]] was an autobiographical account of Hornby's life and relationship with football and Arsenal in particular.

Arsenal have often been stereotyped as a [[defender (association football)|defensive]] and &quot;boring&quot; side, especially during the 1970s and 1980s;&lt;ref name=&quot;noble&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/3037789.stm | title=No more boring, boring Arsenal | first=John |last=May |publisher=BBC Sport  |date=19 May 2003 | accessdate=7 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; many comedians, such as [[Eric Morecambe]], made jokes about this at the team's expense. The theme was repeated in the 1997 film ''[[The Full Monty]]'', in a scene where the lead actors move in a line and raise their hands, deliberately mimicking the Arsenal defence's [[offside trap]], in an attempt to co-ordinate their [[striptease]] routine.&lt;ref name=&quot;atthemovies&quot;&gt;{{cite web

They went a record total stretch of 995&amp;nbsp;minutes without letting an opponent score; the streak ended in [[2006 UEFA Champions League Final|the final]], when [[Samuel Eto'o]] scored a 76th-minute equaliser for Barcelona.&lt;ref name=&quot;2006ucl&quot;&gt;{{cite news
