==History==
The American Film Institute was founded by a 1965 presidential mandate announced in the [[White House Rose Garden|Rose Garden]] of the [[White House]] by [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] – to establish a national arts organization to preserve the legacy of [[American film]] heritage, educate the next generation of filmmakers and honor the artists and their work. Two years later, in 1967, AFI was established, supported by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] and the [[Ford Foundation]].

The original 22-member [[Board of Trustees]] included Chair [[Gregory Peck]] and Vice Chair [[Sidney Poitier]] as well as [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]], [[Jack Valenti]] and other representatives from the arts and academia.

The institute established a training program for filmmakers known then as the Center for Advanced Film Studies. Also created in the early years were a repertory film exhibition program at the [[Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]] and the [[AFI Catalog of Feature Films]] — a scholarly source for American film history.

The institute moved to its current eight-acre [[Hollywood]] campus in 1981.  The film training program grew into the [[AFI Conservatory]], an accredited graduate school.

AFI moved its presentation of first-run and &lt;!--SHOULD THIS BE AMATEUR?--&gt;[[auteur films]] from the [[Kennedy Center]] to the historic [[AFI Silver|1938 Art Deco AFI Silver Theatre and Cultural Center]], which now hosts two major film festivals – AFI Fest and AFI Docs –making AFI the largest nonprofit film exhibitor in the world.

AFI educates audiences and recognizes artistic excellence through its awards programs and [[AFI's 10 Top 10|10 Top 10 Lists]].

==AFI Conservatory==
In 1969, the institute established the [[AFI Conservatory]] for Advanced Film Studies at [[Greystone Mansion|Greystone, the Doheny Mansion]] in [[Beverly Hills]], [[California]].  The first class included filmmakers [[Terrence Malick]], [[David Lynch]], [[Caleb Deschanel]] and [[Paul Schrader]].  That program grew into the [[AFI Conservatory]], an accredited graduate [[film school]] located in the hills above Hollywood, California, providing training in six filmmaking disciplines: [[cinematography]], [[Film directing|directing]], [[Film editing|editing]], [[Film production#Production|producing]], [[production design]] and [[screenwriting]].  Mirroring a professional production environment, Fellows collaborate to make more films than any other graduate level program. Admission to AFI Conservatory is highly selective, with a maximum of 140 graduates per year.

In 2013, [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and [[Oscars|Oscar]]-winning director, producer and screenwriter [[James L. Brooks]] (''[[As Good as It Gets]]'', ''[[Broadcast News (film)|Broadcast News]]'', ''[[Terms of Endearment]]'') joined AFI as Artistic Director of the AFI Conservatory where he provides leadership for the film program.

Brooks' artistic role at the AFI Conservatory has a rich legacy that includes [[Daniel Petrie, Jr.]], [[Robert Wise]] and [[Frank Pierson]]. Award-winning director Bob Mandel serves as [[Dean (education)|Dean]] of the AFI Conservatory.
