Book of Nahum
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Tanakh OT|Nevi'im|prophetic}}

The '''Book of Nahum''' is the seventh book of the 12 [[minor prophets]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]]. It is attributed to the prophet [[Nahum]], and was probably written in [[Jerusalem]] in the 7th century BC.

== Background ==

[[Nahum]] prophesied, according to some, in the beginning of the reign of [[Ahaz]] (740s BC). Others, however, think that his prophecies are to be referred to the latter half of the reign of [[Hezekiah]] (8th century&amp;nbsp;BC). Probably the book was written in [[Jerusalem]], where he witnessed the invasion of [[Sennacherib]] and the destruction of his host ([[Books of Kings|2 Kings]] 19:35). And still others support the idea that the &quot;book of vision&quot; was written shortly before the fall of Nineveh&lt;ref name=&quot;Kent H. Richards 2006&quot; /&gt; at the hands of the Medes and Babylonians &lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan 2009&quot;&gt;Michael D. Coogan, A Brief Introduction to the Old Testament, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009) 297–298&lt;/ref&gt;(612&amp;nbsp;BC). This theory is evidenced by the fact that the oracles must be dated after the Assyrian destruction of Thebes in 663&amp;nbsp;BC as this event is mentioned in Nahum 3:8.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kent H.

Little is known about Nahum’s personal history. His name means &quot;comforter,&quot; and he was from the town of Alqosh, (Nahum 1:1) which scholars have attempted to identify with several cities, including the modern  [[Alqosh|`Alqush]] of [[Assyria]] and [[Capernaum|Capharnaum]] of northern [[Galilee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10670a.htm Nahum] at [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/index.html ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt; He was a very nationalistic Hebrew, and lived amongst the Elkoshites in peace.  One account suggests that his writings are a prophecy written in about 615 BC, just before the downfall of Assyria, while another account suggests that he wrote this passage as liturgy just after its downfall in 612 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heaton, E.

===Historical context===
[[File:Nineveh map city walls &amp; gates.JPG|thumb|right|Simplified plan of ancient [[Nineveh]], showing city wall and location of gateways.]]
The subject of Nahum's prophecy is the approaching complete and final destruction of [[Nineveh]], the capital of the great and at that time flourishing [[Assyria|Assyrian empire]]. [[Assur-bani-pal]] was at the height of his glory. Nineveh was a city of vast extent, and was then the center of the civilization and commerce of the world, a &quot;bloody city all full of lies and robbery&quot; (Nahum 3:1), for it had robbed and plundered all the neighboring nations. It was strongly fortified on every side, bidding defiance to every enemy.  One popular verse is 3:5, &quot;Behold, I am against thee, saith [[YHWH]] of hosts, and I will uncover thy skirts upon thy face; and I will show the nations thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.&quot; This is very symbolic showing that Nineveh was known for being a city full of prostitutes.

[[Jonah]] had already uttered his message of warning, and Nahum was followed by [[Zephaniah]], who also predicted ([[Book of Zephaniah|Zephaniah]] 2:4–15) the destruction of the city. 

Nineveh was destroyed apparently by fire around 625 BC, and the Assyrian empire came to an end, an event which changed the face of Asia.
Archaeological digs have uncovered the splendor of Nineveh in its zenith under [[Sennacherib]] (705–681 BC), [[Esarhaddon]] (681–669 BC), and [[Ashurbanipal]] (669–633 BC). Massive walls were eight miles in circumference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.bib-arch.org/nph-proxy.pl/000000A/http://www.basarchive.org/bswbSearch.asp=3fPubID=3dBSBA&amp;Volume=3d10&amp;Issue=3d2&amp;ArticleID=3d7&amp;UserID=3d0&amp; Destruction of Judean Fortress Portrayed in Dramatic Eighth-Century B.C.

== Overview ==

The book of Nahum consists of two parts:&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark 1994&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last1=Clark | first1=David J. | last2=Hatton | first2=Howard A. | year=1994 | title=The Books of Nahum, Habakkuk, and Zephaniah | location=New York | publisher=United Bible Societies | isbn=0-8267-0130-2 | page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter one shows the majesty and might of God the L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt; in goodness and severity.&lt;ref&gt;See also {{bibleverse||Romans|11:22|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chapters two and three describe the fall of Nineveh in 612&amp;nbsp;BCE. Nineveh is compared to [[Thebes (Egypt)|Thebes]], the Egyptian city that Assyria itself had destroyed in 663&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kent H. Richards 2006&quot;/&gt; Nahum describes the siege and frenzied activity of Nineveh’s troops as they try in vain to halt the invaders. Poetically, he becomes a participant in the battle, and with subtle irony, barks battle commands to the defenders. Nahum uses numerous similes and metaphors. Nineveh is ironically compared with a lion, in reference to the lion as an Assyrian symbol of power; Nineveh is the lion of strength that has a den full of dead prey but will become weak like the lion hiding in its den. It comes to conclusion with a taunt song and funeral dirge of the impending destruction of Nineveh and the &quot;sleep&quot; or death of the Assyrian people and demise of the once great Assyrian conqueror-rulers.

== Themes ==

===The fall of Nineveh===
Nahum’s prophecy carries a particular warning to the Ninevites of coming events, although he is partly in favor of the destruction.&lt;ref name=&quot;abp&quot;/&gt; One might even say that the book of Nahum is &quot;a celebration of the fall of Assyria.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan 2009&quot; /&gt; And this is not just a warning or speaking positively of the destruction of Ninevah, it is also a positive encouragement and &quot;message of comfort for Israel, Judah, and others who had experienced the &quot;endless cruelty&quot; (3:19) of the Assyrians.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Coogan 2009&quot; /&gt; The prophet [[Jonah]] shows us where God shows concern for the people of Nineveh, while Nahum’s writing testifies to his belief in the righteousness/justice of God&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/nahum.html Nahum] at [http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com earlyjewishwritings.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and how God dealt with those Assyrians in punishment according to &quot;their cruelty&quot; (Nahum 3:19). The Assyrians had been used as God's &quot;rod of [...] anger, and the staff in their hand [as] indignation.&quot; (Isaiah 10:5)

===The nature of God===
From its opening, Nahum shows God to be slow to anger but that He will by no means clear the guilty, but will bring his vengeance and wrath to pass.  God is presented as a God who will punish evil but will protect those who trust in Him.  The opening passage (Nahum 1:2–3) states:  &quot;God is jealous, and the L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt; revengeth; the L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt; revengeth, and is furious; the L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt; will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.  The L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt; is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked&quot;.  God is strong and will use means, but a mighty God doesn't need anyone else to carry out vengeance and wrath for him.

Nahum 1:3 (NIV) ''The L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt; is slow to anger and Quick to love; the L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt; will not leave the guilty unpunished.''

Nahum 1:7 (NIV) ''The L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt; is good, a refuge in times of trouble. He cares for those who trust in him''

== Importance ==

God's judgement on Ninevah is &quot;all because of the wanton lust of a harlot, alluring, the mistress of sorceries, who enslaved nations by her prostitution and peoples by her witchcraft.&quot; (Nahum 3:4 NIV).  Sexual infidelity, according to the prophets, related to spiritual unfaithfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Centre Column Reference Bible, (Nashville: Thomas Nelson Publishers, 1994) 1262&lt;/ref&gt; For example: ''the land is guilty of the vilest adultery in departing from the L&lt;small&gt;ORD&lt;/small&gt;.''(Hosea 1:2 NIV)  The apostle John used a similar analogy in Revelation chapter 17.

== Discourse ==

The book was introduced in Calvin's Commentary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Commentaries on Twelve Minor Prophets | url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom28.titlepage.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a complete and finished poem:

{{Quote|No one of the minor Prophets seems to equal the sublimity, the vehemence and the boldness of Nahum: besides, his Prophecy is a complete and finished poem; his exordium is magnificent, and indeed majestic; the preparation for the destruction of Nineveh, and the description of its ruin, and its greatness, are expressed in most vivid colors, and possess admirable perspicuity and fulness.|Rev. John Owen, translator|Calvin's Commentary on Jonah, Micah, Nahum}}

Nahum, taking words from Moses himself, have shown in a general way what sort of &quot;Being God is&quot;. The Reformation theologian Calvin argued, Nahum painted God by which  his nature must be seen, and &quot;it is from that most memorable vision, when God appeared to Moses after the breaking of the tables.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Calvin; Commentary on Jonah, Micah, Nahum http://onetenthblog.wordpress.com/readings/780-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

Nahum's writings could be taken as prophecy or as history. One account suggests that his writings are a prophecy written in about 615 BC, just before the downfall of Assyria, while another account suggests that he wrote this passage as liturgy just after its downfall in 612 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heaton, E. W. p. 35&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;abp&quot;/&gt; 

The book could be seen as an allusion to the history as described by Moses; for the minor Prophets, in promising God’s assistance to his people, must often remind how God in a miraculous manner brought up the Jews from Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Calvin's Commentary on Jonah, Micah, Nahum; Rev. John Owen, translator&lt;/ref&gt;
