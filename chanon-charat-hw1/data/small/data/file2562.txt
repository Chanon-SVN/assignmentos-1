'''''Big Brother''''' is a [[Reality television#Reality competition/game shows|reality game show]] franchise created by [[John de Mol]] and was originally based on a show from the Netherlands of the same name. The premise of the show is that there is a group of people, dubbed as &quot;housemates&quot; or &quot;houseguests&quot;, living together in a specially constructed large house. During their time in the house they are isolated from the outside world and are not commonly aware of outside events. Contestants are continuously monitored by in-house television cameras as well as personal audio microphones during their stay. Each series lasts for more than three months, with at least ten contestants entering the house. To win the final cash prize, a contestant must survive periodic (usually weekly) evictions and be the last housemate or houseguest remaining in the compound by the series' conclusion. English-language programmes are often referred to as &quot;BB&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel5.com/shows/big-brother/episodes?season=15706http:/www.channel5.com/shows/big-brother/episodes?season=15706 UK Channel 5 Web site, with many references to &quot;BB&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

===History===

The idea for ''Big Brother'' is said to have come during a brainstorming session at the Dutch-based international [[Italy|Italian]] television production firm [[Endemol]] on 10 March 1997. The first version of ''Big Brother'' was broadcast in 1999 on [[Veronica (TV channel)|Veronica]] in the [[Big Brother (Netherlands)|Netherlands]]. Since then the format has become a worldwide TV franchise, airing in many countries in a number of versions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nordicom 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nordicom.gu.se/sites/default/files/kapitel-pdf/42_011-022.pdf | title=New Media, New Options, New Communities? | publisher=''[[Nordicom]]'' | accessdate=23 May 2014 | author=Drotner, Kirsten | type=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although each country has made its own adaptations of the format, the contestants are confined to a specially-designed house where their every action is recorded by cameras and microphones and they are not permitted contact with the outside world. In most countries that have produced ''Big Brother'', the contestants have been known as &quot;housemates&quot;; however in the American and Canadian version they are referred to as &quot;houseguests&quot;. The term ''Big Brother'' originates from [[George Orwell]]'s novel, ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nordicom 1&quot;/&gt; Besides living together under continuous observation—which is the chief attraction of the contest, the program relies on four basic props: (1) the stripped-bare back-to-basics environment in which they live, (2) the evictions, (3) the weekly tasks and competitions set by ''Big Brother'' and (4) the &quot;Diary or Confession Room&quot; where housemates convey their thoughts, feelings, and frustrations, and reveal their nominees for eviction. Contestants are required to evict one of their own on a regular basis;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.endemol.com/programme/big-brother | title=Big Brother | publisher=''[[Endemol]]'' | accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the earlier series of ''Big Brother'', contestants were evicted every two weeks. However, the UK version introduced weekly evictions; almost all versions of ''Big Brother'' now follow this format.

At regular intervals, the housemates privately nominate a number of fellow housemates whom they wish evicted from the house. The housemates with the most nominations are then announced, and viewers are given the opportunity to [[televoting|vote via telephone]] for whom they wish to see evicted. Some more recent editions have since included more methods of voting, such as voting through social media and smartphone applications. The exceptions to this process are in the American and Canadian versions, in which the housemates vote to evict each other. After the votes are tallied, the &quot;evictee&quot; leaves the house and is interviewed by the host of the show. In some cases, two housemates may be evicted simultaneously (a &quot;double eviction&quot;); rarely, no housemates will be removed that week. At the end of the game, the last remaining housemate is declared the winner for the particular series and receives prizes (often including a large amount of money, a car, a vacation and—in some editions—a house).

In the first season of most series of ''Big Brother'', the house was very basic. Although essential amenities such as running water, furniture and a limited ration of food were provided, luxury items were often forbidden. This added a [[survivalist]] element to the show, increasing the potential for social tension. Nearly all later series provide a modern house for the contest with a jacuzzi, sauna, VIP suite, loft, and other luxuries.

The contestants are required to do housework, and are assigned tasks by the producers of the show (who communicate with the housemates via the omnipresent authority figure known to them only as &quot;Big Brother&quot;). The tasks are designed to test their teamwork abilities and community spirit; in some countries, the housemates' shopping budget or weekly allowance depends on the outcome of assigned tasks. The housemates have a weekly allowance, with which they can buy food and other essentials.

Most international versions of the show remain quite similar to each other; their main format remains true to the original [[fly on the wall]] observational style with the emphasis on human relationships, to the extent that contestants are forbidden from discussing nominations or voting strategy. Since 2001 the [[United States|US]] version adopted a different format from the others during its second season, where the contestants are encouraged to strategise to advance in the game. In this formats the contestants themselves vote to evict each other. In 2011, the [[United Kingdom|UK]] version controversially adapted the discussion of nominations before reverting this rule back after a poll by ''Big Brother'' broadcaster [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbspy.co.uk/bb13/features/0608/poll-big-brother-2012-housemates-discuss-nominations | title=POLL: Should housemates be able to talk nominations? | publisher=''BBSpy'' | date=8 June 2012 | accessdate=23 May 2014 | author=Scott, Matt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overview===
From a sociological and demographic perspective, ''Big Brother'' allows an analysis of how people react when forced into close confinement with people outside their [[comfort zone]] (with different opinions or ideals, or from a different socioeconomic group). The viewer has the opportunity to see how a person reacts from the outside (through the constant recording of their actions) and the inside (in the Diary or Confession Room). The Diary Room (more commonly known as the DR) is where contestants can privately express their feelings about the game, strategy and the other contestants. The results range from violent or angry confrontations to genuine and tender connections (often including romantic interludes).

The show is notable for involving the [[Internet]]. Although the show typically broadcasts daily updates during the evening (sometimes criticized for heavy editing by producers from viewers and former contestants alike&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/enforcement/broadcast-bulletins/obb110/issue110.pdf | title=Complaint by Ms Dawn Blake | author=Blake, Dawn | journal=[[Ofcom|Ofcom Broadcast Bulletin]] | year=2008 | month=27 | issue=110 | type=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;), viewers can also watch a continuous feed from multiple cameras on the Web in most countries. These websites were successful, even after some national series began charging for access to the video stream. In some countries, Internet broadcasting was supplemented by updates via email, [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] and [[Text messaging|SMS]]. The house is shown live on [[satellite television]], although in some countries there is a 10–15 minute delay to allow libelous or unacceptable content (such as references to people not participating in the program who have not consented to have personal information broadcast) to be removed.

Contestants occasionally develop sexual relationships; the level of sexual explicitness allowed to be shown in broadcast and Internet-feed vary on the country's broadcasting standards.

=== Isolation===
''Big Brother'' contestants are isolated in the house, without access to television, radio or the Internet; they are not permitted routine communication with the outside world. This was an important issue for most earlier series of the show. In more-recent series, contestants are occasionally allowed to view televised events (usually as a reward for winning at a task). In most versions of the program books and writing materials are also forbidden, although exceptions are sometimes made for religious materials such as the [[Bible]], [[Tanakh]] or the [[Qur'an]]. Some versions ban all writing implements, even items that can be used to write (such as lipstick or eyeliner). Despite the housemates' isolation, some contestants are occasionally allowed to leave the house as part of tasks. Contestants are permitted to leave the house in an emergency.

Contestants have regularly-scheduled interactions with the show's host on eviction nights. Throughout each day the program's producer, in the &quot;Big Brother&quot; voice, issues directives and commands to contestants. Some versions of the show allow private counseling sessions with a psychologist. These are allowed at any time, and are often conducted by telephone from the Diary Room.

==Format changes and twists==

Due to the intelligibility of certain languages across several nations, it has been possible to make regional versions of ''Big Brother''. All these follow the normal ''Big Brother'' rules, except that contestants must come from each of the countries in the region where it airs: ''[[Big Brother Africa]]'' of Africa (includes [[Angola]], [[Botswana]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Liberia]], [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], [[Namibia]], [[Nigeria]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[South Africa]], [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]], [[Zambia]], and [[Zimbabwe]]), [[Big Brother: The Boss|''Big Brother:'' الرئيس]] of the Middle East (includes [[Bahrain]], [[Egypt]], [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Oman]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Somalia]], [[Syria]], and [[Tunisia]]), ''[[Gran Hermano (Pacific)|Gran Hermano]]'' of South America (includes [[Chile]], [[Ecuador]], and [[Peru]]), ''[[Big Brother (Sweden and Norway)|Big Brother]]'' of Scandinavia (includes [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]), and ''[[Veliki brat 2011|Veliki brat]]'' of the Balkans (includes [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]).

===Multiple areas and houses===
In 2001, ''[[Big Brother (Netherlands)#Season 3|Big Brother 3]]'' of the Netherlands introduced &quot;Rich and Poor&quot; concept, wherein the house is separated into a luxurious half and a poor half and two teams of housemates fight for a place in the luxurious half. The Dutch version continued this concept until its [[Big Brother (Netherlands)#Season 4|fourth season]]. Other versions later followed and introduced a similar concept, of which some have their own twists: [[Big Brother Africa|Africa]] (in [[Big Brother Africa 5|2010]], [[Big Brother Africa 6|2011]], [[Big Brother Africa 7|2012]] and [[Big Brother Africa 8|2013]]), [[Big Brother (Albania)|Albania]] (in [[Big Brother 3 (Albania)|2010]]), [[Big Brother Australia|Australia]] (in [[Big Brother Australia 2003|2003]] and [[Big Brother 10 (Australia)|2013]]), [[Veliki Brat|Balkan States]] (in [[Veliki Brat VIP 4|VIP 2010]] and [[Veliki brat 2011|2011]]), [[Big Brother Brasil|Brazil]] (in [[Big Brother Brasil 9|2009]], [[Big Brother Brasil 10|2010]], [[Big Brother Brasil 11|2011]], [[Big Brother Brasil 13|2013]] and [[Big Brother Brasil 14|2014]]), [[Big Brother (Canada)|Canada]] ([[Big Brother 1 (Canada)|2013–present]]), [[Big Brother (Denmark)|Denmark]] (in [[Big Brother (Denmark)#Big Brother 3|2003]]), [[Big Brother (Finland)|Finland]] (in [[Big Brother 2009 (Finland)|2009]] and [[Big Brother 2014 (Finland)|2014]]), [[Big Brother Germany|Germany]] (in [[Big Brother Germany (Season 4)|2003]], [[Big Brother Germany (Season 5)|2004–2005]], [[Big Brother Germany (Season 6)|2005–2006]], [[Big Brother Germany (Season 8)|2008]] and [[Big Brother Germany (Season 9)|2008–2009]]), [[Big Brother (Greece)|Greece]] (in [[Big Brother (Greece)#Season 3|2003]]), [[Bigg Boss|India]] (in [[Bigg Boss 6|2012]] and [[Bigg Boss 7|2013]]), [[HaAh HaGadol|Israel]] (in [[HaAh HaGadol 2|2009]]), [[Grande Fratello|Italy]] (in [[Grande Fratello Season 6|2006]] and [[Grande Fratello Season 7|2007]]), [[Big Brother Norway|Norway]] (in [[Big Brother Norway#Big Brother 3 - Next Generation|2003]]), [[Pinoy Big Brother|Philippines]] (in [[Pinoy Big Brother: Double Up|2009]], [[Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition 3|Teen 2010]] and [[Pinoy Big Brother: Unlimited|2011]]), [[Big Brother (Poland)|Poland]] (in [[Big Brother (Poland)#Season 3|2002]]), [[Big Brother (Portugal)|Portugal]] (in [[Big Brother VIP (Portugal)|VIP 2013]]), [[Big Brother (Slovakia)|Slovakia]] (in [[Big Brother (Slovakia)|2005]]), [[Big Brother (Slovenia)|Slovenia]] (in [[Big Brother Slovenia Season 2|2008]]), [[Big Brother (Sweden and Norway)|Scandinavia]] (in [[Big Brother (Sweden and Norway)#Season one|2005]]), [[Big Brother (South Africa)|South Africa]] (in [[Big Brother Mzansi 3 (South Africa)|2014]]), [[Gran Hermano (Spain)|Spain]] (in [[Gran Hermano Spain (VIP Season 1)|VIP 2004]], [[Gran Hermano Spain (Season 10)|2008]], [[Gran Hermano Spain (Season 11)|2009–2010]] and [[Gran Hermano Spain (Season 12)|2010]]), [[Big Brother (UK)|United Kingdom]] (in [[Big Brother 3 (UK)|2002]], [[Celebrity Big Brother 5|Celebrity 2007]], [[Big Brother 9 (UK)|2008]] and [[Celebrity Big Brother 11|Celebrity 2013]]), and [[Big Brother (U.S.)|United States]] (in [[Big Brother 11 (U.S.)|2009–present]]).

In 2011-2012 (GH7), the Argentinian edition added &quot;La Casa de al Lado&quot; (&quot;The House Next Door&quot;), a smaller, more luxurious house which served multiple functions. The first week it hosted 4 potential housemates, and the public voted for two of them to enter the main house. The second week, two pairs of twins competed in the same fashion, with only one pair allowed in. Later, the 3rd, 4th and 5th evicted contestants were given the choice of staying on their way out, and they competed for the public's vote to reenter the house. Months later, after one of the contestants left the house voluntarily, the House Next Door reopened for four contestants who wanted to reenter and had not been in such playoff before. The House Next Door was also used in other occasions to allow contestants from the main house for limited periods of time, especially to have some more privacy (which of course could be seen by the public).&lt;ref&gt;http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anexo:S%C3%A9ptima_temporada_de_Gran_Hermano_%28Argentina%29#Casa_de_al_lado&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evil Big Brother===
In 2004, the [[Big Brother 5 (UK)|fifth series]] of the UK version introduced an evil Big Brother. Big Brother becomes villainous with harsher punishments, such as taking away prize money, more difficult tasks and secret tricks. This concept has also been used in [[Australia]], [[Belgium]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Croatia]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], the [[Netherlands]], [[South America]], [[Scandinavia]], [[Serbia]], [[Spain]], [[Thailand]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Mexico]].

=== Twin or triplet housemates ===
In 2004, the [[Big Brother 5 (U.S.)|fifth season]] of the US version introduced twins [[Adria Montgomery-Klein and Natalie Montgomery-Carroll]]. They were tasked to switch back and forth in the house. If they successfully changed places numerous times for five weeks without being caught, they could play the game as individual houseguests. This twin/triplet twist was used in several countries. Some made modifications in this said twist; others have had twins in the house together without this element of secrecy.

The following are the countries that have featured twins or triplets: Australia (in [[Big Brother Australia 2005|2005]]), Germany (in [[Big Brother Germany (Season 6)|2005-2006]]), Bulgaria (in [[Big Brother 3 (Bulgaria)|2006]] and [[Big Brother All Stars 2012 (Bulgaria)|2012]]), United Kingdom (in [[Big Brother 8 (UK)|2007]], [[Celebrity Big Brother 8|Celebrity 2011]], [[Celebrity Big Brother 9|Celebrity 2012]] and [[Big Brother 14 (UK)|2013]]), France (in [[Secret Story 2007 (France)|2007]], [[Secret Story 2011 (France)|2011]] and [[Secret Story 7 (France)|2013]]), Spain (in [[Gran Hermano Spain (season 9)|2007]] and [[Gran Hermano 14 (Spain)|2013]]), Poland (in [[Big Brother (Poland)#Season 4|2007]]), India (in [[Bigg Boss (Season 2)#Sana Wadiwala|2008]]), Africa (in [[Big Brother Africa 4|2009]]), Balkan Region (in [[Veliki brat 2009|2009]], [[Veliki Brat VIP 5|2013]]), Philippines (in [[Pinoy Big Brother: Double Up|2009]], [[Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition 4|Teen 2012]] and [[Pinoy Big Brother: All In|2014]]), Portugal (in [[Secret Story 2010 (Portugal)|2010]] and [[Secret Story 3 (Portugal)|2012]]), Israel (in [[HaAh HaGadol 3|2011]]), Ukraine (in [[Big Brother (Ukraine)|2011]]), Argentina (in [[Gran Hermano Argentina (season 7)|2011]]), and Albania (in [[Big Brother 6 (Albania)|2013]]).

===Secret missions===
The [[Big Brother 6 (UK)|sixth UK series]] introduced secret missions, where housemates could win luxuries if they completed a secret task set by Big Brother. The [[Big Brother 8 (UK)|eighth UK series]] saw an all-female house. However, two days later one male housemate arrived. The same twist was used in [[Bulgaria]] ([[Big Brother 4 (Bulgaria)|BB4]]). Africa ([[Big Brother Africa 4|BBA4]]) used a similar twist, with an all-male premiere.

===Opening night twists===
Since ''[[Big Brother 2 (UK)|Big Brother 2]]'', the [[Big Brother (UK)|UK series]] opens with a twist. This has included the public choosing the final housemate from three possibilities (''Big Brother 2''); public voting for a housemate to leave during the first week and the housemates choosing between two housemates with the least number of votes (''Big Brother 3''); first-night nominations (''[[Big Brother 4 (UK)|Big Brother 4]]''); suitcase nominations (''Big Brother 5''); Unlucky Housemate 13 (''Big Brother 6''); Big Brother Hood (''[[Big Brother 7 (UK)|Big Brother 7]]''); an all-female house and a set of twins as contestants (''[[Big Brother 2007 (UK)|Big Brother 8]]''); a couple entering as housemates, who must hide their relationship (''[[Big Brother 9 (UK)|Big Brother 9]]''); housemates having to earn housemate status (''[[Big Brother 10 (UK)|Big Brother 10]]''); a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] entering the house with an impossible task (''[[Big Brother 11 (UK)|Big Brother 11]]''); [[Jackie Stallone]] entering a house containing her son's ex-wife (''[[Celebrity Big Brother 3 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 3]]''); a non-celebrity in a celebrity edition (''[[Celebrity Big Brother 4 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 4]]'') and a visit from [[Jade Goody]]'s family (''[[Celebrity Big Brother 5 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 5]]''). During ''[[Celebrity Big Brother 6 (UK)|Celebrity Big Brother 6]]'' [[La Toya Jackson]] entered first, walked straight into a private bedroom (the bedrooms are usually locked until everyone has arrived) and put her bag on the bed to claim it as her own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2009/01/05/celebrity-big-brother-exclusive-la-toya-jackson-s-diva-demands-115875-21016252/ | title=Celebrity Big Brother exclusive: La Toya Jackson's diva demands - 3am &amp; Mirror Online | publisher=''[[Daily Mirror]]'' | date=25 January 2009 | accessdate=15 July 2013 | author=Bryant, Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terry Christian]] became head of the house which was used at the end of the previous non-celebrity series and had to nominate three housemates for the first eviction; the others voted to save one of the nominees, [[Ben Adams]], leaving [[Lucy Pinder]] and eventual winner [[Ulrika Jonsson]] to face the first eviction. In the summer series of 2009 the house was empty at first, with only crates to sit on. The new arrivals had to earn housemate status by completing tasks; Noirin Kelly was required to shave off her hair and draw a [[mustache]] and glasses on her face. Freddie Fisher and eventual winner Sophie Reade had to change their names by [[deed poll]] to Halfwit and Dogface. On day four, the six people who had not received housemate status were nominated for a public vote. The person with the fewest votes (Beinazir Lasharie) left, and the house was transformed into a &quot;Big Brother&quot; house. Other countries, such as Bulgaria, the United States and (previously) Australia, have also begun using opening-night twists.

===Fake evictions===
The fifth UK edition introduced fake evictions, where one or two housemates are &quot;evicted&quot;. In the eighth UK Series one housemate was evicted, interviewed and sent back into the house.

In the [[Pinoy Big Brother: All In|fifth Philippine ediion]], four housemates (Daniel, Manolo, Jane and Vickie) were fake evicted and stayed in a place called ''bodega''.

In [[Big Brother Australia 2013]] Benjamin 'Ben' Zabel was &quot;fake&quot; evicted on Day 50. He was removed  and put into the house's presidential suite, where he spent 24 hours without the other housemates knowing he was still in the house. He had immunity from eviction that week. After his 24 hours, Ben returned to the house.

In [[Big Brother Australia 2014]] Travis Lunardi was &quot;fake&quot; evicted and Ben who was fake evicted from the previous edition joined him for 24 hours to give him some advice. Travis Returned after 3 days total in the Sanctuary, a small private house with a pool, TV, DVDs, etc. Travis and Ben watched Ben's Favorite movie [[The Devil Wears Prada (film)|The Devil Wears Prada]] and Travis taught Ben to do a push-up. Like Ben from his fake eviction, Travis had immunity from eviction that week.

===Twists involving multi-franchises===

====Housemate exchanges====
In 2002, [[Mexico]] ([[Big Brother México#Big Brother 1|BBM1]]) and the [[Spain]] ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 3)|GH3]]) temporarily made housemate exchanges. Mexico's Eduardo Orozco swapped with Spain's Andrés Barreiro in 7 days. In 2010, the first 2-housemates exchange was held in [[Spain]] and [[Italy]]. Gerardo Prager and Saray Pereira from [[Gran Hermano Spain (season 11)|GH11]] of [[Spain]] was swapped with Carmela Gualtieri and Massimo Scattarella of [[Grande Fratello (season 10)|GF10]] of [[Italy]] for 7 days.

In later years, several housemate exchanges were done around the world: [[Argentina]] ([[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 3|GH3]]) and [[Spain]] ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 4)|GH4]]), [[Ecuador]] (GH1) and [[Mexico]] ([[Big Brother México#Big Brother 2|BBM2]]), and [[Africa]] ([[Big Brother Africa 1|BBA1]]) and [[United Kingdom]] ([[Big Brother 4 (UK)|BB4]]) in 2003; [[Scandinavia]] ([[Big Brother (Sweden and Norway)#Season two|BB2]]) and [[Thailand]] ([[Big Brother Thailand (season 2)|BBT2]]) in 2006; [[Philippines]] ([[Pinoy Big Brother (season 2)|PBB2]]) and [[Slovenia]] ([[Big Brother 1 (Slovenia)|BB1]]), and [[Argentina]] ([[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 5|GH5]]) and [[Spain]] ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 9)|GH9]]) in 2007; Africa ([[Big Brother Africa 3|BBA3]]) and [[Finland]] ([[Big Brother 2008 (Finland)|BB4]]) in 2008; [[Finland]] ([[Big Brother 2009 (Finland)|BB5]]) and [[Philippines]] ([[Pinoy Big Brother: Double Up|PBB3]]) in 2009; [[Finland]] ([[Big Brother 2010 (Finland)|BB6]]) and Slovenia ([[Big Brother Slavnih|BBS1]]) in 2010; [[Spain]] ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 12)|GH12]]) and [[Israel]] ([[HaAh HaGadol 3|HH3]]) in 2010 to 2011; [[Finland]] ([[Big Brother 2011 (Finland)|BB7]]) and [[Norway]] ([[Big Brother Norway#Big Brother 4|BB4]]) in 2011; and [[Argentina]] ([[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 7|GH7]]) and [[Israel]] ([[HaAh HaGadol 4|HH4]]) in 2012.

====Evicted housemate exchanges====
In 2003, [[Mexico]]'s Isabel Madow ([[Big Brother México#Big Brother VIP 2|BB VIP2]]) and [[Spain]]'s Aída Nízar ([[Gran Hermano Spain (season 5)|GH5]]) was swapped for 7 days. This twist was also done between [[Russia]] ([[Big Brother (Russia)|BBR1]]) and Pacific (GHP1) in 2005; and [[Argentina]] ([[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 4|GH4]]) and [[Brazil]] ([[Big Brother Brasil 7|BBB7]]) in 2007.

====Evicted housemate visits====
Anouska Golebiewski, an evicted housemate from [[United Kingdom]] (housemate from [[Big Brother 4 (UK)|BB4]]) visited [[Australia]] ([[Big Brother 3 (Australia)|BB3]]) in 2003. In 2005, [[United Kingdom]] (Nadia Almada of [[Big Brother 5 (UK)|BB5]]) visited [[Australia]] ([[Big Brother 5 (Australia)|BB5]]) again. In 2006, [[United Kingdom]] ([[Chantelle Houghton]] of [[Celebrity Big Brother 4|CBB4]]) visited [[Germany]] ([[Big Brother Germany (season 6)|BBG6]]). This twist was copied in later years by various other countries: Africa (Ricardo Ferreira of [[Big Brother Africa 3|BBA3]]) visited [[Brazil]] ([[Big Brother Brasil 9|BBB9]]) in 2009; [[Germany]] (Annina Ucatis and Sascha Schwan of [[Big Brother Germany (season 9)|BBG9]]) visited the [[Philippines]] ([[Pinoy Big Brother: Double Up|PBB3]]) in 2010, and [[Italy]] (George Leonard and Veronica Ciardi of [[Grande Fratello Season 10|GF10]]) visited [[Albania]] ([[Big Brother 3 (Albania)|BB3]]) in 2010; [[Sweden]] (Martin Granetoft and Peter OrrmyrSara Jonsson of [[Big Brother 2011 (Sweden)|BB5]]) visited [[Norway]] ([[Big Brother Norway#Big Brother 4|BB4]]) in 2011; [[Brazil]] (Rafael Cordeiro of [[Big Brother Brasil 12|BBB12]]) visited [[Spain]] ([[Gran Hermano 12 (Spain)|GH12]]), and [[Argentina]] (Agustín Belforte of [[Gran Hermano Argentina#Season 4|GH4]]) visited [[Colombia]] ([[Gran Hermano 2 (Colombia)|GH2]]) in 2012; [[United States]] (Dan Gheesling of [[Big Brother 10 (U.S.)|BB10]]/[[Big Brother 14 (U.S.)|BB14]]) visited [[Canada]] ([[Big Brother 1 (Canada)|BB1]] and the [[Big Brother 2 (Canada)|BB2]] Jury) in 2013; and [[Canada]] (Emmett Blois of [[Big Brother 1 (Canada)|BB1]]) visited [[South Africa]] ([[Big Brother Mzansi 3 (South Africa)|BBM3]]).

A similar event took place between the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] in 2014 wherein [[Rachel Reilly]] (from [[Big Brother 12 (U.S.)|BB12]]/[[Big Brother 13 (U.S.)|BB13]]) made a video chat to [[Canada]] ([[Big Brother 2 (Canada)|BB2]]). Rachel Reilly also appeared on Big Brother Canada's side show, which airs after the eviction episode once a week.

====Housemates competing in another country====
There were times that a former housemate from his franchise participated and competed in another foreign franchise: Daniela Martins of [[France]] (SS3) competed in [[Portugal]] (SS1); Daniel Mkongo of [[France]] (SS5) competed in [[Italy]] (GF12); [[Brigitte Nielsen]] of [[Denmark]] (BB VIP) competed in the [[United Kingdom]] (CBB3); [[Jade Goody]] of the [[United Kingdom]] (BB3, BB Panto, and CCB5) competed in [[India]] ([[Bigg Boss 2|BB2]]); Sava Radović of [[Germany]] (BB4) competed in the [[Balkan States]] (VB1); Nikola Nasteski of the [[Balkan States]] (VB4) competed in [[Bulgaria]] (BB All-Stars 1); Žarko Stojanović of [[France]] ([[Secret Story 5 (France)|SS5]]) competed in the [[Balkan States]] ([[Veliki Brat VIP 5|VB VIP5]]); Željko Stojanović of [[France]] ([[Secret Story 5 (France)|SS5]]) competed in the [[Balkan States]] ([[Veliki Brat VIP 5|VB VIP5]]); Kelly Baron of [[Brazil]] ([[Big Brother Brasil 13|BBB13]]) competed in [[Portugal]] ([[Big Brother VIP (Portugal)|BB VIP]]); [[Lucy Diakovska]] of [[Bulgaria]] ([[VIP Brother 4 (Bulgaria)|VIP B4]]) competed in [[Germany]] ([[Promi Big Brother (season 1)|PBB1]]); and Leila Ben Khalifa of [[Italy]] (GF6) competed in [[France]] (SS8).

====Other twists====
* '''Task visits:''' Cathrine Petersen and Henrik Andreassen  of [[Denmark]]'s [[Big Brother 4 (Denmark)|BB4]] and Patricia Andersen and Umar Nyonyintono of [[Sweden]]'s [[Big Brother 2012 (Sweden)|BB6]] visited each country's Big Brother Houses for 7 days in 2012.

This button was to be used when a contestant wanted to leave the house voluntarily, and it would fire an alarm in the whole house. When the alarm sound ceased, the contestant would be given five minutes to leave the house.&lt;ref&gt;http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anexo:S%C3%A9ptima_temporada_de_Gran_Hermano_%28Argentina%29#Bot.C3.B3n_rojo&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Telephone:''' Gran Hermano Argentina Series 4 (GH4) added a telephone in the living room. This telephone rang once a week for ten seconds, and if nobody picked up the call, the full house would be nominated for eviction. The first person to pick up the receiver was given an order or news from Big Brother, either to their benefit or against them. If an order was refused, they would be nominated for eviction.&lt;ref&gt;http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anexo:Cuarta_temporada_de_Gran_Hermano_%28Argentina%29#Cambios_en_el_Juego&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
In Germany, a new sixth-season version of the show was ''Big Brother - Das Dorf'' (''Big Brother - The Village''). The season ended after 363 days in February 2006 because of low ratings. For season seven, RTL II switched back to a traditional version. The fourth Greek season introduced a mother. During the tenth week of the seventh UK season, the housemates were paired with their &quot;best friend&quot; in the house and had to nominate and face eviction as couples. The [[Big Brother 9 (U.S.)|ninth American season]] added a romantic aspect by pairing up the housemates up and having them compete as couples.

The [[Big Brother Brasil 9|ninth Brazilian season]] featured the &quot;Bubble&quot;: a glass house in a [[shopping mall]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] where four potential housemates lived for a week. Later in the season a bubble was built inside the Big Brother house, with another two housemates living in it for a week until they were voted in and the glass house dismantled.

A familiar twist occurred in the [[Pinoy Big Brother: Celebrity Edition 2|second celebrity edition]] of the Philippine version, where two housemates related by profession or family played as one. Also in the Philippine version, the second season of the [[Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition Plus|teen edition]], also featured the parents/guardians of the teens that are staying in the house. The parents had their own living quarters and were considered as housemates. If a teen housemate was evicted, the coinciding parent/guardian would also be evicted. In ''[[Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack|Celebrity Hijack UK]]'' evicted housemates were given the opportunity to choose if a &quot;ninja&quot; delivered good or bad gifts to the house. Later that year ''[[Big Brother Australia 2008]]'' introduced the Housemate Hand Grenade, where an evicted housemate decided which housemate received a penalty. ''[[Big Brother 5 (Bulgaria)|Big Brother 5]]'' of [[Bulgaria]], which began in early 2010, introduced a new family format (Big Brother Family). Whole families entered the house with their spouses, children and relatives. They received a salary for their stay and the winning family received a cash prize, a car and an apartment. [[Big Brother 11 (U.S.)|The eleventh American season]] featured Pandora's Box, in which the winning head of household was tempted (with money, a celebrity visit or time alone with a loved one) to open a box. If an HoH chooses to open Pandora's Box, however, there may be unintended consequences.

[[Big Brother 12 (U.S.)|The twelfth American season]] featured a saboteur, who entered the house to wreak havoc with tasks suggested by viewers. ''[[Big Brother Africa 6]]'' in 2011 was the first season of Big Brother to have two winners, each getting $200,000. [[Big Brother 13 (U.S.)|The thirteenth American season]] introduced Dynamic Duos, where eight new houseguests would enter the house with three duos from past seasons. The [[Pinoy Big Brother: Unlimited|fourth Philippine season]] featured ''Unli-Day'' and ''Unli-Night'', where two separate groups of housemates were covered in two separate programs. It also introduced reserved housemates, shortlisted auditioners who were given a chance to be a housemate by completing tasks assigned by Big Brother (this was also done in Argentina's [[Gran Hermano Argentina (season 7)|seventh season]]). The [[Pinoy Big Brother|Philippine version]] introduced the 100-second session, in which housemates are given a chance to be with their loved ones for only 100 seconds in the Confession Room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bb1.pinoybigbrother.com/Default.aspx?tabid=52&amp;articleType=ArticleView&amp;articleId=184 | title=Housemate to Have a 100-Second Reunion Tonight | publisher=''[[Pinoy Big Brother]]'' | date=11 November 2005 | accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Big Brother 14 (U.S.)|The fourteenth American season]] had four houseguests from past seasons returning to the house to coach twelve new houseguests. The four returning houseguests played their own game for a separate prize of $100,000 until they joined the normal game later after a reset twist. [[Big Brother 15 (U.S.)|The fifteenth American season]] Introduced the Big Brother M.V.P twist where every week, the viewers would vote one of the houseguests who the viewers thought was playing the best game, also introduced three nominations in the US version where the HOH would nominate the first two houseguests for eviction (like in previous seasons) while the 3rd nomination is made by the M.V.P of that week in a further twist for the M.V.P, the viewers decided who the 3rd nominee would be for the week, half way into the season the M.V.P twist ended and the show continued on with just 2 nominees a week as in previous seasons.

In the [[Big Brother Brasil 14|fourteenth Brazilian season]], 7 mothers and 2 aunts, relatives of the 9 remaining housemates, entered the Big Brother Brasil house to celebrate [[International Women's Day]]. The housemates could not see or touch their relatives because the house was divided by a wall. An improvised house was assembled for the mothers and aunts. They stayed in the house for 6 days.

[[Big Brother 16 (U.S.)|The sixteenth American season]] featured two Head of Household every week and had four HouseGuests nominated for eviction. While, in previous seasons, the HoH has guaranteed immunity until the next eviction, this was not the case due to a new competition called &quot;Battle of the Block,&quot; in which the two sets of nominees compete to save themselves. The winning pair of nominees are removed from the block while dethroning the HoH who nominated them; while the Battle of the Block winners were ineligible to be named the replacement nominee if the Veto is used, the dethroned HoH is not. Another new twist introduced was &quot;Team America,&quot; an alliance of three HouseGuests selected by the voting public tasked with completing secret missions; each member received $5000 per each successfully completed mission.

==Special editions==

===''Celebrity'' and ''VIP'' Big Brother===
The ''Big Brother'' format has been adapted in some countries; the housemates are local celebrities, and the shows are called ''Celebrity Big Brother'' or ''Big Brother VIP''. In some countries, the prize money normally awarded to the winning housemate is donated to a charity, and all celebrities are paid to appear in the show as long as they do not voluntarily leave before their eviction or the end of the series. The rest of the rules are nearly the same as those of the original version. The celebrity version has become particularly popular in the UK, causing UK broadcaster Channel 5 to extend its deal with Endemol enabling them to air two celebrity series in addition to the civilian version every year from 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://trashlounge.co.uk/8572/celebrity-big-brother-to-air-twice-a-year-in-updated-channel-5-deal/ | title=Celebrity Big Brother to air twice a year in updated Channel 5 deal | publisher=''Trash Lounge'' | date=12 February 2012 | accessdate=24 May 2014 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120213224220/http://trashlounge.co.uk/8572/celebrity-big-brother-to-air-twice-a-year-in-updated-channel-5-deal/ | archivedate=13 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; again in 2013 and again in 2014, with the first of the two series having already aired this year (the first being in January and the second after the main series in the summer).

====Variations====
The 2006 Netherlands series was entitled ''Hotel Big Brother''. This variation introduced a group of celebrity hoteliers and a Big Boss, who run a hotel and collect money for charity without nominations, evictions or a winner.

Another variation appeared in the UK in early 2008, entitled ''Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack''. This temporarily replaced the 2007 ''Celebrity Big Brother'' in the wake of a racial-abuse incident. Instead of celebrities playing housemates the celebrities became Big Brother himself, creating tasks and holding nominations with the help of Big Brother. The housemates were considered by the producers &quot;Britain's most exceptional and extraordinary&quot; 18- to 21-year-olds. The prize for the winner of the series was £50,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;celebhijack&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/B/bb8/news/newsstory.jsp?id=24561 | title=BB Celebrity Hijack - NEWS | publisher=''[[Channel 4]]'' | accessdate=24 May 2014 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070621073443/http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/B/bb8/news/newsstory.jsp?id=24561 | archivedate=21 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 ''[[VIP Brother 3 (Bulgaria)|VIP Brother 3 Bulgaria]]'' introduced the concept of celebrities competing for charitable causes, sometimes allowed to leave the house to raise money for the charity (which changed each week).

===US and English Canadian version===
{{Details3|[[Big Brother (U.S.)]] and [[Big Brother Canada]]|these Big Brother versions}} 
The United States' and Canada's version of Big Brother is different from most versions of the series. The American series began in 2000 with a format much similar to the international format, however, due to poor ratings and the strong popularity of ''[[Survivor (U.S. TV series)|Survivor]]'', beginning in the [[Big Brother 2 (U.S.)|second season]], a highly gameplay-oriented format was implemented where the contestants are encouraged to strategize and form alliances with others to improve their chance at winning. For this new format, a group of 12 to 16 contestants, known as &quot;houseguests,&quot; compete to win the series by voting each other off and being the last houseguest remaining. One houseguest, known as the Head of Household (HoH), must nominate two of their fellow houseguests for eviction. The winner of the Power of Veto (PoV, introduced in the 3rd American season) has the option to save one of the nominees for eviction, forcing the HoH to nominate another houseguest in his or her place. The houseguests then vote to evict one of the nominees, and the houseguest with the most votes is evicted. When only two houseguests remain, the most recently evicted houseguests (generally 7) form The Jury and decide which of the two remaining houseguests would win the grand prize.

In 2013, English-speaking Canada began its own version based on the US version, but the viewing audience are given more control of the game. Secret tasks were also introduced and are usually presented by the show's mascot &quot;Marsha the Moose&quot; . These two elements cause fans of the show to call it a hybrid of the U.S edition and the U.K/international editions.

Elements of this format (such as having one contestant winning the position of or similar to Head of Household or allowing contestants to talk and strategize about the nomination/eviction process) have been adapted in other editions of the show, notably the [[Big Brother (Quebec)|French Canadian version]], where the format was followed almost exactly, but the public could evict a housemate on some occasions, and eventually decided the winner in the end.

===Other editions===
The ''Big Brother'' format has been otherwise modified in some countries:
* ''''' Big Brother: All-Stars''''' (Belgium, 21 days; [[Bulgaria]]: Season 1–3, 27-29 days; [[United States]], 72 days; [[United Kingdom]], 18 days; [[Canada]], 64 days; [[Africa]], 91 days; [[Spain]], 56 days; [[Portugal]] ''Secret Story'': Season 1–3, 22-29 days): Previous housemates from previous seasons compete.
* '''''Big Brother: Reality All-Stars''''' ([[Sweden]], 6 days; [[Denmark]], 32 days; [[Spain]], 56 days): Contestants from different reality shows, including ''Big Brother'', compete.
* '''''Big Brother: You Decide / Big Brother: Back in the House / Big Brother: Try Out''''' ([[Poland]]: Season 1–2, 7–13 days; [[Norway]], 9 days; [[Serbia]], 7 days): Housemates, new or old, compete for a spot in the next regular season without nominations or evictions.

* '''''[[Teen Big Brother: The Experiment|{{font color|black|Teen Big Brother}}]]''''' ([[United Kingdom]], 10 days; [[Philippines]]: Season 1–4, 42–91 days): Teen aged 13 and older compete.

* '''''[[Pinoy Big Brother: All In|{{font color|black|Big Brother: All In}}]]''''' ([[Pinoy Big Brother: All In|Philippines]], 120 days): A group of mixed housemates containing teenagers, regular adults, and celebrities compete in one season.

* '''''[[Secret Story (disambiguation)|{{font color|black|Secret Story}}]]''''' ([[France]], [[Lithuania]], [[Portugal]], [[Netherlands]] and [[Peru]]): Each housemate has a secret.

* '''''[[Big Brother Panto (UK)|{{font color|black|Big Brother Panto}}]]''''' ([[United Kingdom]], 11 days): Housemates from previous series spent time in the Big Brother House to perform a [[pantomime]] at the series' end.

There are also &quot;test runs&quot;, with a group of celebrities (or journalists) living in the house for several days to test it. There are occasions where people who have auditioned for the show are also put in the house, most notably in the British edition, where many housemates claim to have met before. These series have been televised in [[Argentina]], Bulgaria, the [[Czech Republic]], Germany, Mexico, the Pacific region, the Philippines, and Spain. In some cases, it is not broadcast, but in others, such as the U.S. edition, it is used as a promotional tool.

==Versions==
Through 1 January 2015, ''Big Brother'' has produced 337 winners in over 53 franchises. The most recent winner is Elisabete Moutinho from [[Secret Story 5 (Portugal)|Portugal]].

==Controversies==

===Stolen concept===
In April 2000, Castaway, an independent production company, filed a lawsuit against John de Mol and Endemol for stealing the concepts of their own show called ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survive!]]'', a reality television show where contestants are placed in a deserted island and will have to take care of themselves alone. These contestants were also filmed by cameras around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/720966.stm | title=Geldof's Big Brother battle | publisher=''[[BBC News]]'' | date=20 April 2000 | accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court later dismissed the lawsuit filed by Castaway against de Mol and Endemol. The ''Survive!'' reality television format was later turned into ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/893180.stm | title=Blow for mogul's Big Brother claim | publisher=''[[BBC News]]'' | date=24 August 2000 | accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
