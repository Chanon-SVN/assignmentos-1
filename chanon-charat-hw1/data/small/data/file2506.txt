'''Benjamin''' was the last-born of [[Jacob]]'s thirteen children (12 sons 1 daughter), and the second and last son of [[Rachel]] in [[Jewish]], [[Christian]] and [[Islamic]] [[tradition]]. He was the progenitor of the [[Israelites|Israelite]] [[Tribe of Benjamin]]. In the Biblical account, unlike Rachel's first son, [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], Benjamin was born in [[Canaan]].  In the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]], Benjamin's name appears as &quot;Binyaamem&quot; ({{Hebrew name 1 | ࠁࠍࠉࠌࠉࠌ | &quot;Son of my days&quot;}}). In the [[Qur'an]], Benjamin is referred to as righteous young child, who remained with Jacob when the older brothers plotted against Joseph. Later rabbinic traditions name him as one of four ancient Israelites who died without sin, the other three being [[Chileab]], [[Jesse]] and [[Amram]].{{cn|date=December 2014}}

==Name==
[[Image:Benjamin2.JPG|thumb|left|Portuguese sketch]]
According to the [[Torah]], Benjamin's name arose when Jacob deliberately corrupted the name ''Benoni'', the original name of ''Benjamin'', since ''Benoni'' was an allusion to Rachel's [[Maternal death|dying just after she had given birth]], as it means ''son of my pain''.&lt;ref&gt;Genesis 35:19&lt;/ref&gt; Textual scholars regard these two names as fragments of naming narratives coming from different sources - one being the [[Jahwist]] and the other being the [[Elohist]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Elliott Friedman]], ''Who wrote the Bible?''&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[etymology]] of the name interpreted as ''son of the right side''. Being associated with the right hand side was traditionally a reference to strength and virtue (cf ''[[wikt:sinister|sinister]]'', which derives from the [[latin]] for ''left''). This is, however, not the only literal translation, as the [[root word|root]] for ''right'' is identical to that for ''south'', hence ''Benjamin'' also literally translates as ''son of the south''. This meaning is advocated by several [[classical rabbinical literature|classical rabbinical sources]], which argue that it refers to the birth of Benjamin in [[Canaan]], as compared with the birth of all the other sons of Jacob in [[Aram-Naharaim|Aram]].&lt;ref name = &quot;bdmtze&quot;&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern scholars have instead proposed that, with the eponymous Benjamin being just a metaphor, ''son of the south'' / ''son of the right'' are references to the tribe's  being subordinate to the more dominant tribe of Ephraim.&lt;ref name = &quot;bdmtze&quot;/&gt;

Inside the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]], the name is consistently written as '''בן ימים''', with a terminal [[mem]], making it ''Benjamim'', and would literally translate as ''spirit man''. Some [[classical rabbinical literature]] argues that this was the original form of the name and was a reference to the advanced age of Jacob when Benjamin was born.&lt;ref name = &quot;bdmtze&quot;/&gt;

According to classical rabbinical sources, Benjamin was only born after [[Rachel]] had [[fasted]] for a long time, as a religious devotion with the hope of a new child as a reward. By then [[Jacob]] had become over 100 years old.&lt;ref name = &quot;bdmtze&quot;/&gt; Benjamin is treated as a young child in most of the Biblical narrative,&lt;ref name = &quot;bdmtze&quot;/&gt; but at one point is abruptly described as the father of ten sons.&lt;ref name = &quot;xhbyqx&quot;&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|46:21|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Textual scholars believe that this is the result of the genealogical passage, in which his children are named, being from a much later source than the [[Jahwist]] and [[Elohist]] narratives, which make up most of the [[Joseph]] narrative, and which consistently describe Benjamin as a child.&lt;ref name = &quot;bdmtze&quot;/&gt;

==Israelites in Egypt==

The Torah's Joseph narrative, at a stage when Joseph is unrecognised by his brothers, describes Joseph as testing whether his brothers have reformed by secretly planting a silver cup in Benjamin's bag, then publicly searching the bags for it, and after ''finding'' it in Benjamin's possession, demanding that Benjamin become his [[slave]] as a punishment.&lt;ref name=Gen44&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|44|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative goes on to state that when [[Judah (Biblical figure)|Judah]] (on behalf of the other brothers) begged Joseph not to enslave Benjamin and instead enslave him, since enslavement of Benjamin would break Jacob's heart. This caused Joseph to recant and reveal his identity.&lt;ref name=Gen44/&gt; The [[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|midrashic book of Jasher]] argues that prior to revealing his identity, Joseph asked Benjamin to find his missing brother (i.e. Joseph) via [[astrology]], using an [[astrolabe]]-like tool;&lt;ref name = &quot;bdmtze&quot;&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia''&lt;/ref&gt; it continues by stating that Benjamin [[divination|divined]] that the ''man on the throne'' was Joseph, so Joseph identified himself to Benjamin (but not the other brothers), and revealed his scheme (as in the Torah) to test how fraternal the other brothers were.&lt;ref name = &quot;bdmtze&quot;/&gt; However, some classical rabbinical sources argue that Joseph identified himself for other reasons.&lt;ref name = &quot;bdmtze&quot;/&gt; In these sources, Benjamin swore an oath, on the memory of Joseph, that he was innocent of theft, and, when challenged about how believable the oath would be, explained that remembering Joseph was so important to him that he had named his sons in Joseph's honour;&lt;ref name = &quot;bdmtze&quot;/&gt; these sources go on to state that Benjamin's oath touched Joseph so deeply that Joseph was no longer able to pretend to be a stranger.&lt;ref name = &quot;bdmtze&quot;/&gt;

In the narrative, just prior to this test, when Joseph had first met all of his brothers (but not identified himself to them), he had held a feast for them;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|43|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; the narrative heavily implies that Benjamin was Joseph's favorite brother, since he is overcome with tears when he first meets Benjamin in particular,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|43:30|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he gives Benjamin five times as much food as he apportions to the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|43:34|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to textual scholars, this is really the Jahwist's account of the reunion after Joseph identifies himself, and the account of the threat to enslave Benjamin is just the Elohist's version of the same event, with the Elohist being more terse about Joseph's emotions towards Benjamin, merely mentioning that Benjamin was given five times as many gifts as the others.&lt;ref name = &quot;bdmtze&quot;/&gt;

==Benjamin in Islam==
The [[Qur'an]], in the narrative of [[Islamic view of Joseph|Joseph]], refers to Benjamin as the righteous youngest son of [[Jacob]].&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an XII: 8, 59-79&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islamic]] [[tradition]], however, does  not provide much detail regarding Benjamin's life and refers to him as being born from Jacob's wife [[Rachel]], and further links a connection, as does [[Jewish]] [[tradition]], between the names of Benjamin's children and Joseph.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Islam'', Vol. I, ''Binyamin'', A.J. Wensick/G. Vajda&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[Image:Kever Binyamin.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Exterior view of a [[Mamluk]] [[Caravanserai]] complex, including the mausoleum of Nabi Yamin, traditionally believed to be the tomb of Benjamin, located outside [[Kfar Saba]], [[Israel]].]]

Biblical scholars regard it as obvious, from their geographic overlap and their treatment in older passages, that originally Ephraim and Manasseh were considered one tribe, that of ''Joseph''.&lt;ref name = &quot;gzuhsh&quot;&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''Ephraim''&lt;/ref&gt; According to several biblical scholars, Benjamin was also originally part of this single tribe, but the biblical account of Joseph as his father became lost.&lt;ref name = &quot;gzuhsh&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;fxeide&quot;&gt;''[[Peake's commentary on the Bible]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The description of Benjamin being born after the arrival in Canaan is thought by some scholars to refer to the tribe of Benjamin coming into existence by branching from the Joseph group after the tribe had settled in Canaan.&lt;ref name = &quot;fxeide&quot;/&gt; A number of biblical scholars suspect that the distinction of the ''Joseph tribes'' (including Benjamin) is that they were the only Israelites which went to [[Egypt]] [[the Exodus|and returned]], while the main Israelite tribes simply emerged as a subculture from the Canaanites and had remained in [[Canaan]] throughout.&lt;ref name = &quot;fxeide&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Israel Finkelstein]], ''The Bible Unearthed''&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, the story of Jacob's visit to [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]] to obtain a wife originated as a [[metaphor]] for this migration, with the property and family which were gained from Laban representing the gains of the Joseph tribes by the time they returned from [[Egypt]];&lt;ref name = &quot;fxeide&quot;/&gt; according to [[textual criticism|textual scholars]], the [[Jahwist]] version of the Laban narrative only mentions the Joseph tribes, and Rachel, and does not mention the other tribal [[matriarch]]s whatsoever.&lt;ref name = &quot;fxeide&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Elliott Friedman]], ''Who Wrote the Bible?''&lt;/ref&gt;
