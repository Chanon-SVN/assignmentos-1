The '''Bastard Operator From Hell''' ('''BOFH''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] rogue [[system administrator]] who takes out his anger on [[user (computing)|user]]s (often referred to as [[luser]]s), colleagues, bosses, and anyone else who pesters him with their computer problems. Several people have written stories about BOFHs, but the canonical one is created by '''Simon Travaglia'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;JF&quot; /&gt; The BOFH stories were originally posted in 1992 to [[Usenet]] by Travaglia, with some being reprinted in [[Datamation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were published weekly from 1995 to 1999 in [[Network Week]]{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} and since 2000 they have been published regularly in [[The Register]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/Author/1541/Simon%20Travaglia Simon Travaglia], The Register, accessed 18 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Several books of the stories have also been released.

By extension, the term is also used to refer to any system administrator who displays (or wishes he could get away with) the qualities of the original,&lt;ref name=&quot;JF&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Eric S.|last=Raymond |title=[[The New Hacker's Dictionary]]|isbn=978-0-262-68092-9|year=1996|publisher=The MIT Press|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/security/2008/09/the-bofh-lives-88-of-it-workers-would-steal-data-if-fired/|title=The BOFH lives: 88% of IT workers would steal data if fired|last=Paul|first=Ryan|work=[[Ars Technica]]|date=2008-09-08|accessdate=2014-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming common [[Internet slang]].

The early editions of the BOFH took place in a university, later moving on to an office workplace over time. The stories of 2000 (BOFH 2k) began with the BOFH and his pimply-faced youth (PFY) assistant moving to a new company.

== Characteristics of the BOFH ==
{{original research section|date=December 2014}}

The BOFH employs a system wherein the users are constantly decieved and manipulated at his will. Attempts to break this system or uncover it are met with blackmail or termination of employment (accomplished by various techniques). The same punishment is sometimes exacted on users who are especially annoying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bofh.ntk.net/BOFH/1995/bastard95-06.php|title = Bastard Operator from Hell Official Archive: The B.O.F.H. wreaks his revenge ...|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Travaglia|first = Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bastard also enjoys wasting research fund money by going on junkets with the boss,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bofh.ntk.net/BOFH/1995/bastard95-02.php|title = Bastard Operator from Hell Official Archive: The Bastard trips up...|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = Travaglia|first = Simon}}&lt;/ref&gt; or spending time in the pub with the PFY.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bofh.ntk.net/BOFH/1997/bastard97-04.php|title = Bastard Operator from Hell Official Archive: Someone's found out where the 'liberated' phones go.
