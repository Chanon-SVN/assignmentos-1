'''''Blade Runner''''' is a 1982 American [[neo-noir]] dystopian [[science fiction film]] directed by [[Ridley Scott]] and starring [[Harrison Ford]], [[Rutger Hauer]], [[Sean Young]], and [[Edward James Olmos]]. The screenplay, written by [[Hampton Fancher]] and [[David Peoples]], is a modified [[film adaptation]] of the 1968 novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' by [[Philip K. Dick]].

The film depicts a [[dystopian]] Los Angeles in November 2019, in which genetically engineered [[replicant]]s, which are visually indistinguishable from adult humans, are manufactured by the powerful Tyrell Corporation as well as by other &quot;mega-corporations&quot; around the world. Their use on Earth is banned and replicants are exclusively used for dangerous, menial, or leisure work on [[Space colonization|off-world colonies]]. Replicants who defy the ban and return to Earth are hunted down and &quot;retired&quot; by special police operatives known as &quot;Blade Runners&quot;. The plot focuses on a desperate group of recently escaped replicants hiding in Los Angeles and the burnt-out expert Blade Runner, [[Rick Deckard]] (Harrison Ford), who reluctantly agrees to take on one more assignment to hunt them down.

''Blade Runner'' initially polarized critics: some were displeased with the pacing, while others enjoyed its thematic complexity. The film performed poorly in North American theaters but has since become a [[cult film]].&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. xvi–xviii&lt;/ref&gt; It has been hailed for its production design, depicting a &quot;[[retrofitted]]&quot; future,&lt;ref&gt;Bukatman, p. 21; Sammon, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; and remains a leading example of the neo-noir genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.kentuckypress.com/live/title_detail.php?titleid=1113 | title= The Philosophy of Neo-Noir | publisher=University Press of Kentucky | accessdate=July 27, 2011 | last=Conard | first=Mark T. | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-8131-2422-3| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140407034434/http://www.kentuckypress.com/live/title_detail.php?titleid=1113 | archivedate=2014-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It brought the work of Philip K.

''Blade Runner'' is now regarded as one of the [[Films considered the greatest ever#Particular genres or media|best science fiction films ever made]].

Seven versions of the film have been shown for various markets as a result of controversial changes made by film executives. A rushed ''[[Director's Cut]]'' was released in 1992 after a strong response to [[workprint]] screenings. This, in conjunction with its popularity as a video rental, made it one of the first films released on DVD, resulting in a basic disc with mediocre video and audio quality.&lt;ref name=&quot;hunt&quot;&gt;{{citation | last1=Hunt | first1=Bill | date=December 12, 2007 | url=http://www.thedigitalbits.com/site_archive/reviewshd/bladerunnerfinalallver01.html | title=Blade Runner: The Final Cut – All Versions | publisher=The Digital Bits, Inc. | accessdate=July 27, 2011| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140222044932/http://www.thedigitalbits.com/site_archive/reviewshd/bladerunnerfinalallver01.html | archivedate=2014-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[Warner Bros.]] released ''[[Versions of Blade Runner#The Final Cut (2007)|The Final Cut]]'', a 25th anniversary digitally remastered version which is the only one on which Scott had complete artistic freedom&lt;ref name=&quot;Sammon, pp. 353, 365&quot;&gt;Sammon, pp. 353, 365&lt;/ref&gt; and was shown in select theaters and subsequently released on DVD, [[HD DVD]], and [[Blu-ray Disc]].&lt;ref name=&quot;thedigitalbits&quot;&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.thedigitalbits.com/site_archive/articles/br2007/announce.html | title=Blade Runner: The Final Cut | publisher=The Digital Bits, Inc. | date=July 26, 2007 | accessdate=July 27, 2011| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140222043104/http://www.thedigitalbits.com/site_archive/articles/br2007/announce.html | archivedate=2014-02-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{Hatnote|Note: There are several [[versions of Blade Runner|versions of ''Blade Runner'']], this summary excludes version specific events.}}

In Los Angeles, November 2019, retired police officer [[Rick Deckard]] ([[Harrison Ford]]) is detained by officer [[Characters in Blade Runner#Gaff|Gaff]] ([[Edward James Olmos]]) and brought to his former supervisor, [[Characters in Blade Runner#Harry Bryant|Bryant]] ([[M. Emmet Walsh]]). Deckard, whose job as a &quot;Blade Runner&quot; was to track down bioengineered beings known as [[replicant]]s and destroy them, is informed that four have come to Earth illegally. As Tyrell Corporation Nexus-6 models, they have only a four-year lifespan and may have come to Earth to try to extend their lives.

Deckard watches a video of a Blade Runner named Holden administering the &quot;Voight-Kampff&quot; test designed to distinguish replicants from humans based on their emotional response to questions. The test subject, [[Characters in Blade Runner#Leon Kowalski|Leon]] ([[Brion James]]), shoots Holden after Holden asks about Leon's mother. Bryant wants Deckard to retire Leon and the other replicants: [[Characters in Blade Runner#Roy Batty|Roy Batty]] ([[Rutger Hauer]]), [[Characters in Blade Runner#Zhora|Zhora]] ([[Joanna Cassidy]]), and [[Characters in Blade Runner#Pris|Pris]] ([[Daryl Hannah]]). Deckard initially refuses, but after Bryant ambiguously threatens him, he reluctantly agrees.

Deckard begins his investigation at the Tyrell Corporation to ensure that the test works on Nexus-6 models. While there, he discovers that [[Characters in Blade Runner#Dr. Eldon Tyrell|Dr. Eldon Tyrell's]] ([[Joe Turkel]]) assistant [[Characters in Blade Runner#Rachael|Rachael]] ([[Sean Young]]) is an experimental replicant who believes herself to be human. Rachael has been given false memories to provide an &quot;emotional cushion&quot;. As a result, a more extensive test is required to determine whether she is a replicant.

Events are then set into motion that pit Deckard's search for the replicants against their search for Tyrell to force him to extend their lives. Roy and Leon investigate a replicant eye-manufacturing laboratory and learn of [[Characters in Blade Runner#J.F. Sebastian|J.F. Sebastian]] ([[William Sanderson]]), a gifted designer who works closely with Tyrell. Rachael visits Deckard at his apartment to prove her humanity by showing him a family photo, but after Deckard reveals that her memories are only implants taken from a real person, she leaves his apartment in tears. Meanwhile, Pris locates Sebastian and manipulates him to gain his trust.

While searching Leon's hotel room, Deckard finds a photo of Zhora and a synthetic snake scale that leads him to a strip club where Zhora works. Deckard kills Zhora and shortly after is told by Bryant to also kill Rachael, who has absconded from the Tyrell Corporation. Deckard spots Rachael in a crowd but is attacked by Leon. Rachael kills Leon using Deckard's gun, and the two return to Deckard's apartment, where he promises not to hunt her. Later they share an intimate moment; Rachael abruptly tries to leave, but Deckard physically restrains her and forces Rachael to kiss him.

Arriving at Sebastian's apartment, Roy tells Pris the others are dead. Sympathetic to their plight, Sebastian reveals that because of a genetic disorder that accelerates his aging, his life will also be cut short. Sebastian and Roy gain entrance into Tyrell's secure penthouse, where Roy demands more life from his maker. Tyrell tells him that it is impossible. Roy confesses that he has done &quot;questionable things&quot; which Tyrell dismisses, praising Roy's advanced design and accomplishments in his short life. Roy kisses Tyrell, then kills him. Sebastian runs for the elevator followed by Roy, who then rides the elevator down alone.

Upon entering Sebastian's apartment, Deckard is ambushed by Pris, but manages to kill her just as Roy returns. As Roy's body begins to shut down, he chases Deckard through the building and ends up on the roof. Deckard tries to jump to another roof, but misses and is left hanging precariously between the buildings. Roy makes the jump with ease, and as Deckard's grip loosens, Roy hoists him onto the roof, saving him. As his life runs out, Roy delivers [[Tears in rain monologue|a monologue]] about how his memories are about to be lost; Roy dies in front of Deckard, who watches silently. Gaff arrives and shouts to Deckard, &quot;It's too bad she won't live, but then again, who does?&quot; Deckard returns to his apartment to find Rachael sleeping in his bed. As they leave, Deckard finds a small tin-foil [[origami]] unicorn, a calling card left by Gaff. Depending on the version, Deckard and Rachael either leave the apartment block to an uncertain future, or drive through an idyllic pastoral landscape.

Although ''Blade Runner'' is ostensibly an action film, it operates on multiple dramatic and narrative levels. It is indebted to [[film noir]] conventions: the ''[[femme fatale]]''; protagonist-narration (removed in later versions); dark and shadowy cinematography; and the questionable moral outlook of the hero – in this case, extended to include reflections upon the nature of his own humanity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot;&gt;Barlow, Aaron &quot;Reel Toads and Imaginary Cities: Philip K.

Dick&quot; in Brooker, pp. 59–76&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistically, the theme of mortality is subtly reiterated in the chess game between Roy and Tyrell, based on the famous [[Immortal Game]] of 1851,&lt;ref name=&quot;chapman&quot;&gt;{{citation |last1= Chapman |first1 = Murray|year=1992–1995 |url= http://www.faqs.org/faqs/movies/bladerunner-faq/ |title=Blade Runner: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)|publisher=Murray Chapman, University of Queensland|accessdate=July 27, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140404130916/http://www.faqs.org/faqs/movies/bladerunner-faq/|archivedate=2014-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Scott has said that was coincidental.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 384&lt;/ref&gt;

''Blade Runner'' delves into the implications of technology on the environment and on society by reaching to the past, using literature, [[religious symbolism]], classical dramatic themes, and film noir. This tension between past, present, and future is mirrored in the retrofitted future of ''Blade Runner'', which is high-tech and gleaming in places but decayed and old elsewhere. Ridley Scott described the film as: &quot;extremely dark, both literally and metaphorically, with an oddly masochistic feel&quot;, in an interview by [[Lynn Barber]] for ''[[The Observer]]'' (London) in 2002. Scott &quot;liked the idea of exploring pain&quot; in the wake of his brother's skin cancer death: &quot;When he was ill, I used to go and visit him in London, and that was really traumatic for me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;scottobserver&quot; /&gt;

An aura of paranoia suffuses the film: corporate power looms large; the police seem omnipresent; vehicle and warning lights probe into buildings; and the consequences of huge biomedical power over the individual are explored – especially the consequences for replicants of their implanted memories. Control over the environment is depicted as taking place on a vast scale, hand in hand with the absence of any natural life, with artificial animals substituting for their extinct predecessors. This oppressive backdrop explains the frequently referenced migration of humans to extra-terrestrial (&quot;off-world&quot;) colonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1= Leaver |first1 = Tama |year= 1997 |title= Post-Humanism and Ecocide in William Gibson's ''Neuromancer'' and Ridley Scott's ''Blade Runner'' | url=http://project.cyberpunk.ru/idb/post-humanism_and_ecocide.html | publisher=Tama Leaver, University of Western Australia | accessdate=July 27, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130703104841/http://project.cyberpunk.ru:80/idb/post-humanism_and_ecocide.html |archivedate=2013-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The dystopian themes explored in ''Blade Runner'' are an early example of [[cyberpunk]] concepts expanding into film. Eyes are a recurring motif, as are manipulated images, calling into question reality and our ability to accurately perceive and remember it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1= Saini | first1 = Tinku |year= 1996 |url=http://kszu.standord.edu/uwi/br/tinku/ |title=Eye disbelieve |publisher=Tinku Saini, University of Washington |accessdate=January 31, 2008 |archiveurl=http://wolftrappe.blogspot.com/2006/09/eye-disbelieve-by-tinku-saini.html|archivedate = September 15, 2006}} {{Wayback|url=http://wolftrappe.blogspot.com/2006/09/eye-disbelieve-by-tinku-saini.html|date =20120328055807}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=McCoy |first1 = John|url= http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu/~syverson/309-fall95/classpage/bladerunner/mccoy/|title=The Eyes Tell All|publisher=University of Texas at Austin|accessdate=July 27, 2011|year=1995|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130916221220/http://www.cwrl.utexas.edu:80/~syverson/309-fall95/classpage/bladerunner/mccoy/|archivedate=2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bukatman, pp. 9–11&lt;/ref&gt;

These thematic elements provide an atmosphere of uncertainty for ''Blade Runner''{{'}}s central theme of examining humanity. In order to discover replicants, an empathy test is used, with a number of its questions focused on the treatment of animals – seemingly an essential indicator of someone's &quot;humanity&quot;. The replicants appear to show compassion and concern for one another and are juxtaposed against human characters who lack empathy while the mass of humanity on the streets is cold and impersonal. The film goes so far as to put in doubt whether Deckard is human, and forces the audience to re-evaluate what it means to be human.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1 = Kerman | first1 = Judith | year = 1991 | title = Retrofitting ''Blade Runner'': Issues in Ridley Scott's ''Blade Runner'' and Philip K.

The question of whether Deckard is intended to be a human or a replicant has been an ongoing controversy since the film's release.&lt;ref&gt;Bukatman, pp. 80–83&lt;/ref&gt; Both Michael Deeley and Harrison Ford wanted Deckard to be human while Hampton Fancher preferred ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt; Ridley Scott has confirmed that in his vision Deckard is a replicant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1= Peary | first1 = Danny |year= 1984 |title= Omni's Screen Flights/Screen Fantasies: The Future According to Science Fiction |chapter= Directing ''Alien'' and ''Blade Runner'': An Interview with Ridley Scott |publisher=Dolphin |location= Garden City |pages= 293–302 |isbn= 978-0-385-19202-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytkaplan&quot;&gt;{{Citation

Deckard's unicorn dream sequence, inserted into the ''Director's Cut'', coinciding with Gaff's parting gift of an origami unicorn is seen by many as showing that Deckard is a replicant – as Gaff could have accessed Deckard's implanted memories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alessio&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/825641.stm|title=''Blade Runner'' riddle solved|date=July 9, 2000|publisher=BBC |accessdate=July 27, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140406230204/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/825641.stm|archivedate=2014-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interpretation that Deckard is a replicant is challenged by others who believe the unicorn imagery shows that the characters, whether human or replicant, share the same dreams and recognize their affinity,&lt;ref&gt;Brooker, Peter &quot;Imagining the Real: ''Blade Runner'' and Discourses on the Postmetropolis&quot; in Brooker, pp. 9, 222&lt;/ref&gt; or that the absence of a decisive answer is crucial to the film's main theme.&lt;ref&gt;Bukatman, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; The inherent ambiguity and uncertainty of the film, as well as its textual richness, have permitted viewers to see it from their own perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;Hills, Matt &quot;Academic Textual Poachers: ''Blade Runner'' as Cult Canonical Film&quot; in Brooker, pp. 124–141&lt;/ref&gt;

Casting the film proved troublesome, particularly for the lead role of Deckard. Screenwriter Hampton Fancher envisioned [[Robert Mitchum]] as Deckard and wrote the character's dialogue with Mitchum in mind.&lt;ref name=&quot;DangerousDays&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner|type = ''Blade Runner: The Final Cut'' DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros.]]|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director Ridley Scott and the film's producers spent months meeting and discussing the role with [[Dustin Hoffman]], who eventually departed over differences in vision.&lt;ref name=&quot;DangerousDays&quot; /&gt; Harrison Ford was ultimately chosen for several reasons, including his performance in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films, Ford's interest in the ''Blade Runner'' story, and discussions with [[Steven Spielberg]] who was finishing ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' at the time and strongly praised Ford's work in the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;DangerousDays&quot; /&gt; Following his success in films like ''Star Wars'' (1977) and ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' (1981), Ford was looking for a role with dramatic depth.&lt;ref name=&quot;BladeRunnerNightmare&quot;/&gt; According to production documents, several actors were considered for the role, including [[Gene Hackman]], [[Sean Connery]], [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Paul Newman]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Tommy Lee Jones]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Al Pacino]], and [[Burt Reynolds]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DangerousDays&quot; /&gt;

''Blade Runner'' used a number of then-lesser-known actors: [[Sean Young]] portrays Rachael, an experimental replicant implanted with the memories of Tyrell's niece, causing her to believe she is human;&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nina Axelrod]] auditioned for the role.&lt;ref name=&quot;DangerousDays&quot; /&gt; [[Daryl Hannah]] portrays Pris, a &quot;basic pleasure model&quot; replicant; [[Stacey Nelkin]] auditioned for the role, but was given another part in the film, which was ultimately cut before filming.&lt;ref name=&quot;DangerousDays&quot; /&gt; Casting Pris and Rachael was challenging, requiring several screen tests, with [[Morgan Paull]] playing the role of Deckard. Paull was cast as Deckard's fellow bounty hunter Holden based on his performances in the tests.&lt;ref name=&quot;DangerousDays&quot; /&gt; [[Brion James]] portrays Leon Kowalski, a combat replicant, and [[Joanna Cassidy]] portrays Zhora, an assassin replicant. 
[[Edward James Olmos]] portrays Gaff. Olmos used his diverse ethnic background, and personal research, to help create the fictional &quot;[[Cityspeak]]&quot; language his character uses in the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;FutureNoir-p115&quot;&gt;Sammon, pp. 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; His initial address to Deckard at the noodle bar is partly in Hungarian and means, &quot;Horse dick [bullshit]! No way. You are the Blade ... Blade Runner.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FutureNoir-p115&quot; /&gt; [[M. Emmet Walsh]] plays Captain Bryant, a hard-drinking, sleazy, and underhanded police veteran typical of the [[film noir]] genre.

{{Anchor|Writing|Development}}
Interest in adapting [[Philip K. Dick]]'s novel ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' developed shortly after its 1968 publication. Director [[Martin Scorsese]] was interested in filming the novel, but never [[option (finance)|optioned]] it.&lt;ref&gt;Bukatman, p. 13; Sammon, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Herb Jaffe]] optioned it in the early 1970s, but Dick was unimpressed with the screenplay written by Herb's son Robert: &quot;Jaffe's screenplay was so terribly done&amp;nbsp;... Robert flew down to Santa Ana to speak with me about the project. And the first thing I said to him when he got off the plane was, 'Shall I beat you up here at the airport, or shall I beat you up back at my apartment?' &quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dick quoted in Sammon, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

The screenplay by [[Hampton Fancher]]&lt;!--Not titled &quot;Android&quot; initially&amp;nbsp;– See Sammon, pp. 32 and 38 for explanation--&gt; was optioned in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 23–30&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Michael Deeley]] became interested in Fancher's draft and convinced director Ridley Scott to film it. Scott had previously declined the project, but after leaving the slow production of ''[[Dune (film)|Dune]]'', wanted a faster-paced project to take his mind off his older brother's recent death.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 43–49&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the project on February 21, 1980, and managed to push up the promised [[Filmways]] financing from US$13&amp;nbsp;million to $15&amp;nbsp;million. Fancher's script focused more on environmental issues and less on issues of humanity and faith, which had featured heavily in the novel, and Scott wanted changes. Fancher found a cinema treatment by [[William S. Burroughs]] for [[Alan E. Nourse]]'s novel ''[[The Bladerunner]]'' (1974), titled ''[[Blade Runner (a movie)]]''.{{#tag:ref|Some editions of Nourse's novel use the two-word spacing ''Blade Runner'', as does the Burroughs book.|group=nb}} Scott liked the name, so Deeley obtained the rights to the titles. Eventually he hired [[David Peoples]] to rewrite the script and Fancher left the job over the issue on December 21, 1980, although he later returned to contribute additional rewrites.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 49–63&lt;/ref&gt;

Having invested over $2.5&amp;nbsp;million in pre-production,&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; as the date of commencement of principal photography neared, Filmways withdrew financial backing. In ten days Deeley had secured $21.5&amp;nbsp;million in financing through a three-way deal between [[The Ladd Company]] (through Warner Bros.), the Hong Kong-based producer [[Run Run Shaw|Sir Run Run Shaw]], and [[Tandem Productions]].&lt;ref&gt;Bukatman, pp. 18–19; Sammon, pp. 64–67&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip K. Dick became concerned that no one had informed him about the film's production, which added to his distrust of Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt; After Dick criticized an early version of Hampton Fancher's script in an article written for the Los Angeles ''Select TV Guide'', the studio sent Dick the David Peoples rewrite.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 67–69&lt;/ref&gt; Although Dick died shortly before the film's release, he was pleased with the rewritten script, and with a twenty-minute special effects test reel that was screened for him when he was invited to the studio. Despite his well known skepticism of Hollywood in principle, Dick enthused to Ridley Scott that the world created for the film looked exactly as he had imagined it.&lt;ref name=&quot;FutureNoir-p284&quot;&gt;Sammon, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; He said, &quot;I saw a segment of [[Douglas Trumbull]]'s special effects for ''Blade Runner'' on the KNBC-TV news. I recognized it immediately. It was my own interior world. They caught it perfectly.&quot; He also approved of the film's script, saying, &quot;After I finished reading the screenplay, I got the novel out and looked through it. The two reinforce each other, so that someone who started with the novel would enjoy the movie and someone who started with the movie would enjoy the novel.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dick's final interview&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Boonstra|first=John|title=A final interview with science fiction's boldest visionary, who talks candidly about ''Blade Runner'', inner voices and the temptations of Hollywood|journal=Rod Serling's the Twilight Zone Magazine|volume=2|issue=3|date=June 1982|pages=47–52|url=http://www.philipkdick.com/media_twilightzone.html|accessdate=July 27, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130528112644/http://www.philipkdick.com:80/media_twilightzone.html|archivedate=2013-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motion picture was dedicated to Dick.&lt;ref&gt;Blade Runner film, dedication after credits, 1:51:30&lt;/ref&gt; Principal photography of ''Blade Runner'' began on March 9, 1981, and ended four months later.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Ford revealed, &quot;''Blade Runner'' is not one of my favorite films. I tangled with Ridley.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from friction with the director, Ford also disliked the voiceovers: &quot;When we started shooting it had been tacitly agreed that the version of the film that we had agreed upon was the version without voiceover narration. It was a f**king {{sic}}&lt;!--This is a direct quote from source, and is correct as written with two asterisks.--&gt; nightmare. I thought that the film had worked without the narration. But now I was stuck re-creating that narration. And I was obliged to do the voiceovers for people that did not represent the director's interests.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BladeRunnerNightmare&quot;&gt;{{citation

The [[Bradbury Building]] served as a filming location, and a Warner Bros. backlot housed the LA 2019 streets. Test screenings resulted in several changes including adding a voice over, a happy ending, and the removal of a Holden hospital scene. The relationship between the filmmakers and the investors was difficult, which culminated in Deeley and Scott being fired but still working on the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;edge-doc-review&quot;/&gt; Crew members created T-shirts during filming saying, &quot;Yes Guv'nor, My Ass&quot; that mocked Scott's unfavorable comparison of U.S. and British crews; Scott responded with a T-shirt of his own, &quot;Xenophobia Sucks&quot; making the incident known as the T-shirt war.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 218&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pajiba-smith&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pajiba.com/seriously_random_lists/mindhole-blowers-20-facts-about-blade-runner-that-might-leave-you-questioning-ridley-scotts-humanity.php|title=Mindhole Blowers: 20 facts about Blade Runner that might leave you questioning Ridley Scotts humanity|last=Davis|first=Cindy|date=November 8, 2011|publisher=pajiba.com|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paull]] (production designer) and [[David Snyder]] (art director) realized Scott's and Mead's sketches. Douglas Trumbull and Richard Yuricich supervised the special effects for the film.

''Blade Runner'' has numerous deep similarities to [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', including a built-up urban environment, in which the wealthy literally live above the workers, dominated by a huge building – the Stadtkrone Tower in ''Metropolis'' and the Tyrell Building in ''Blade Runner''. Special effects supervisor David Dryer used stills from ''Metropolis'' when lining up ''Blade Runner''{{'}}s miniature building shots.&lt;ref&gt;Bukatman, pp. 61–63; Sammon, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Spinner&quot; is the generic term for the fictional flying cars used in the film. A Spinner can be driven as a ground-based vehicle, and take off vertically, hover, and cruise using [[jet engine|jet propulsion]] much like [[VTOL|Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL)]] aircraft. They are used extensively by the police to patrol and survey the population, and it is clear that despite restrictions wealthy people can acquire spinner licenses.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle was conceived and designed by [[Syd Mead]] who described the spinner as an &quot;aerodyne&quot;—a vehicle which directs air downward to create [[lift (force)|lift]], though press kits for the film stated that the spinner was propelled by three engines: &quot;conventional [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion]], jet, and [[anti-gravity]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SJPSTop40&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=The top 40 cars from feature films: 30.

The Voight-Kampff machine (or device) is a fictional interrogation tool, originating in the book where it is spelled Voigt-Kampff. The Voight-Kampff is a [[polygraph]]-like machine used by Blade Runners to assist in the testing of an individual to determine if they are a replicant. It measures bodily functions such as respiration, blush response, heart rate, and eye movement in response to emotionally provocative questions.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; In the film two replicants take the test, Leon and Rachael, and Deckard tells Tyrell that it usually takes 20 to 30 cross-referenced questions to distinguish a replicant; in contrast with the book, where it is stated it only takes &quot;six or seven&quot; questions to make a determination. In the film it takes more than one hundred questions to determine if Rachael is a replicant.

===Music===
{{Main|Blade Runner (soundtrack)}}

The ''Blade Runner'' soundtrack by [[Vangelis]] is a dark melodic combination of classic composition and futuristic synthesizers which mirrors the film-noir retro-future envisioned by Ridley Scott. Vangelis, fresh from his [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning score for ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;NSVan&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=Blade Runner - Scoring the music|url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/bladerunner/index.htm|publisher=Nemo Studios|accessdate=July 27, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131019015508/http://www.nemostudios.co.uk:80/bladerunner/index.htm|archivedate=2013-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; composed and performed the music on his synthesizers.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 271–274&lt;/ref&gt; He also made use of various chimes and the vocals of collaborator [[Demis Roussos]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FutureNoir-p419&quot;&gt;Sammon, pp. 419–423&lt;/ref&gt; Another memorable sound is the haunting tenor sax solo &quot;Love Theme&quot; by British saxophonist [[Dick Morrissey]], who appeared on many of Vangelis' albums. Ridley Scott also used &quot;Memories of Green&quot; from Vangelis' album ''[[See You Later]]'' (an orchestral version of which Scott would later use in his film ''[[Someone to Watch Over Me (film)|Someone to Watch Over Me]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Larsen | first = Peter | title = Film music | publisher=Reaktion Books | location = London | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-86189-341-3 |page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Vangelis' compositions and ambient textures, the film's sound scape also features a track by the Japanese ensemble Nipponia (&quot;Ogi No Mato&quot; or &quot;The Folding Fan as a Target&quot; from the Nonesuch Records release ''Traditional Vocal and Instrumental Music'') and a track by harpist Gail Laughton (&quot;Harps of the Ancient Temples&quot; from Laurel Records).&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being well received by fans and critically acclaimed and nominated in 1983 for a [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] and [[Golden Globe]] as best original score, and the promise of a soundtrack album from Polydor Records in the end titles of the film, the release of the official soundtrack recording was delayed for over a decade. There are two official releases of the music from ''Blade Runner''. In light of the lack of a release of an album, the [[New American Orchestra]] recorded an orchestral adaptation in 1982 which bore little resemblance to the original. Some of the film tracks would in 1989 surface on the compilation ''Vangelis: Themes'', but not until the 1992 release of the ''Director's Cut'' version would a substantial amount of the film's score see commercial release.&lt;ref name=&quot;FutureNoir-p419&quot; /&gt;

These delays and poor reproductions led to the production of many [[bootleg recording]]s over the years. A bootleg tape surfaced in 1982 at science fiction conventions and became popular given the delay of an official release of the original recordings, and in 1993 &quot;Off World Music, Ltd&quot; created a bootleg CD that would prove more comprehensive than Vangelis' official CD in 1994.&lt;ref name=&quot;FutureNoir-p419&quot; /&gt; A set with three CDs of ''Blade Runner''-related Vangelis music was released in 2007. Titled ''Blade Runner Trilogy'', the first CD contains the same tracks as the 1994 official soundtrack release, the second CD contains previously unreleased music from the movie, and the third CD is all newly composed music from Vangelis, inspired by, and in the spirit of the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11110-blade-runner-trilogy-25th-anniversary/ |title=Album Review: Vangelis: ''Blade Runner Trilogy: 25th Anniversary'' |first=Mike |last=Orme |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] |accessdate=July 27, 2011 |date=February 7, 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131029200702/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11110-blade-runner-trilogy-25th-anniversary/ |archivedate=2013-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
''Blade Runner'' was released in 1,290 theaters on June 25, 1982. That date was chosen by producer [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]] because his previous highest-grossing films (''[[Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope|Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'') had a similar opening date (May 25) in 1977 and 1979, making the date his &quot;lucky day&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt;
The gross for the opening weekend was a disappointing $6.15&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;Bukatman, p. 34; Sammon, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; A significant factor in the film's rather poor box office performance was that it was released around the same time as other science fiction films, including ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'', ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', and, most significantly, ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', which dominated box office revenues that summer.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 316–317&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
Film critics were polarized as some felt the story had taken a back seat to special effects and that it was not the action/adventure the studio had advertised. Others acclaimed its complexity and predicted it would stand the test of time.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 313–315&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, a general criticism was its slow pacing that detracts from other strengths;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Hicks|first1=Chris|date=September 11, 1992|url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700000200/Blade-Runner.html|title=Movie review: Blade Runner |publisher=Deseret News Publishing Co|accessdate=July 27, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140407001657/http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700000200/Blade-Runner.html|archivedate=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheila Benson from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called it &quot;Blade Crawler&quot;, while Pat Berman in ''[[The State (newspaper)|The State]]'' and ''[[Columbia Record]]'' described it as &quot;science fiction pornography&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Sammon, p. 313 and p. 314, respectively&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pauline Kael]] noted that with its &quot;extraordinary&quot; congested-megalopolis sets, ''Blade Runner'' &quot;has its own look, and a visionary sci-fi movie that has its own look can't be ignored – it has its place in film history&quot; but &quot;hasn't been thought out in human terms&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kael&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Kael|first=Pauline|title=Taking It All In|year=1984|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|isbn=978-0-03-069361-8|pages=360–365}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] praised the visuals of both the original ''Blade Runner'' and the ''Director's Cut'' versions and recommended it for that reason; however, he found the human story clichéd and a little thin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebert&quot; /&gt; In 2007, upon release of ''The Final Cut'', Ebert somewhat revised his original opinion of the film and added it to his list of Great Movies, while noting, &quot;I have been assured that my problems in the past with ''Blade Runner'' represent a failure of my own taste and imagination, but if the film was perfect, why has Sir Ridley continued to tinker with it?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20071103%2FREVIEWS08%2F71103001%2F1023|date= November 3, 2007|title= Blade Runner: The Final Cut (1982)|authorlink= Roger Ebert | last1 = Ebert | first1 = Roger |accessdate=July 27, 2011 |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20121021082313/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com:80/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20071103/REVIEWS08/71103001/1023|archivedate= 2012-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Blade Runner'' holds a 91% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] with an average score of 8.4 out of 10 from 96 reviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;RottenTomatoes&quot;/&gt; The site's main consensus reads &quot;Misunderstood when it first hit theaters, the influence of Ridley Scott's mysterious, neo-noir Blade Runner has deepened with time.

===Versions===
{{Main|Versions of Blade Runner}}
Several different versions of ''Blade Runner'' have been shown. The original workprint version (1982, 113&amp;nbsp;minutes) was shown for audience test previews in Denver and Dallas in March 1982. Negative responses to the previews led to the modifications resulting in the U.S. theatrical version.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Kaplan|first1=Fred|title=A Cult Classic Restored, Again |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/movies/30kapl.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=September 30, 2007|accessdate=July 27, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131220052847/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/30/movies/30kapl.html|archivedate=2013-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; The workprint was shown as a director's cut without Scott's approval at the Los Angeles Fairfax Theater in May 1990, at an AMPAS showing in April 1991, and in September and October 1991 at the Los Angeles NuArt Theater and the San Francisco Castro Theater.&lt;ref&gt;Bukatman, pp. 36–37; Sammon, pp. 334–340&lt;/ref&gt; Positive responses pushed the studio to approve work on an official director's cut.&lt;ref&gt;Bukatman, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; A San Diego Sneak Preview was shown only once, in May 1982, and was almost identical to the U.S. theatrical version but contained three extra scenes not shown in any other version, including the 2007 Final Cut.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 306 and 309–311&lt;/ref&gt;

Two versions were shown in the film's 1982 theatrical release: the U.S. theatrical version (116&amp;nbsp;minutes), known as the original version or ''Domestic Cut'', released on [[Betamax]] and VHS in 1983 and [[Laserdisc]] in 1987; and the ''International Cut'' (117&amp;nbsp;minutes), also known as the &quot;Criterion Edition&quot; or &quot;uncut version&quot;, which included more violent action scenes than the U.S. version. Although initially unavailable in the U.S., and distributed in Europe and Asia via theatrical and local Warner Home Video Laserdisc releases, it was later released on VHS and [[Criterion Collection]] Laserdisc in North America, and re-released in 1992 as a &quot;10th Anniversary Edition&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 326–329&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott's ''Director's Cut'' (1991, 116&amp;nbsp;minutes) was made available on VHS and Laserdisc in 1993, and on DVD in 1997. Significant changes from the theatrical version include: the removal of Deckard's voice-over; re-insertion of a unicorn sequence; and removal of the studio-imposed happy ending. Scott provided extensive notes and consultation to Warner Bros. through film preservationist Michael Arick, who was put in charge of creating the ''Director's Cut''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sammon, pp. 353, 365&quot; /&gt; Scott's ''The Final Cut'' (2007, 117&amp;nbsp;minutes) was released by Warner Bros. theatrically on October 5, 2007, and subsequently released on DVD, [[HD DVD]], and [[Blu-ray Disc]] in December 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;thedigitalbits&quot; /&gt; This is the only version over which Scott had complete editorial control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sammon, pp. 353, 365&quot; /&gt;

While not initially a success with North American audiences, the film was popular internationally and garnered a [[cult film|cult following]].&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, pp. 318–329&lt;/ref&gt; The film's dark style and futuristic designs have served as a benchmark and its influence can be seen in many subsequent science fiction films, [[anime]], video games, and television programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barlow&quot; /&gt; For example, [[Ronald D.

Among the folklore that has developed around the film over the years has been the belief that the film was a curse to the companies whose logos were displayed prominently as [[product placement]]s in some scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Sammon, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; While they were market leaders at the time, [[Atari]], [[Bell System|Bell]], [[Cuisinart]] and [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] experienced setbacks after the film's release. [[The Coca-Cola Company]] suffered losses during its failed introduction of [[New Coke]] in 1985, but soon afterwards regained its market share.&lt;ref name=chapman/&gt;

===In other media===
Before the film's [[principal photography]] began, ''[[Cinefantastique]]'' magazine commissioned Paul M. Sammon to write an article about ''Blade Runner''{{'}}s production which became the book ''Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.brmovie.com/Encyclopedia/PQRST.HTML |title= Encyclopedia Blade Runner|accessdate=January 22, 2008 |publisher=BRmovie.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080316193547/http://www.brmovie.com/Encyclopedia/PQRST.HTML |archivedate = March 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The book chronicles ''Blade Runner''{{'}}s evolution, focusing on film-set politics, especially the British director's experiences with his first American film crew; of which producer [[Alan Ladd, Jr.]] has said, &quot;Harrison wouldn't speak to Ridley and Ridley wouldn't speak to Harrison. By the end of the shoot Ford was 'ready to kill Ridley', said one colleague. He really would have taken him on if he hadn't been talked out of it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last= Shone | first= Tom | year= 2004 | title= Blockbuster | isbn = 978-0-7432-3990-5 | publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Future Noir'' has short cast biographies and quotations about their experiences, and photographs of the film's production and preliminary sketches. A second edition of ''Future Noir'' was published in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url = http://scribble.com/uwi/br/fn/ | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20010624131853/scribble.com/uwi/br/fn/ | archivedate = June 24, 2001 | title= Future Noir: Lost Chapters |publisher=2019:Lost Worlds |accessdate=February 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philip K. Dick refused a $400,000 offer to write a ''Blade Runner'' novelization, saying: &quot;[I was] told the cheapo novelization would have to appeal to the twelve-year-old audience&quot; and &quot;[it] would have probably been disastrous to me artistically.&quot; He added, &quot;That insistence on my part of bringing out the original novel and not doing the novelization – they were just furious. They finally recognized that there was a legitimate reason for reissuing the novel, even though it cost them money. It was a victory not just of contractual obligations but of theoretical principles.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dick's final interview&quot; /&gt; ''Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'' was eventually reprinted as a [[movie tie-in (book)|tie-in]], with the film poster as a cover and the original title in parentheses below the ''Blade Runner'' title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://books.google.com/?id=n0pzCsR6yDQC|title=Blade runner: (Do androids dream of electric sheep)|last=Dick|first=Philip K.|year=2007|publisher=Del Rey Books|page=216|accessdate=July 27, 2011|isbn=978-0-345-35047-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]] scripted the comic book adaptation, ''[[Marvel Comics Super Special|A Marvel Super Special: Blade Runner]]'', published in September 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/36674/ ''Marvel Super Special'' #22] at the [[Grand Comics Database]] {{Wayback|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/36674/|date =20140406235318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two video games based on the film, [[Blade Runner (1985 video game)|one from 1985]] for [[Commodore 64]], [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]] and [[Amstrad CPC]] by CRL Group PLC based on the music by Vangelis (due to licensing issues), and [[Blade Runner (1997 video game)|another action adventure PC game from 1997]] by [[Westwood Studios]]. The 1997 video game featured new characters and branching storylines based on the ''Blade Runner'' world. Eldon Tyrell, Gaff, Leon, Rachael, Chew, and J.F. Sebastian appear, and their voice files are recorded by the original actors.&lt;ref name=BRcast/&gt; The player assumes the role of McCoy, another replicant-hunter working at the same time as Deckard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atkins&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tosca&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BRcast&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.brmovie.com/BR_Game_MW01.htm |title=Blade Runner |publisher=BRMovie |accessdate=August 10, 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080714055512/http://www.brmovie.com/BR_Game_MW01.htm |archivedate = July 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PC game featured a non-linear plot, [[non-player character]]s that each ran in their own independent [[Artificial intelligence|AI]], and an unusual pseudo-3D engine (which eschewed polygonal solids in favor of [[Voxel#Computer gaming|voxel]] elements) that did not require the use of a 3D accelerator card to play the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Bates | first=Jason | title=Westwood's Blade Runner|journal=PC Gamer|volume=4|issue=9| publisher=Blade Zone | date=September 9, 1997 | url=http://media.bladezone.com/contents/game/BR-PCGame1.html | accessdate=July 27, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20121127104952/http://media.bladezone.com/contents/game/BR-PCGame1.html|archivedate=2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The television film ''[[Total Recall 2070]]'' was initially planned as a spin-off of the movie ''[[Total Recall (1990 film)|Total Recall]]'', and would eventually be transformed into a hybrid of ''Total Recall'' and ''Blade Runner''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The film has been the subject of several documentaries. ''On the Edge of Blade Runner'' (2000, 55&amp;nbsp;minutes) was directed by Andrew Abbott and hosted/written by [[Mark Kermode]].

==Sequels==
Dick's friend, [[K. W. Jeter]], wrote three authorized ''Blade Runner'' novels that continue Deckard's story, attempting to resolve the differences between the film and ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'':&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Christy &quot;Originals and Copies:The Fans of Philip K. Dick, ''Blade Runner'' and K. W. Jeter&quot; in Brooker, pp. 142–156&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Blade Runner 2: The Edge of Human]]'' (1995), ''[[Blade Runner 3: Replicant Night]]'' (1996), and ''[[Blade Runner 4: Eye and Talon]]'' (2000). By 1999, [[Stuart Hazeldine]] had written a sequel to ''Blade Runner'' based on ''The Edge of Human'', titled ''Blade Runner Down''; the project was shelved due to rights issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;sequels&quot;&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.mybladerunner.com/faq/1-8-are-there-any-sequels-i-heard-rumours/| title=The Blade Runner FAQ: Are there any sequels?

Scott considered developing a sequel, tentatively titled ''Metropolis''.&lt;ref name=sequels/&gt; At the 2007 Comic-Con Scott again announced that he was considering a sequel to the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.thedigitalbits.com/site_archive/mytwocentsa140.html | title=My Two Cents | accessdate=December 17, 2007 | publisher=The Digital Bits, Inc. | last1=Hunt | first1=Bill }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Eagle Eye]]'' co-writer Travis Wright worked with producer Bud Yorkin for several years on the project.

In June 2009 ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Scott and his brother [[Tony Scott]] were working on a ''Blade Runner'' prequel, set in 2019. The prequel, ''Purefold'', was planned as a series of 5–10&amp;nbsp;minute shorts, aimed first at the [[webisode|web]] and then perhaps television. Due to rights issues the proposed series was not to be linked too closely to the characters or events of the 1982 film.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Stone |first=Brad |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/web-series-tied-to-blade-runner-is-in-the-works |title=Web Series Tied to 'Blade Runner' Is In the Works|publisher=New York Times |date= June 4, 2009|accessdate=July 27, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140223044740/http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/04/web-series-tied-to-blade-runner-is-in-the-works/|archivedate=2014-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 7, 2010, it was announced that production on ''Purefold'' had ceased, due to funding problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ag8.com/ |title=Ag8 |accessdate=December 23, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140209225218/http://www.ag8.com/|archivedate=2014-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 4, 2011, [[io9]] reported that Yorkin was developing a new ''Blade Runner'' film.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://io9.com/#!5774950/a-warner-bros+financed-production-company-buying-the-rights-to-do-a-blade-runner-sequel-or-prequel |work=[[io9]] |publisher=Gawker Media |accessdate=July 27, 2011 |date=March 4, 2011 |first=Charlie Jane |last=Anders |title=''Blade Runner'' Sequel (or Prequel) in Development Now|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140512085957/http://io9.com/ |archivedate=2014-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also reported that month that director [[Christopher Nolan]] was the desired choice to make the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Orange, B.

It was announced on August 18, 2011, that Scott was to be at the helm of a new ''Blade Runner'' movie, with filming to begin no earlier than 2013. Indications from producer [[Andrew Kosove]] were that Ford was unlikely to be involved in the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Fleming |first=Mike|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/08/ridley-scott-ready-to-direct-new-version-of-seminal-sci-fi-film-blade-runner/|title=Ridley Scott To Direct New 'Blade Runner' Installment For Alcon Entertainment |publisher=deadline.com |date=August 18, 2011 |accessdate=August 19, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140418103232/http://www.deadline.com/2011/08/ridley-scott-ready-to-direct-new-version-of-seminal-sci-fi-film-blade-runner/|archivedate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-14586762 |title=Ridley Scott to direct new Blade Runner film|publisher=BBC|date=August 19, 2011|accessdate=August 19, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140420033805/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-14586762|archivedate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott later said that the film was &quot;liable to be a sequel&quot; but without the previous cast, and that he was close to finding a writer that &quot;might be able to help [him] deliver&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/11/04/ridley-scott-says-he%E2%80%99ll-direct-%E2%80%98blade-runner%E2%80%99-sequel/|author=Chai, Barbara|title=Ridley Scott Says He'll Direct 'Blade Runner' Sequel|publisher=Speakeasy|date=November 4, 2011|accessdate=November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 6, 2012, Kosove denied that any casting considerations had been made in response to buzz that Ford might reprise his role, saying, &quot;It is absolutely, patently false that there has been any discussion about Harrison Ford being in ''Blade Runner''. To be clear, what we are trying to do with Ridley now is go through the painstaking process of trying to break the back of the story&amp;nbsp;... The casting of the movie could not be further from our minds at this moment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Vejvoda, Jim|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2012/02/07/harrison-ford-in-blade-runner-2 |title=Harrison Ford in Blade Runner 2?|publisher=ign.com|date=February 6, 2012|accessdate=February 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Scott was asked about the possibility of a sequel in October 2012, he said, &quot;It's not a rumor—it's happening. With Harrison Ford? I don't know yet. Is he too old? Well, he was a Nexus-6 so we don't know how long he can live. And that's all I'm going to say at this stage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Sullivan|first=Kevin P.|title=Ridley Scott Gives 'Prometheus 2' And 'Blade Runner 2' Updates|url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2012/10/12/prometheus-2-blade-runner-2-updates/|work=MTV Movies Blog|accessdate=October 13, 2012|date=October 12, 2012|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6JF334klm|archivedate=2013-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott informed the ''Variety'' publication in November 2014 that he was no longer the director for the film and would only fulfill a producer's role. Scott also revealed that filming would begin sometime in late 2014/2015, and that Ford's character will only appear in &quot;the third act&quot; of the sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Jacob Kastrenakes|title=Ridley Scott won't direct 'Blade Runner' sequel|url=http://www.theverge.com/2014/11/25/7286991/blade-runner-2-wont-be-directed-by-ridley-scott|website=The Verge|publisher=Vox Media, Inc|accessdate=26 November 2014|date=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
