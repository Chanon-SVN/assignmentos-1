'''Boron''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''B''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;5. Because boron is produced entirely by [[cosmic ray spallation]] and not by [[stellar nucleosynthesis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/listing.php?id=17594|title = Q &amp; A: Where does the element Boron come from?| work=physics.illinois.edu|accessdate = 2011-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is a low-abundance element in both the [[Solar system]] and the [[Crust (geology)|Earth's crust]]. Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the [[borate mineral]]s. These are mined industrially as [[evaporite]]s, such as [[borax]] and [[kernite]]. The largest proven boron deposits are in [[Turkey]], which is also the largest producer of boron minerals.

Chemically uncombined boron, which is classed as a [[metalloid]], is found in small amounts in [[meteoroid]]s, but is not found naturally on Earth. Industrially, very pure boron is produced with difficulty, as boron tends to form refractory materials containing small amounts of carbon or other elements. Several [[allotropes of boron]] exist: [[amorphous]] boron is a brown powder, and crystalline boron is black, extremely hard (about 9.5 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]]), and a poor [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] at room temperature. The primary use of elemental boron is to make [[boron filament]]s, which are used in a similar way to carbon fibers in some high-strength materials.

Almost all boron use is as chemical compounds. About half of global consumption of boron compounds is as additives for [[glass fiber]]s in boron-containing [[fiberglass]] used for insulation or as structural materials. The next leading use is to make boron [[polymers]] and [[ceramic]]s, that play specialized roles as high-strength lightweight structural and refractory materials. [[Borosilicate glass]] glassware is used for its greater strength and breakage resistance (thermal shock resistance) than ordinary soda lime glass. Boron compounds are also used as [[fertilizer]]s in [[agriculture]], and in [[sodium perborate]] [[bleach]]es. In minor uses, boron is an important dopant for semiconductors, and boron-containing [[reagents]] are used as intermediates in the [[organic synthesis|synthesis of organic fine chemicals]]. A few boron-containing organic pharmaceuticals are used, or are in study. Natural boron is composed of two stable isotopes, one of which ([[boron-10]]) has a number of uses as a neutron-capturing agent.

In [[biology]], [[borate]]s have low [[toxicity]] in [[mammal]]s (similar to [[table salt]]), but are more toxic to [[arthropod]]s and are used as [[insecticides]]. [[Boric acid]] is mildly antimicrobial, and a natural boron-containing organic antibiotic is known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/antibiotics1968/48/1/48_1_26/_article|title = The tartrolons, new boron-containing antibiotics from a myxobacterium, Sorangium cellulosum.|accessdate = 2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boron is essential to life. Small amounts of boron compounds play a strengthening role in the [[cell wall]]s of all [[plant]]s, making boron necessary in soils. Experiments indicate a role for boron as an [[ultratrace element]] in animals, but its role in [[Physiology|animal physiology]] is unknown.

==History==
The word ''boron'' was coined from ''[[borax]]'', the mineral from which it was isolated, by analogy with ''carbon'', which it resembles chemically.  For the etymology of ''borax'', see that article. 
[[File:Sassolite.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[Sassolite]].]]

Borax glazes were used in [[China]] from AD 300, and some tincal (crude borax) reached the West, where the Persian alchemist [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] seems to mention it in AD 700. [[Marco Polo]] brought some glazes back to Italy in the 13th century. Agricola, around 1600, reports the use of borax as a flux in [[metallurgy]]. In 1777, [[boric acid]] was recognized in the hot springs ([[soffioni]]) near [[Florence]], Italy, and became known as ''sal sedativum'', with mainly medical uses. The rare mineral is called [[sassolite]], which is found at Sasso, [[Italy]]. Sasso was the main source of [[Europe]]an borax from 1827 to 1872, at which date [[United States|American]] sources replaced it.&lt;ref name=borates&gt;{{Cite book|pages=102; 385–386|title=Borates: handbook of deposits, processing, properties, and use| author = Garrett, Donald E.| publisher =Academic Press| year= 1998| isbn=0-12-276060-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=boron&gt;{{cite web| accessdate= 2009-05-05| url = http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/phys/boron.htm| title = Boron|work=University of Denver|author=Calvert, J. B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boron compounds were relatively rarely used chemicals until the late 1800s when [[Francis Marion Smith]]'s [[Pacific Coast Borax Company]] first popularized these compounds and made them in volume and hence cheap.&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand, G. H. (1982) &quot;Borax Pioneer: Francis Marion Smith.&quot; San Diego: Howell-North Books. p. 267 ISBN 0-8310-7148-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Boron was not recognized as an element until it was isolated by Sir [[Humphry Davy]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Davy&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author = Davy H|year = 1809|title = An account of some new analytical researches on the nature of certain bodies, particularly the alkalies, phosphorus, sulphur, carbonaceous matter, and the acids hitherto undecomposed: with some general observations on chemical theory|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=gpwEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA140#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|volume = 99|pages = 33–104|doi = 10.1098/rstl.1809.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac]] and [[Louis Jacques Thénard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lussac&quot;&gt;Gay Lussac, J.L. and Thenard, L.J.

In his subsequent experiments he used potassium to reduce boric acid instead of [[electrolysis]]. He produced enough boron to confirm a new element and named the element ''boracium''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davy&quot; /&gt; Gay-Lussac and Thénard used iron to reduce boric acid at high temperatures. They showed by oxidizing boron with air that boric acid is an oxidation product of boron.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lussac&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;weeks&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last = Weeks|first = Mary Elvira|authorlink=Mary Elvira Weeks|year = 1933|title = The Discovery of the Elements|publisher = Journal of Chemical Education|location = Easton, PA|chapter = XII.

[[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] identified boron as an element in 1824.&lt;ref&gt;Berzelius produced boron by reducing a borofluoride salt; specifically, by heating potassium borofluoride with potassium metal.

==Preparation of elemental boron in the laboratory==
The earliest routes to elemental boron involved reduction of [[boric oxide]] with metals such as [[magnesium]] or [[aluminium]]. However the product is almost always contaminated with metal [[boride]]s. Pure boron can be prepared by reducing volatile boron halides with [[hydrogen]] at high temperatures. Ultrapure boron for use in the semiconductor industry is produced by the decomposition of [[diborane]] at high temperatures and then further purified with the [[zone melting]] or [[Czochralski process]]es.&lt;ref name=berger&gt;{{Cite book| title = Semiconductor materials| author = Berger, L. I.|publisher = CRC Press| year = 1996| isbn = 0-8493-8912-7| pages = 37–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of boron compounds does not involve formation of elemental boron, but exploits the convenient availability of borates.

Boron is similar to [[carbon]] in its capability to form stable [[covalent bond|covalently bonded]] molecular networks.

===Chemistry of the element===
{{Category see also|Boron compounds}}
Elemental boron is rare and poorly studied because the material is extremely difficult to prepare. Most studies on &quot;boron&quot; involve samples that contain small amounts of carbon. Chemically, boron behaves more similarly to [[silicon]] than to [[aluminium]]. Crystalline boron is chemically inert and resistant to attack by boiling [[hydrofluoric acid|hydrofluoric]] or [[hydrochloric acid]]. When finely divided, it is attacked slowly by hot concentrated [[hydrogen peroxide]], hot concentrated [[nitric acid]], hot [[sulfuric acid]] or hot mixture of sulfuric and [[chromic acid]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laubengayer&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Boron.

L.|issue = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of oxidation of boron depends upon the crystallinity, particle size, purity and temperature. Boron does not react with air at room temperature, but at higher temperatures it burns to form [[boron trioxide]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;HollemanAF&quot;&gt;{{cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|year = 1985|edition = 91–100|pages = 814–864|isbn = 3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first = Arnold F.|last = Holleman|last2=Wiberg|first2=Egon|last3=Wiberg|first3=Nils|chapter = Bor| language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:4 B + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
[[File:Tetraborate-xtal-3D-balls.png|thumb|left|Ball-and-stick model of tetraborate anion, [B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, as it occurs in crystalline borax, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]·8H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Boron atoms are pink, with bridging oxygens in red, and four hydroxyl hydrogens in white. Note two borons are trigonally bonded sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with no formal charge, while the other two borons are tetrahedrally bonded sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, each carrying a formal charge of −1. The oxidation state of all borons is III. This mixture of boron coordination numbers and formal charges is characteristic of natural boron minerals.]]

Boron undergoes halogenation to give trihalides, for example,
:2 B + 3 Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 BBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
The trichloride in practice is usually made from the oxide.&lt;ref name=&quot;HollemanAF&quot;/&gt;

====Chemical compounds====
[[File:Boron-trifluoride-pi-bonding-2D.png|100px|thumb|[[Boron trifluoride|Boron (III) trifluoride]] structure, showing &quot;empty&quot; boron p orbital in pi-type [[coordinate covalent bond]]s]]
In its most familiar compounds, boron has the formal oxidation state III. These include oxides, sulfides, nitrides, and halides.&lt;ref name=&quot;HollemanAF&quot;/&gt;

The trihalides adopt a planar trigonal structure. These compounds are [[Lewis acid]]s in that they readily form [[adduct]]s with electron-pair donors, which are called [[Lewis base]]s. For example, fluoride (F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[boron trifluoride]] (BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) combined to give the [[tetrafluoroborate]] anion, BF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. Boron trifluoride is used in the petrochemical industry as a catalyst. The halides react with water to form [[boric acid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HollemanAF&quot;/&gt;

Boron is found in nature on Earth entirely as various oxides of B(III), often associated with other elements. More than one hundred [[borate mineral]]s contain boron in oxidation state +3. These minerals resemble silicates in some respect, although boron is often found not only in a tetrahedral coordination with oxygen, but also in a trigonal planar configuration. Unlike silicates, the boron minerals never contain boron with coordination number greater than four. A typical motif is exemplified by the tetraborate anions of the common mineral [[borax]], shown at left. The formal negative charge of the tetrahedral borate centers is balanced by metal cations in the minerals, such as the sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) in borax.&lt;ref name=&quot;HollemanAF&quot;/&gt;

{{Main|Boranes}}

Boranes are chemical compounds of boron and hydrogen, with the generic formula of B&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;. These compounds do not occur in nature. Many of the boranes readily oxidise on contact with air, some violently. The parent member BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is called borane, but it is known only in the gaseous state, and dimerises to form diborane, B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. The larger boranes all consist of boron clusters that are polyhedral, some of which exist as isomers. For example, isomers of B&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt; are based on the fusion of two 10-atom clusters.

The most important boranes are diborane B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and two of its pyrolysis products, pentaborane B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; and decaborane B&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;. A large number of anionic boron hydrides are known, e.g. [B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;.

The formal [[oxidation number]] in boranes is positive, and is based on the assumption that hydrogen is counted as −1 as in active metal hydrides. The mean oxidation number for the borons is then simply the ratio of hydrogen to boron in the molecule. For example, in diborane B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, the boron oxidation state is +3, but in decaborane B&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;, it is &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; or +1.4. In these compounds the oxidation state of boron is often not a whole number.

{{Main|Boron nitride}}

The [[boron nitride]]s are notable for the variety of structures that they adopt. They adopt structures analogous to various [[allotropes of carbon]], including graphite, diamond, and nanotubes. In the diamond-like structure called cubic boron nitride (tradename [[Borazon]]), boron atoms exist in the tetrahedral structure of carbons atoms in diamond, but one in every four B-N bonds can be viewed as a [[coordinate covalent bond]], wherein two electrons are donated by the nitrogen atom which acts as the [[Lewis base]] to a bond to the [[Lewis acid]]ic boron(III) centre. Cubic boron nitride, among other applications, is used as an abrasive, as it has a hardness comparable with diamond (the two substances are able to produce scratches on each other). In the BN compound analogue of graphite, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), the positively-charged boron and negatively-charged nitrogen atoms in each plane lie adjacent to the oppositely charged atom in the next plane. Consequently graphite and h-BN have very different properties, although both are lubricants, as these planes slip past each other easily. However, h-BN is a relatively poor electrical and thermal conductor in the planar directions.&lt;ref name=dkg&gt;{{cite journal| title = Hexagonal Boron Nitride (hBN) – Applications from Metallurgy to Cosmetics| url = http://www.esk.com/uploads/tx_userjspresseveroeff/PR_0712_CFI_12-2007_Hexagonales-BN_e_01.pdf| author =Engler, M. | journal = Cfi/Ber.

=====Organoboron chemistry=====
{{Main|Organoboron chemistry}}
A large number of organoboron compounds are known and many are useful in [[organic synthesis]]. Many are produced from [[hydroboration–oxidation reaction|hydroboration]], which employs [[diborane]],  B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, a simple [[borane]] chemical. Organoboron(III) compounds are usually tetrahedral or trigonal planar, for example, [[tetraphenylborate]], [B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; vs [[triphenylborane]], B(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. However, multiple boron atoms reacting with each other have a tendency to form novel dodecahedral (12-sided) and icosahedral (20-sided) structures composed completely of boron atoms, or with varying numbers of carbon heteroatoms.

Organoboron chemicals have been employed in uses as diverse as [[boron carbide]] (see below), a complex very hard ceramic composed of boron-carbon cluster anions and cations, to [[carborane]]s, carbon-boron [[cluster chemistry]] compounds that can be halogenated to form reactive structures including [[carborane acid]], a [[superacid]]. As one example, carboranes form useful molecular moieties that add considerable amounts of boron to other biochemicals in order to synthesize boron-containing compounds for [[boron neutron capture therapy]] of cancer.

=====Compounds of B(I) and B(II)=====
Although these are not found on Earth naturally, boron forms a variety of stable compounds with formal oxidation state less than three. As for many covalent compounds, formal oxidation states are often of little meaning in [[borane|boron hydrides]] and metal borides. The halides also form derivatives of B(I) and B(II). BF, isoelectronic with N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is not isolable in condensed form, but [[diboron tetrafluoride|B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] and B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are well characterized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Magnesium-diboride-3D-balls.png|thumb|Ball-and-stick model of superconductor magnesium diboride. Boron atoms lie in hexagonal aromatic graphite-like layers, with a charge of −1 on each boron atom. Magnesium(II) ions lie between layers]]
Binary metal-boron compounds, the metal borides, contain boron in oxidation state less than III. Illustrative is [[magnesium diboride]] (MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Each boron atom has a formal −1 charge and magnesium is assigned a formal charge of 2+.
In this material, the boron centers are trigonal planar, with an extra double bond for each boron, with the boron atoms forming sheets akin to the carbon in [[graphite]]. However, unlike the case with hexagonal boron nitride which by comparison lacks electrons in the plane of the covalent atoms, the delocalized electrons in the plane of magnesium diboride allow it to conduct electricity similar to isoelectronic graphite. In addition, in 2001 this material was found to be a high-temperature [[superconductor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = The Preparation and Structure of Magnesium Boride, MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|author = Jones, Morton E. and Marsh, Richard E. |journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume = 76 |issue = 5| page = 1434| year = 1954|doi = 10.1021/ja01634a089}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1063/1.1570770|url = http://cmp.physics.iastate.edu/canfield/pub/pt0303.pdf|title = Magnesium Diboride: Better Late than Never|year = 2003|last1 = Canfield|first1 = Paul C.|last2 = Crabtree|first2 = George W.|journal = Physics Today|volume = 56|issue = 3|page = 34|bibcode=2003PhT....56c..34C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain other metal borides find specialized applications as hard materials for cutting tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=PvU-qbQJq7IC&amp;pg=PA638|chapter = Titanium Diboride|pages = 638–639|title = Materials handbook: A concise desktop reference|isbn = 978-1-84628-668-1|author = Cardarelli, François|year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the structural perspective, the most distinctive chemical compounds of boron are the hydrides. Included in this series are the cluster compounds [[dodecaborate]] (B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;), [[decaborane]] (B&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;), and the [[carborane]]s such as C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. Characteristically such compounds contain boron with coordination numbers greater than four.&lt;ref name=&quot;HollemanAF&quot;/&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of boron}}
Boron has two naturally occurring and stable [[isotope]]s, &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B (80.1%) and &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B (19.9%). The mass difference results in a wide range of δ&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B values, which are defined as a fractional difference between the &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B and &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B and traditionally expressed in parts per thousand, in natural waters ranging from −16 to +59. There are 13 known isotopes of boron, the shortest-lived isotope is &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;B which decays through [[proton emission]] and [[alpha decay]]. It has a [[half-life]] of 3.5×10&lt;sup&gt;−22&lt;/sup&gt; [[second|s]]. Isotopic fractionation of boron is controlled by the exchange reactions of the boron species B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and [[tetrahydroxyborate|[B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]]. Boron isotopes are also fractionated during mineral crystallization, during H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O phase changes in [[hydrothermal]] systems, and during hydrothermal alteration of [[rock (geology)|rock]]. The latter effect results in preferential removal of the [&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; [[ion]] onto clays. It results in solutions enriched in &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and therefore may be responsible for the large &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B enrichment in seawater relative to both [[ocean]]ic crust and [[continent]]al crust; this difference may act as an [[isotopic signature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first = S.|last = Barth| title = Boron isotopic analysis of natural fresh and saline waters by negative thermal ionization mass spectrometry| journal = Chemical Geology| volume = 143|year = 1997|pages = 255–261|doi = 10.1016/S0009-2541(97)00107-1| issue = 3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exotic &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;B exhibits a [[nuclear halo]], i.e. its radius is appreciably larger than that predicted by the [[semi-empirical mass formula|liquid drop model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Two-body and three-body halo nuclei| first = Z.|last = Liu|journal = Science China Physics, Mechanics &amp; Astronomy| volume = 46| year= 2003| page = 441|doi = 10.1360/03yw0027| issue = 4|bibcode = 2003ScChG..46..441L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B isotope is good at capturing [[thermal neutron]]s (see [[neutron cross section#Typical cross sections]]). Natural boron is about 20% &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B and 80% &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B. The [[nuclear power|nuclear industry]] enriches natural boron to nearly pure &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B. The less-valuable by-product, depleted boron, is nearly pure &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B.

====Commercial isotope enrichment====
Because of its high neutron cross-section, boron-10 is often used to control fission in nuclear reactors as a neutron-capturing substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://web.archive.org/web/20110719031833/http://bibliothek.fzk.de/zb/berichte/FZKA6746.pdf|title = Results of the B4C Control Rod Test QUENCH-07|work=Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe in der Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft|year= 2004|author=Steinbrück, Martin }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several industrial-scale enrichment processes have been developed, however only the fractionated vacuum distillation of the [[dimethyl ether]] adduct of [[boron trifluoride]] (DME-BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and column chromatography of borates are being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://library.igcar.gov.in/html/Contents/IGCNewsletter/nl48/A2.htm|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20081208114410/http://library.igcar.gov.in/html/Contents/IGCNewsletter/nl48/A2.htm|archivedate = 8 December 2008|title = Commissioning of Boron Enrichment Plant|publisher = Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research|accessdate = 2008-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1080/01496398608056140|title = Chromatographic Enrichment of 10B by Using Weak-Base Anion-Exchange Resin|year = 1986|last1 = Aida|first1 = Masao|last2 = Fujii|first2 = Yasuhiko|last3 = Okamoto|first3 = Makoto|journal = Separation Science and Technology|volume = 21|issue = 6|pages = 643–654}} showing an enrichment from 18% to above 94%.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Enriched boron (boron-10)====
[[File:Neutroncrosssectionboron.png|right|320px|thumb|Neutron cross section of boron (top curve is for &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B and bottom curve for &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B)]]

Enriched boron or &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B is used in both radiation shielding and is the primary nuclide used in [[neutron capture therapy of cancer]]. In the latter (&quot;boron neutron capture therapy&quot; or BNCT), a compound containing &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B is incorporated into a pharmaceutical which is selectively taken up by a malignant tumor and tissues near it. The patient is then treated with a beam of low energy neutrons at a relatively low neutron radiation dose. The neutrons, however, trigger energetic and short-range secondary [[alpha particle]] and lithium-7 heavy ion radiation that are products of the boron + neutron [[nuclear reaction]], and this ion radiation additionally bombards the tumor, especially from inside the tumor cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title =A Critical Assessment of Boron Neutron Capture Therapy: An Overview|journal = Journal of Neuro-Oncology|volume = 62|issue = 1|year = 2003|doi = 10.1023/A:1023262817500|pages = 1–5|first = Rolf F.|last = Barth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Radiation Research|pages = 1–18|volume =151| issue =1|year = 1999|title =The Radiation Biology of Boron Neutron Capture Therapy|first = Jeffrey A.|last = Coderre|doi = 10.2307/3579742|pmid = 9973079|last2 = Morris|first2 = GM|jstor = 3579742}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Boron Neutron Capture Therapy of Cancer|first =Rolf F.|last =Barth|journal = Cancer Research|volume = 50|pages = 1061–1070|year=1990|pmid = 2404588|issue = 4|author2 = S|author3 = F}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmainfo.net/reviews/boron-neutron-capture-therapy-overview |title=Boron Neutron Capture Therapy – An Overview |publisher=Pharmainfo.net |date=22 August 2006 |accessdate=2011-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In nuclear reactors, &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B is used for reactivity control and in [[scram|emergency shutdown systems]]. It can serve either function in the form of [[borosilicate]] [[control rods]] or as [[boric acid]]. In [[pressurized water reactor]]s, boric acid is added to the reactor coolant when the plant is shut down for refueling. It is then slowly filtered out over many months as [[fissile]] material is used up and the fuel becomes less reactive.&lt;ref name=reactor&gt;{{Cite book|last = Duderstadt|first = James J.|last2= Hamilton|first2=Louis J.| title = Nuclear Reactor Analysis|publisher = Wiley-Interscience|year = 1976|isbn = 0-471-22363-8|page= 245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B has a theoretical role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN [[inorganic nanotube|nanotube]] material) which would also serve a special role in the radiation shield. One of the difficulties in dealing with [[cosmic rays]], which are mostly high energy protons, is that some secondary radiation from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy [[spallation]] neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as [[polyethylene]], but the moderated neutrons continue to be a radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Li and &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Yu, J. | title = Isotopically Enriched 10BN Nanotubes| journal=Advanced Materials| volume =18|year =2006| url =http://www.rsphysse.anu.edu.au/nanotube/pdf/B10Nnanotubes.pdf | archiveurl =http://web.archive.org/web/20080803192520/http://www.rsphysse.anu.edu.au/nanotube/pdf/B10Nnanotubes.pdf | archivedate =3 August 2008 |doi =10.1002/adma.200600231|page= 2157|last2= Chen|first2= Y.|last3= Elliman|first3= R. G.|last4= Petravic|first4= M.|issue= 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Depleted boron (boron-11)====

===== Radiation-hardened semiconductors =====
[[Cosmic radiation]] will produce secondary neutrons if it hits spacecraft structures. Those neutrons will be captured in &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B, if it is present in the spacecraft's [[semiconductor]]s, producing a [[gamma ray]], an [[alpha particle]], and a [[lithium]] ion. These resultant decay products may then irradiate nearby semiconductor &quot;chip&quot; structures, causing data loss (bit flipping, or [[single event upset]]). In [[radiation-hardened]] semiconductor designs, one countermeasure is to use ''depleted boron'', which is greatly enriched in &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B and contains almost no &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B. It is useful because &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B is largely immune to radiation damage. Depleted boron is a byproduct of the [[nuclear power|nuclear industry]].&lt;ref name=reactor/&gt;

===== Proton-boron fusion =====
{{main | Proton-boron fusion }}
&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B is also a candidate as a fuel for [[aneutronic fusion]]. When struck by a proton with energy of about 500&amp;nbsp;k[[electronvolt|eV]], it produces three alpha particles and 8.7&amp;nbsp;MeV of energy. Most other fusion reactions involving hydrogen and helium produce penetrating neutron radiation, which weakens reactor structures and induces long-term radioactivity, thereby endangering operating personnel. However, the [[alpha particles]] from &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B fusion can be turned directly into electric power, and all radiation stops as soon as the reactor is turned off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first = W.

====NMR spectroscopy====
Both &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B and &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B possess [[nuclear spin]]. The nuclear spin of &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B is 3 and that of &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B is {{frac|3|2}}. These isotopes are, therefore, of use in [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] spectroscopy; and spectrometers specially adapted to detecting the boron-11 nuclei are available commercially. The &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B and &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B nuclei also cause splitting in the [[resonances]] of attached nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Boron NMR| url = http://rmn.iqfr.csic.es/guide/eNMR/chem/B.html| accessdate= 2009-05-05|publisher = BRUKER Biospin| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090502140944/http://rmn.iqfr.csic.es/guide/eNMR/chem/B.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;| archivedate = 2 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Borax crystals.jpg|thumb|right|Borax crystals]]
Boron is rare in the Universe and solar system due to trace formation in the [[Big Bang]] and in stars. It is formed in minor amounts in [[cosmic ray spallation]] [[nucleosynthesis]] and may be found uncombined in [[cosmic dust]] and [[meteoroid]] materials. In the high oxygen environment of Earth, boron is always found fully oxidized to borate. Boron does not appear on Earth in elemental form.

Although boron is a relatively rare element in the Earth's crust, representing only 0.001% of the crust mass, it can be highly concentrated by the action of water, in which many borates are soluble. 
It is found naturally combined in compounds such as [[borax]] and [[boric acid]] (sometimes found in [[volcano|volcanic]] spring waters). About a hundred [[borate minerals]] are known.

==Production==
Economically important sources of boron are the minerals [[colemanite]], rasorite ([[kernite]]), [[ulexite]] and [[tincal]]. Together these constitute 90% of mined boron-containing ore. The largest global borax deposits known, many still untapped, are in Central and Western [[Turkey]], including the provinces of [[Eskişehir]], [[Kütahya]] and [[Balıkesir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Kistler|first = R.

[[Turkey]] and the United States are the largest producers of boron products. Turkey produces about half of the global yearly demand, though [[Eti Mine Works]] ({{lang-tr|Eti Maden İşletmeleri}}) a [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[state-owned company|state-owned]] [[mining industry|mining]] and [[chemical industry|chemicals]] company focusing on boron products.

Almost a quarter (23%) of global boron production comes from the single [[Rio Tinto Borax Mine]] (also known as the U.S. Borax Boron Mine) {{coord|35|2|34.447|N|117|40|45.412|W|type:landmark_globe:earth_region:US-CA|name=Rio Tinto Borax Mine|display=inline}} near [[Boron, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ludb.clui.org/ex/i/CA4982/ |title=U.S. Borax Boron Mine |work=The Center for Land Use Interpretation, Ludb.clui.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riotinto.com/ourproducts/218_our_companies_4438.asp |title=Boras |publisher=Rio Tinto |date=10 April 2012 |accessdate=2013-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market trend===
The average cost of crystalline boron is $5/g.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.rareearth.org/boron_properties.htm |publisher = Los Alamos National Laboratory|title = Boron Properties|accessdate = 2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free boron is chiefly used in making boron fibers, where it is deposited by [[chemical vapor deposition]] on a [[tungsten]] core (see below). Boron fibers are used in lightweight composite applications, such as high strength tapes. This use is a very small fraction of total boron use. Boron is introduced into semiconductors as boron compounds, by ion implantation.

Estimated global consumption of boron (almost entirely as boron compounds) was about 4&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in 2012. Boron mining and refining capacities are considered to be adequate to meet expected levels of growth through the next decade.

The form in which boron is consumed has changed in recent years. The use of ores like [[colemanite]] has declined following concerns over [[arsenic]] content. Consumers have moved toward the use of refined borates and boric acid that have a lower pollutant content.

Increasing demand for boric acid has led a number of producers to invest in additional capacity. Turkey's state-owned [[Eti Mine Works]] opened a new boric acid plant with the production capacity of 100,000 tonnes per year at [[Emet]] in 2003. [[Rio Tinto Group]] increased the capacity of its boron plant from 260,000 tonnes per year in 2003 to 310,000 tonnes per year by May 2005, with plans to grow this to 366,000 tonnes per year in 2006. Chinese boron producers have been unable to meet rapidly growing demand for high quality borates. This has led to imports of sodium tetraborate ([[borax]]) growing by a hundredfold between 2000 and 2005 and boric acid imports increasing by 28% per year over the same period.&lt;ref name=roskill&gt;{{Cite book| title = The Economics of Boron, 11th edition| year = 2006| isbn = 0-86214-516-3| publisher = Roskill Information Services, Ltd.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ceramicindustry.com/Articles/Cover_Story/4b0b7a6ed1cb8010VgnVCM100000f932a8c0____| accessdate = 2009-05-05| title = Raw and Manufactured Materials 2006 Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise in global demand has been driven by high growth rates in [[glass fiber]], [[fiberglass]] and [[borosilicate]] glassware production. A rapid increase in the manufacture of reinforcement-grade boron-containing fiberglass in Asia, has offset the development of boron-free reinforcement-grade fiberglass in Europe and the USA. The recent rises in energy prices may lead to greater use of insulation-grade fiberglass, with consequent growth in the boron consumption. Roskill Consulting Group forecasts that world demand for boron will grow by 3.4% per year to reach 21 million tonnes by 2010. The highest growth in demand is expected to be in Asia where demand could rise by an average 5.7% per year.&lt;ref name=roskill/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.roskill.com/reports/boron| title = Roskill reports: boron|publisher = Roskill|accessdate = 2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Nearly all boron ore extracted from the Earth is destined for refinement into [[boric acid]] and [[sodium tetraborate|sodium tetraborate pentahydrate]]. In the United States, 70% of the boron is used for the production of glass and ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/boron/| title = Boron: Statistics and Information| accessdate= 2009-05-05| publisher = USGS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;{{Cite book| author = Hammond, C.

The major global industrial-scale use of boron compounds (about 46% of end-use) is in production of [[glass fiber]] for boron-containing insulating and structural [[fiberglass]]es, especially in Asia. Boron is added to the glass as borax pentahydrate or boron oxide, to influence the strength or fluxing qualities of the glass fibers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etimineusa.com/en/applications-fiberglass-and-specialty-glass] Discussion of various types of boron addition to glass fibers in fiberglass. Accessed August 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Another 10% of global boron production is for [[borosilicate glass]] as used in high strength glassware. About 15% of global boron is used in boron ceramics, including super-hard materials discussed below. Agriculture consumes 11% of global boron production, and bleaches and detergents about 6%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webstreetangels.com/MiningPresentations/0-940-Orhan-YILMAZ.pdf Global end use of boron in 2011] Accessed August 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Boron fibers and sub-millimeter sized crystalline boron springs are produced by [[laser]]-assisted [[chemical vapor deposition]]. Translation of the focused laser beam allows to produce even complex helical structures. Such structures show good mechanical properties ([[elastic modulus]] 450&amp;nbsp;GPa, fracture strain 3.7%, fracture stress 17&amp;nbsp;GPa) and can be applied as reinforcement of ceramics or in [[microelectromechanical systems|micromechanical systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Microfabrication of three-dimensional boron structures by laser chemical processing| journal = Journal Applied Physics|volume = 72| pages = 5956–5963|year =1992| doi = 10.1063/1.351904|first = S.|last = Johansson| last2 = Schweitz| first2 = Jan-Åke| last3 = Westberg| first3 = Helena| last4 = Boman| first4 = Mats| issue = 12|bibcode = 1992JAP....72.5956J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Boronated fiberglass ===
{{Main|Fiberglass}}
Fiberglass is a [[fiber reinforced plastic|fiber reinforced polymer]] made of [[plastic]] reinforced by [[glass fiber]]s, commonly woven into a mat. The glass fibers used in the material are made of various types of glass depending upon the fiberglass use. These glasses all contain silica or silicate, with varying amounts of oxides of calcium, magnesium, and sometimes boron. The boron is present as borosilicate, borax, or boron oxide, and is added to increase the strength of the glass, or as a fluxing agent to decrease the melting temperature of [[silica]], which is too high to be easily worked in its pure form to make glass fibers.

The highly boronated glasses used in fiberglass are E-glass (named for &quot;Electrical&quot; use, but now the most common fiberglass for general use). E-glass is alumino-borosilicate glass with less than 1% w/w alkali oxides, mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics. Other common high-boron glasses include C-glass, an alkali-lime glass with high boron oxide content, used for glass staple fibers and insulation, and D-glass, a [[borosilicate glass]], named for its low '''D'''ielectric constant).&lt;ref name=ullmann1&gt;

Not all fiberglasses contain boron, but on a global scale, most of the fiberglass used does contain it. Because the ubiquitous use of fiberglass in construction and insulation, boron-containing fiberglasses consume half the global production of boron, and are the single largest commercial boron market.

===Borosilicate glass===
[[File:Schott Duran glassware.jpg|thumb|upright|Borosilicate glassware. Displayed are two beakers and a test tube.]]
[[Borosilicate]] glass, which is typically 12–15% B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, 80% SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and 2% Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, has a low [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] giving it a good resistance to thermal shock. [[Schott AG]]'s &quot;Duran&quot; and [[Owens-Corning]]'s trademarked [[Pyrex]] are two major brand names for this glass, used both in [[laboratory glassware]] and in consumer [[cookware and bakeware]], chiefly for this resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Schott guide to glass| first = H.

===Boron carbide ceramic===
{{main|Boron carbide}}
[[File:Borfig11a.png|thumb|left|150px|Unit cell of B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C. The green sphere and [[icosahedron|icosahedra]] consist of boron atoms, and black spheres are carbon atoms.&lt;ref name=zhangyb28.5c4&gt;{{cite journal|author=Zhang F X, Xu F F, Mori T, Liu Q L, Sato A and Tanaka T|year=2001|title=Crystal structure of new rare-earth boron-rich solids: REB28.5C4|journal=J.

Several boron compounds are known for their extreme hardness and toughness.
[[Boron carbide]] is a ceramic material which is obtained by decomposing B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with carbon in the electric furnace:
:2 B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 7 C → B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C + 6 CO

Boron carbide's structure is only approximately B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;C, and it shows a clear depletion of carbon from this suggested stoichiometric ratio. This is due to its very complex structure. The substance can be seen with [[empirical formula]] B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (i.e., with B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; dodecahedra being a motif), but with less carbon, as the suggested C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; units are replaced with C-B-C chains, and some smaller (B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) octahedra are present as well (see the boron carbide article for structural analysis). The repeating polymer plus semi-crystalline structure of boron carbide gives it great structural strength per weight. It is used in [[vehicle armour|tank armor]], [[bulletproof vest]]s, and numerous other structural applications.

Boron carbide's ability to absorb neutrons without forming long-lived [[radionuclide]]s (especially when doped with extra boron-10) makes the material attractive as an absorbent for neutron radiation arising in nuclear power plants. Nuclear applications of boron carbide include shielding, control rods and shut-down pellets. Within control rods, boron carbide is often powdered, to increase its surface area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first = Alan W.|last = Weimer| title = Carbide, Nitride and Boride Materials Synthesis and Processing| isbn = 0-412-54060-6| year = 1997| publisher = Chapman &amp; Hall (London, New York)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boron carbide and cubic boron nitride powders are widely used as abrasives. [[Boron nitride]] is a material isoelectronic to [[carbon]]. Similar to carbon, it has both hexagonal (soft graphite-like h-BN) and cubic (hard, diamond-like c-BN) forms. h-BN is used as a high temperature component and lubricant. c-BN, also known under commercial name [[borazon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first = R. H.|last = Wentorf|title = Cubic form of boron nitride|journal = J. Chem Phys.|volume = 26|year = 1957| page = 956| doi = 10.1063/1.1745964| issue = 4|bibcode = 1957JChPh..26..956W}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a superior abrasive. Its hardness is only slightly smaller than, but its chemical stability is superior, to that of diamond. [[Heterodiamond]] (also called BCN) is another diamond-like boron compound.

===Boron metal coatings===
Metal [[boride]]s are used for coating tools through [[chemical vapor deposition]] or [[physical vapor deposition]]. Implantation of boron ions into metals and alloys, through [[ion implantation]] or [[ion beam deposition]], results in a spectacular increase in surface resistance and microhardness. Laser alloying has also been successfully used for the same purpose. These borides are an alternative to diamond coated tools, and their (treated) surfaces have similar properties to those of the bulk boride.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Materials Science of Carbides, Nitrides and Borides| author = Gogotsi, Y. G. and Andrievski, R.A.| publisher = Springer| year = 1999| isbn = 0-7923-5707-8| pages = 270–270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[Rhenium diboride]] can be produced at ambient pressures, but is rather expensive because of rhenium. The hardness of ReB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits considerable [[anisotropy]] because of its hexagonal layered structure. Its value is comparable to that of [[tungsten carbide]], [[silicon carbide]], [[titanium diboride]] or [[zirconium diboride]].&lt;ref name=&quot;qin&quot;/&gt;
Similarly, AlMgB&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt; + TiB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; composites possess high hardness and wear resistance and are used in either bulk form or as coatings for components exposed to high temperatures and wear loads.&lt;ref name=&quot;tib1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1016/j.stam.2007.06.009|title = Preparation of titanium diboride TiB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by spark plasma sintering at slow heating rate|year = 2007|last = Schmidt|first = Jürgen|journal = Science and Technology of Advanced Materials|volume = 8|page = 376|last2 = Boehling|first2 = Marian|last3 = Burkhardt|first3 = Ulrich|last4 = Grin|first4 = Yuri|issue = 5|bibcode = 2007STAdM...8..376S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Detergent formulations and bleaching agents===
Borax is used in various household laundry and cleaning products,&lt;ref&gt;{{HPD|136}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the &quot;[[20 Mule Team Borax]]&quot; laundry booster and &quot;[[Boraxo]]&quot; powdered hand soap. It is also present in some [[tooth bleaching]] formulas.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;

[[Sodium perborate]] serves as a source of [[active oxygen]] in many [[detergent]]s, [[laundry detergent]]s, [[cleaning product]]s, and laundry [[bleach (chemical)|bleaches]]. However, despite its name, &quot;Borateem&quot; laundry bleach no longer contains any boron compounds, using [[sodium percarbonate]] instead as a bleaching agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1351/pac197439040547|title = Industrial applications of boron compounds|year = 1974|last1 = Thompson|first1 = R.|journal = Pure and Applied Chemistry|volume = 39|issue = 4|page = 547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semiconductors===
Boron is a useful [[dopant]] for such semiconductors as [[silicon]], [[germanium]], and [[silicon carbide]]. Having one fewer valence electron than the host atom, it donates a [[electron hole|hole]] resulting in [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]] conductivity. Traditional method of introducing boron into semiconductors is via its [[atomic diffusion]] at high temperatures. This process uses either solid (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), liquid (BBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), or gaseous boron sources (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; or BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). However, after the 1970s, it was mostly replaced by [[ion implantation]], which relies mostly on BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as a boron source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|pages = 51–54|title = Fundamentals of semiconductor manufacturing and process control|last = May|first = Gary S.|last2= Spanos|first2=Costas J.|publisher = John Wiley and Sons|year = 2006|isbn=0-471-78406-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boron trichloride gas is also an important chemical in semiconductor industry, however not for doping but rather for [[plasma etching]] of metals and their oxides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|pages = 39–60|title = Semiconductor industry: wafer fab exhaust management|first = J.

===Magnets===
Boron is a component of [[neodymium magnet]]s (Nd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;B), which are among the strongest type of permanent magnet. These magnets are found in a variety of electromechanical and electronic devices, such as [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) medical imaging systems, in compact and relatively small motors and [[actuator]]s.  As examples, computer HDDs (hard disk drives), CD (compact disk) and DVD (digital versatile disk) players rely on neodymium magnet motors to deliver intense rotary power in a remarkably compact package.   In mobile phones 'Neo' magnets provide the magnetic field which allows tiny speakers to deliver appreciable audio power.&lt;ref name=magnet&gt;{{Cite book|page=45|title=Permanent magnet materials and their application| first = Peter|last = Campbell| publisher =Cambridge University Press| year= 1996| isbn=0-521-56688-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological role==
Boron is needed by life. In 2013, a hypothesis suggested it was possible that boron and molybdenum catalyzed the production of [[RNA]] on [[Mars]] with life being transported to Earth via a meteorite around 3 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=mars&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24120-primordial-broth-of-life-was-a-dry-martian-cupasoup.html?cmpid=RSS%7CNSNS%7C2012-GLOBAL%7Clife#.Uh98K5BwaUk|title=Primordial broth of life was a dry Martian cup-a-soup|work=New Scientist|date=29 August 2013|accessdate=2013-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There exists one known boron-containing natural [[antibiotic]], [[boromycin]], isolated from [[streptomyces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Hütter|first1=R.|last2=Keller-Schien|first2=W.|last3=Knüsel|first3=F.|last4=Prelog|first4=V.|last5=Rodgers Jr.|first5=G.

Boron is an essential plant [[nutrient]], required primarily for maintaining the integrity of cell walls. However, high soil concentrations of &gt; 1.0&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million|ppm]] lead to marginal and tip necrosis in leaves as well as poor overall growth performance. Levels as low as 0.8&amp;nbsp;ppm produce these same symptoms in plants that are particularly sensitive to boron in the soil. Nearly all plants, even those somewhat tolerant of soil boron, will show at least some symptoms of boron toxicity when soil boron content is greater than 1.8&amp;nbsp;ppm. When this content exceeds 2.0&amp;nbsp;ppm, few plants will perform well and some may not survive. When boron levels in plant tissue exceed 200&amp;nbsp;ppm, symptoms of boron toxicity are likely to appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://info.ag.uidaho.edu/Resources/PDFs/CIS1085.pdf|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20091001005107/http://info.ag.uidaho.edu/Resources/PDFs/CIS1085.pdf|archivedate = 1 October 2009| publisher = University of Idaho| title = Essential Plant Micronutrients.

As an [[ultratrace element]], boron is necessary for the optimal health of rats. [[Boron deficiency (medicine)|Boron deficiency]] in rats is not easy to produce, since boron is needed by rats in such small amounts that ultrapurified foods and dust filtration of air are required. Boron deficiency manifests in rats as poor coat or hair quality. Presumably boron is necessary to other mammals. No deficiency syndrome in humans has been described. Small amounts of boron occur widely in the diet, and the amounts needed in the diet would, by extension from rodent studies, be very small. The exact physiological role of boron in the animal kingdom is poorly understood.&lt;ref name=&quot;utrace&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ultratrace elements in nutrition: Current knowledge and speculation| first = Forrest H.|last = Nielsen|journal =The Journal of Trace Elements in Experimental Medicine|volume = 11| issue = 2–3 |pages =251–274| doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1520-670X(1998)11:2/3&lt;251::AID-JTRA15&gt;3.0.CO;2-Q|year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boron occurs in all foods produced from plants. Since 1989 its nutritional value has been argued. It is thought that boron plays several biochemical roles in animals, including humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/nutsupdrugs/bor_0040.shtml|title = Boron|accessdate = 2008-09-18|publisher = PDRhealth |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080524054321/http://www.pdrhealth.com/drug_info/nmdrugprofiles/nutsupdrugs/bor_0040.shtml |archivedate = 24 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] conducted an experiment in which postmenopausal women took 3&amp;nbsp;mg of boron a day. The results showed that supplemental boron reduced excretion of calcium by 44%, and activated [[estrogen]] and [[vitamin D]], suggesting a possible role in the suppression of [[osteoporosis]]. However, whether these effects were conventionally nutritional, or medicinal, could not be determined. The U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] states that &quot;Total daily boron intake in normal [[diet (nutrition)|human diets]] ranges from 2.1–4.3&amp;nbsp;mg boron/day.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Total boron|last = Zook|first = E.

[[Congenital endothelial dystrophy type 2]], a rare form of [[corneal dystrophy (human)|corneal dystrophy]], is linked to mutations in [[SLC4A11]] gene that encodes a transporter reportedly regulating the intracellular concentration of boron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1038/ng1824|date=July 2006|author=Vithana, En; Morgan, P; Sundaresan, P; Ebenezer, Nd; Tan, Dt; Mohamed, Md; Anand, S; Khine, Ko; Venkataraman, D; Yong, Vh; Salto-Tellez, M; Venkatraman, A; Guo, K; Hemadevi, B; Srinivasan, M; Prajna, V; Khine, M; Casey, Jr; Inglehearn, Cf; Aung, T|title=Mutations in sodium-borate cotransporter SLC4A11 cause recessive congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED2)|volume=38|issue=7|pages=755–7|issn=1061-4036|pmid=16767101|journal=Nature Genetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analytical quantification===
For determination of boron content in food or materials the [[colorimetry|colorimetric]] ''curcumin method'' is used. Boron is converted to boric acid or [[borate]]s and on reaction with [[curcumin]] in acidic solution, a red colored boron-[[chelate]] complex, [[rosocyanine]], is formed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Corrections-Colorimetric Microdetermination of Boron By The Curcumin-Acetone Solution Method| first = L.|last = Silverman| journal = Anal.

===Health issues and toxicity===
Elemental boron, [[boron trioxide|boron oxide]], [[boric acid]], borates, and many [[organoboron chemistry|organoboron compounds]] are nontoxic to humans and animals (with toxicity similar to that of table salt). The [[median lethal dose|LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;]] (dose at which there is 50% mortality) for animals is about 6&amp;nbsp;g per kg of body weight. Substances with LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; above 2&amp;nbsp;g are considered nontoxic. The minimum lethal dose for humans has not been established. An intake of 4&amp;nbsp;g/day of boric acid was reported without incident, but more than this is considered toxic in more than a few doses. Intakes of more than 0.5&amp;nbsp;grams per day for 50 days cause minor digestive and other problems suggestive of toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1023/A:1004276311956|year=1997|last1=Nielsen|first1=Forrest H.|journal=Plant and Soil|volume=193|issue=2|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Single medical doses of 20&amp;nbsp;g of boric acid for neutron capture therapy have been used without undue toxicity. Fish have survived for 30&amp;nbsp;min in a saturated boric acid solution and can survive longer in strong borax solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|page=385|url=http://books.google.com/?id=imMJJP5T5rsC&amp;pg=PA385|title=Borates| author=Garrett, Donald E. |year=1998|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=0-12-276060-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boric acid is more toxic to insects than to mammals, and is routinely used as an insecticide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klotz 1994 1534–1536&quot;/&gt;

The [[boranes]] (boron hydrogen compounds) and similar gaseous compounds are quite poisonous. As usual, it is not an element that is intrinsically poisonous, but their toxicity depends on structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;borates&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;boron&quot;/&gt;

The boranes are toxic as well as highly [[flammable]] and require special care when handling. Sodium borohydride presents a fire hazard owing to its reducing nature and the liberation of hydrogen on contact with acid. Boron halides are corrosive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc204.htm|title = Environmental Health Criteria 204: Boron|year = 1998| publisher = the [[International Programme on Chemical Safety|IPCS]]| accessdate= 2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
