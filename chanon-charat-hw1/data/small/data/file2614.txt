However, the attention of the media has proven unavoidable in certain cases, his marriage to [[Angelina Jolie]] being a notable example.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.combustiblecelluloid.com/interviews/polishtaf.shtml Interview with Mark Polish, Michael Polish &amp; Billy Bob Thornton - Combustible Celluloid]&lt;/ref&gt; As an influential actor, Thornton is known for his diversity, wide range, and prolificacy, appearing in at least one film per year nearly every year since 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/friday-night-lights-2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Thornton has written a variety of films, usually set in the [[Southern United States]] and mainly co-written with [[Tom Epperson]], including ''[[A Family Thing]]'' (1996) and ''[[The Gift (2000 film)|The Gift]]'' (2000).

In the mid-1980s, Thornton settled in [[Los Angeles]] to pursue his career as an actor, with future writing partner Tom Epperson.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt; He initially had a difficult time succeeding as an actor, and worked in [[telemarketing]], [[offshore construction|offshore]] [[wind farm]]ing,&lt;ref name=&quot;driving&quot; /&gt; and [[fast food]] management between auditioning for acting jobs. He also played drums and sang with South African rock band Jack Hammer. While Thornton worked as a waiter for an industry event, he served film director and screenwriter [[Billy Wilder]]. Thornton struck up a conversation with Wilder, who advised Thornton to consider a career as a screenwriter.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt;

== Career ==

===Acting and filmmaking===
[[File:BillyBobThorntonPointsSXSW2009 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Thornton at the [[South by Southwest]] in [[Austin, Texas]] on March 11, 2008]]
Thornton's first screen role was in 1980's ''South of Reno'', where he played a small role as a counter man in a restaurant. He also made an appearance as a pawn store clerk in the 1987 ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'' episode &quot;The Photographer&quot;. Another one of his early screen roles was as a cast member on the CBS sitcom ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. His role as the villain in 1992's ''[[One False Move]]'', which he also co-wrote, brought him to the attention of critics. He also had small roles in the 1990s films ''[[Indecent Proposal]]'', ''[[On Deadly Ground]]'', ''[[Bound by Honor]]'', and ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]''. He went on to write, direct, and star in the 1996 [[independent film]] ''[[Sling Blade]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt; The film, an expansion of the short film ''[[Some Folks Call It a Sling Blade]]'', introduced the story of a [[mentally handicapped]] man imprisoned for a gruesome and seemingly inexplicable murder.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

''Sling Blade'' garnered international acclaim. Thornton's screenplay earned him an [[Academy Award]] for Best Adapted Screenplay, a [[Writers Guild of America Award]], and an [[Edgar Award]], while his performance received Oscar and [[Screen Actors Guild]] nominations for Best Actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot; /&gt; In 1998, Thornton portrayed the [[James Carville]]-like Richard Jemmons in ''[[Primary Colors (film)|Primary Colors]]''. He adapted the book ''[[All the Pretty Horses (novel)|All the Pretty Horses]]'' into a 2000 [[All the Pretty Horses (film)|film of the same name]]. The negative experience (he was forced to cut more than an hour of footage) led to his decision to never direct another film; a subsequent release, ''[[Daddy and Them]]'', had been filmed earlier. Also in 2000, an early script which he and [[Tom Epperson]] wrote together was made into ''[[The Gift (2000 film)|The Gift]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

In 2000, Thornton appeared in [[Travis Tritt]]'s music video for the song &quot;[[Modern Day Bonnie and Clyde]]&quot;.

Thornton played a malicious mall [[Santa Claus|Santa]] in 2003's ''[[Bad Santa]]'', a [[black comedy]] that performed well at the box office and established him as a leading comic actor, and in the same year, portrayed a womanizing [[President of the United States]] in the British romantic comedy film ''[[Love Actually]]''. He stated that, following the success of ''Bad Santa'', audiences &quot;like to watch him play that kind of guy&quot; and that &quot;casting directors call him up when they need an asshole&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;jamshowbiz&quot; /&gt; He referred to this when he said that &quot;it's kinda that simple... you know how narrow the imagination in this business can be&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailynews&quot;&gt;{{cite web |work=Los Angeles Daily News |title=School is in session |url=http://www.dailynews.com/entertainment/ci_4386629 |accessdate=September 24, 2006}} {{dead link|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Thornton played [[David Crockett]] in ''[[The Alamo (2004 film)|The Alamo]]''. Later that year, he received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] on October 7, 2004. He appeared in the 2006 comic film ''[[School for Scoundrels (2006 film)|School for Scoundrels]]''. In the film, he plays a self-help doctor, which was written specifically for him.&lt;ref name=&quot;jamshowbiz&quot; /&gt; More recent films include 2007 drama ''[[The Astronaut Farmer]]'' and the comedy ''[[Mr. Woodcock]]'', in which he played a [[sadomasochism|sadistic]] gym teacher. In September 2008, he starred in the action film ''[[Eagle Eye]]''. He has also expressed an interest in directing another film, possibly a [[period piece]] about cave explorer [[Floyd Collins]],&lt;ref name=&quot;about.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=About.com |title=Interview with &quot;School for Scoundrels&quot; Star Billy Bob Thornton |url=http://movies.about.com/od/schoolforscoundrels/a/schoolbt091506_2.htm |accessdate=September 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the book ''Trapped! The Story of Floyd Collins''.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

You know, like the big, old, heavy-ass forks and knives, I can't do that. It's the same thing as the antique furniture. I just don't like old stuff. I'm creeped out by it, and I have no explanation why...I don't have a phobia about American antiques, it's mostly French—you know, like the big, old, gold-carved chairs with the [[velvet]] cushions. The [[Louis XIV]] type. That's what creeps me out. I can spot the imitation antiques a mile off. They have a different vibe. Not as much dust.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;independent.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite news |work=Independent.co.uk |title=Interview with Billy Bob Thornton: Acting very strange |date=September 3, 2004 |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/film-and-tv/features/billy-bob-thornton-acting-very-strange-550994.html |accessdate=May 30, 2008 | location=London | first=Tiffany | last=Rose}}&lt;/ref&gt;
