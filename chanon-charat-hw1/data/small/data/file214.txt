I tell you, then, that Mardonius and his army cannot get omens to his liking from the sacrifices. Otherwise you would have fought long before this. Now, however, it is his purpose to pay no heed to the sacrifices, and to attack at the first glimmer of dawn, for he fears, as I surmise, that your numbers will become still greater. Therefore, I urge you to prepare, and if (as may be) Mardonius should delay and not attack, wait patiently where you are; for he has but a few days' provisions left. If, however, this war ends as you wish, then must you take thought how to save me too from slavery, who have done so desperate a deed as this for the sake of Hellas in my desire to declare to you Mardonius' intent so that the barbarians may not attack you suddenly before you yet expect them.

Born in [[Pella]] in 356 BC, Alexander succeeded his father, [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]], to the throne at the age of twenty. He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through Asia and northeast Africa, until by the age of thirty he had created one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires]] of the ancient world, stretching from [[Greece]] to [[Egypt]] and into northwest ancient [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]] | title = Alexander the Great (356–323 BC) | publisher = BBC | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/alexander_the_great.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was undefeated in battle and is considered one of history's most successful military commanders.{{Sfn |Yenne|2010 | page = 159}}

During his youth, Alexander was tutored by the philosopher [[Aristotle]] until the age of 16. When he succeeded his father to the throne in 336&amp;nbsp;BC, after Philip was assassinated, Alexander inherited a strong kingdom and an experienced army. He had been awarded the [[League of Corinth|generalship of Greece]] and used this authority to launch his father's military expansion plans. In 334 BC, he invaded the [[Achaemenid Empire]], ruled [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], and began a [[Wars of Alexander the Great|series of campaigns]] that lasted ten years. Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles, most notably the battles of [[Battle of Issus|Issus]] and [[Battle of Gaugamela|Gaugamela]]. He subsequently overthrew the Persian King [[Darius III]] and conquered the entirety of the [[Achaemenid Empire|First Persian Empire]].{{cref|i}} At that point, his empire stretched from the [[Adriatic Sea]] to the [[Indus River]].

Seeking to reach the &quot;ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea&quot;, he [[Indian campaign of Alexander the Great|invaded India]] in 326 BC, but was eventually forced to turn back at the demand of his troops. Alexander died in [[Babylon]] in 323 BC, the city he planned to establish as his capital, without executing a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]. In the years following his death, a [[Wars of the Diadochi|series of civil wars]] tore his empire apart, resulting in several states ruled by the [[Diadochi]], Alexander's surviving generals and heirs.

Alexander's legacy includes the [[cultural diffusion]] his conquests engendered, such as [[Greco-Buddhism]]. He founded some [[Alexandria (disambiguation)#Other places founded or renamed Alexandria by Alexander the Great|twenty cities that bore his name]]&lt;!-- This links to a disambiguation page on purpose. --&gt;, most notably [[Alexandria]] in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists and the resulting spread of [[Culture of Greece|Greek culture]] in the east resulted in a new [[Hellenistic civilization]], aspects of which were still evident in the traditions of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in the mid-15th century and the presence of [[Cappadocian Greeks|Greek speakers in central]] and [[Pontic Greeks|far eastern Anatolia]] until the 1920s. Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mold of [[Achilles]], and he features prominently in the history and myth of Greek and non-Greek cultures. He became the measure against which military leaders compared themselves, and [[Military academy|military academies]] throughout the world still teach his tactics.{{Sfn |Yenne|2010|page=viii}}{{cref |ii}}

Alexander was born on the sixth day of the ancient Greek month of [[Hekatombaion]], which probably corresponds to 20 July 356 BC, although the exact date is not known,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander_t32.html#7 |title=The birth of Alexander the Great | work = Livius | quote = Alexander was born the sixth of [[Attic calendar|Hekatombaion]]. | accessdate = 16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Pella]], the capital of the [[Macedon|Kingdom of Macedon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title = Alexander of Macedon, 356–323 B.C.: a historical biography |series= Hellenistic culture and society | first = Peter | last = Green |edition= illustrated, revised reprint |publisher= University of California Press |year = 1970 |isbn= 978-0-520-07165-0 |page= xxxiii |url= http://books.google.es/books?id=g6Wl4AKGQkIC&amp;pg=PA559&amp;dq=alexander+the+great+356+OR+355&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=h78uT-uaFYSzhAe436jsCg&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=356&amp;f=false | quote = 356 – Alexander born in Pella.

Several legends surround Alexander's birth and childhood.&lt;ref name= &quot;Roisman 2010 188&quot; /&gt; According to the ancient Greek biographer [[Plutarch]], Olympias, on the eve of the consummation of her marriage to Philip, dreamed that her womb was struck by a thunder bolt, causing a flame that spread &quot;far and wide&quot; before dying away. Some time after the wedding, Philip is said to have seen himself, in a dream, securing his wife's womb with a [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] engraved with a lion's image.&lt;ref name= PA2/&gt; Plutarch offered a variety of interpretations of these dreams: that Olympias was pregnant before her marriage, indicated by the sealing of her womb; or that Alexander's father was [[Zeus]]. Ancient commentators were divided about whether the ambitious Olympias promulgated the story of Alexander's divine parentage, variously claiming that she had told Alexander, or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious.&lt;ref name=PA2 /&gt;

On the day that Alexander was born, Philip was preparing a [[siege]] on the city of [[Potidea]] on the peninsula of [[Chalcidice]]. That same day, Philip received news that his general [[Parmenion]] had defeated the combined [[Illyria]]n and [[Paeonian]] armies, and that his horses had won at the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]. It was also said that on this day, the [[Temple of Artemis]] in [[Ephesus]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Seven Wonders of the World]], burnt down. This led [[Hegesias of Magnesia]] to say that it had burnt down because [[Artemis]] was away, attending the birth of Alexander.&lt;ref name= &quot;Renault, p. 28&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name= P21-B /&gt; Such legends may have emerged when Alexander was king, and possibly at his own instigation, to show that he was superhuman and destined for greatness from conception.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 188&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Alexander &amp; Bucephalus by John Steell.JPG|thumb|left|A statue showing Alexander taming [[Bucephalus]] in [[Edinburgh]]]]
In his early years, Alexander was raised by a nurse, [[Lanike]], sister of Alexander's future general [[Cleitus the Black]]. Later in his childhood, Alexander was tutored by the strict [[Leonidas of Epirus|Leonidas]], a relative of his mother, and by Philip's general [[Lysimachus]].&lt;ref name = M33-34-R /&gt; Alexander was raised in the manner of noble Macedonian youths, learning to read, play the [[lyre]], ride, fight, and hunt.&lt;ref name = &quot;Roisman 2010 186&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p= 186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Alexander was ten years old, a trader from [[Thessaly]] brought Philip a horse, which he offered to sell for thirteen [[Attic talent|talents]]. The horse refused to be mounted and Philip ordered it away. Alexander however, detecting the horse's fear of its own shadow, asked to tame the horse, which he eventually managed.&lt;ref name = &quot;Roisman 2010 188&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch stated that Philip, overjoyed at this display of courage and ambition, kissed his son tearfully, declaring: &quot;My boy, you must find a kingdom big enough for your ambitions. Macedon is too small for you&quot;, and bought the horse for him.&lt;ref name= PA6 /&gt; Alexander named it [[Bucephalas]], meaning &quot;ox-head&quot;. Bucephalas carried Alexander as far as [[India]]. When the animal died (due to old age, according to Plutarch, at age thirty), Alexander named a city after him, [[Alexandria Bucephalous|Bucephala]].&lt;ref name=durant538&gt;{{harvnb|Durant|1966|p=538}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= R64-F /&gt;{{Sfn |Renault|2001|p= 39}}

===Adolescence and education===
When Alexander was 13, Philip began to search for a [[tutor]], and considered such academics as [[Isocrates]] and [[Speusippus]], the latter offering to resign to take up the post. In the end, Philip chose [[Aristotle]] and provided the Temple of the Nymphs at [[Mieza]] as a classroom. In return for teaching Alexander, Philip agreed to rebuild Aristotle's hometown of [[Stageira]], which Philip had razed, and to repopulate it by buying and freeing the ex-citizens who were slaves, or pardoning those who were in exile.&lt;ref name=R65-F/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renault|2001|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCarty|2004|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mieza was like a boarding school for Alexander and the children of Macedonian nobles, such as [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]], [[Hephaistion]], and [[Cassander]]. Many of these students would become his friends and future generals, and are often known as the 'Companions'. Aristotle taught Alexander and his companions about medicine, philosophy, morals, religion, logic, and art. Under Aristotle's tutelage, Alexander developed a passion for the works of [[Homer]], and in particular the ''[[Iliad]]''; Aristotle gave him an annotated copy, which Alexander later carried on his campaigns.&lt;ref name=R65-66-F/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renault|2001|pp=45–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCarty|2004|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philip's heir==

===Regency and ascent of Macedon===
{{Main|Philip II of Macedon|Rise of Macedon}}
[[File:Filip II Macedonia.jpg|thumb|[[Philip II of Macedon]], Alexander's father.]]

At age 16, Alexander's education under Aristotle ended. Philip waged war against [[Byzantium|Byzantion]], leaving Alexander in charge as [[regent]] and [[heir apparent]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 188&quot;/&gt; During Philip's absence, the [[Thracians|Thracian]] [[Maedi]] revolted against Macedonia. Alexander responded quickly, driving them from their territory. He colonized it with Greeks, and founded a city named [[Alexandropolis Maedica|Alexandropolis]].&lt;ref name=R68-F/&gt;{{Sfn |Renault|2001|p=47}}{{Sfn |Bose|2003|p= 43}}

Upon Philip's return, he dispatched Alexander with a small force to subdue revolts in southern [[Thrace]]. Campaigning against the Greek city of [[Perinthus]], Alexander is reported to have saved his father's life. Meanwhile, the city of [[Amphissa (city)|Amphissa]] began to work lands that were sacred to [[Apollo]] near [[Delphi]], a sacrilege that gave Philip the opportunity to further intervene in Greek affairs. Still occupied in Thrace, he ordered Alexander to muster an army for a campaign in Greece. Concerned that other Greek states might intervene, Alexander made it look as though he was preparing to attack Illyria instead. During this turmoil, the Illyrians invaded Macedonia, only to be repelled by Alexander.&lt;ref name=Renault47-49 /&gt;

Philip and his army joined his son in 338 BC, and they marched south through [[Thermopylae]], taking it after stubborn resistance from its Theban garrison. They went on to occupy the city of [[Elatea]], only a few days' march from both Athens and Thebes. The Athenians, led by [[Demosthenes]], voted to seek alliance with Thebes against Macedonia. Both Athens and Philip sent embassies to win Thebes' favor, but Athens won the contest.&lt;ref name=M50-51-R/&gt;{{Sfn |Bose|2003|pp=44–45}}{{Sfn |McCarty|2004|p=23}} Philip marched on Amphissa (ostensibly acting on the request of the [[Amphictyonic League]]), capturing the mercenaries sent there by [[Demosthenes]] and accepting the city's surrender. Philip then returned to Elatea, sending a final offer of peace to Athens and Thebes, who both rejected it.&lt;ref name=M51-R/&gt;{{Sfn |Bose|2003|p=47}}{{Sfn |McCarty | 2004 |p= 24}}

As Philip marched south, his opponents blocked him near [[Chaeronea]], [[Boeotia]]. During the ensuing [[Battle of Chaeronea (338&amp;nbsp;BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]], Philip commanded the right wing and Alexander the left, accompanied by a group of Philip's trusted generals. According to the ancient sources, the two sides fought bitterly for some time. Philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat, counting on the untested Athenian [[hoplites]] to follow, thus breaking their line. Alexander was the first to break the Theban lines, followed by Philip's generals. Having damaged the enemy's cohesion, Philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed them. With the Athenians lost, the Thebans were surrounded. Left to fight alone, they were defeated.&lt;ref name =&quot;DiodXVI&quot; /&gt;

After the victory at Chaeronea, Philip and Alexander marched unopposed into the Peloponnese, welcomed by all cities; however, when they reached [[Sparta]], they were refused, but did not resort to war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.sikyon.com/sparta/history_eg.html |title=History of Ancient Sparta |work= Sikyon |accessdate= 14 November 2009| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20091210135050/http://www.sikyon.com/sparta/history_eg.html | archivedate= 10 December 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], Philip established a &quot;Hellenic Alliance&quot; (modeled on the old [[Second Persian invasion of Greece#Hellenic alliance|anti-Persian alliance]] of the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]), which included most Greek city-states except Sparta. Philip was then named ''[[Hegemon]]'' (often translated as &quot;Supreme Commander&quot;) of this league (known by modern scholars as the [[League of Corinth]]), and announced his plans to attack the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]].&lt;ref name=M54-R/&gt;{{Sfn |McCarty|2004|p= 26}}

===Exile and return===
When Philip returned to Pella, he fell in love with and married [[Cleopatra Eurydice of Macedon|Cleopatra Eurydice]], the niece of his general [[Attalus (general)|Attalus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 179&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage made Alexander's position as heir less secure, since any son of Cleopatra Eurydice would be a fully Macedonian heir, while Alexander was only half-Macedonian.&lt;ref name=McCarty27/&gt; During the wedding banquet, a drunken Attalus publicly prayed to the gods that the union would produce a legitimate heir.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 179&quot;/&gt;

{{Quote|At the wedding of Cleopatra, whom Philip fell in love with and married, she being much too young for him, her uncle Attalus in his drink desired the Macedonians would implore the gods to give them a lawful successor to the kingdom by his niece. This so irritated Alexander, that throwing one of the cups at his head, &quot;You villain,&quot; said he, &quot;what, am I then a bastard?&quot; Then Philip, taking Attalus's part, rose up and would have run his son through; but by good fortune for them both, either his over-hasty rage, or the wine he had drunk, made his foot slip, so that he fell down on the floor. At which Alexander reproachfully insulted over him: &quot;See there,&quot; said he, &quot;the man who makes preparations to pass out of Europe into Asia, overturned in passing from one seat to another.&quot;|Plutarch, describing the feud at Philip's wedding.&lt;ref name=PA9/&gt;}}

Alexander fled Macedon with his mother, dropping her off with her brother, King [[Alexander I of Epirus]] in [[Dodona]], capital of the [[Molossians]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 180&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to Illyria,&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 180&quot;/&gt; where he sought refuge with the Illyrian King and was treated as a guest, despite having defeated them in battle a few years before. However, it appears Philip never intended to disown his politically and militarily trained son.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 180&quot;/&gt; Accordingly, Alexander returned to Macedon after six months due to the efforts of a family friend, [[Demaratus (hetairos)|Demaratus]], who mediated between the two parties.&lt;ref name=P75-B/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renault|2001|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following year, the Persian [[satrap]] (governor) of [[Caria]], [[Pixodarus of Caria|Pixodarus]], offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother, [[Philip Arrhidaeus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 180&quot;/&gt; Olympias and several of Alexander's friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 180&quot;/&gt; Alexander reacted by sending an actor, [[Thessalus (actor)|Thessalus]] of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus that he should not offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander. When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining that he wanted a better bride for him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 180&quot;/&gt; Philip exiled four of Alexander's friends, [[Harpalus]], [[Nearchus]], Ptolemy and [[Erigyius]], and had the Corinthians bring Thessalus to him in chains.&lt;ref name=McCarty27/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renault|2001|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|1980|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==King of Macedon==

===Accession===
[[File:Map Macedonia 336 BC-en.svg|thumb|The Kingdom of Macedon in 336&amp;nbsp;BC.]]
In 336&amp;nbsp;BC, while at [[Vergina|Aegae]] attending the wedding of his daughter [[Cleopatra of Macedon|Cleopatra]] to Olympias's brother, [[Alexander I of Epirus]], Philip was assassinated by the captain of his [[Somatophylax|bodyguards]], [[Pausanias of Orestis|Pausanias]].{{cref|vi}} As Pausanias tried to escape, he tripped over a vine and was killed by his pursuers, including two of Alexander's companions, [[Perdiccas]] and [[Leonnatus]]. Alexander was proclaimed king by the nobles and [[Ancient Macedonian military|army]] at the age of 20.&lt;ref name=N30-31-M/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renault|2001|pp=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox 1980 72&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|1980|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consolidation of power===
Alexander began his reign by eliminating potential rivals to the throne. He had his cousin, the former [[Amyntas IV of Macedon|Amyntas IV]], executed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 190&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had two Macedonian princes from the region of [[Lyncestis]] killed, but spared a third, [[Alexander Lyncestes]]. Olympias had Cleopatra Eurydice and Europa, her daughter by Philip, burned alive. When Alexander learned about this, he was furious. Alexander also ordered the murder of Attalus,&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 190&quot;/&gt; who was in command of the advance guard of the army in Asia Minor and Cleopatra's uncle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green 2007 5–6&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2007|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attalus was at that time corresponding with Demosthenes, regarding the possibility of defecting to Athens. Attalus also had severely insulted Alexander, and following Cleopatra's murder, Alexander may have considered him too dangerous to leave alive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Green 2007 5–6&quot;/&gt; Alexander spared Arrhidaeus, who was by all accounts mentally disabled, possibly as a result of poisoning by Olympias.&lt;ref name=N30-31-M/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox 1980 72&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renault|2001|pp=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News of Philip's death roused many states into revolt, including Thebes, Athens, Thessaly, and the Thracian tribes north of Macedon. When news of the revolts reached Alexander, he responded quickly. Though advised to use diplomacy, Alexander mustered 3,000 Macedonian cavalry and rode south towards Thessaly. He found the Thessalian army occupying the pass between [[Mount Olympus]] and [[Mount Ossa (Greece)|Mount Ossa]], and ordered his men to ride over Mount Ossa. When the Thessalians awoke the next day, they found Alexander in their rear and promptly surrendered, adding their cavalry to Alexander's force. He then continued south towards the [[Peloponnese]].&lt;ref name=N31-M/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Renault, p. 72&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fox|1980|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bose|2003|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander stopped at Thermopylae, where he was recognized as the leader of the Amphictyonic League before heading south to [[Corinth]]. Athens sued for peace and Alexander pardoned the rebels. The famous [[Diogenes and Alexander|encounter between Alexander and Diogenes the Cynic]] occurred during Alexander's stay in Corinth. When Alexander asked Diogenes what he could do for him, the philosopher disdainfully asked Alexander to stand a little to the side, as he was blocking the sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stoneman|2004|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reply apparently delighted Alexander, who is reported to have said &quot;But verily, if I were not Alexander, I would like to be Diogenes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dillon|2004|page=187–188}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Corinth, Alexander took the title of ''Hegemon'' (&quot;leader&quot;) and, like Philip, was appointed commander for the coming war against Persia. He also received news of a Thracian uprising.&lt;ref name=&quot;Renault, p. 72&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=P96-Bose/&gt;

===Balkan campaign===
{{Main|Alexander's Balkan campaign}}
Before crossing to Asia, Alexander wanted to safeguard his northern borders. In the spring of 335&amp;nbsp;BC, he advanced to suppress several revolts. Starting from [[Amphipolis]], he traveled east into the country of the &quot;Independent Thracians&quot;; and at [[Haemus Mons|Mount Haemus]], the Macedonian army attacked and defeated the Thracian forces manning the heights.&lt;ref name=&quot;I, 1&quot;/&gt; The Macedonians marched into the country of the [[Triballi]], and defeated their army near the Lyginus river&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=I, 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a [[List of tributaries of the Danube|tributary of the Danube]]). Alexander then marched for three days to the [[Danube]], encountering the [[Getae]] tribe on the opposite shore. Crossing the river at night, he surprised them and forced their army to retreat after the first cavalry [[skirmish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=I, 3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renault|2001|pp=73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

News then reached Alexander that [[Cleitus the Illyrian|Cleitus]], King of Illyria, and [[King Glaukias]] of the [[Taulanti]] were in open revolt against his authority. Marching west into Illyria, Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing the two rulers to flee with their troops. With these victories, he secured his northern frontier.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=I, 5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renault|2001|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Alexander campaigned north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once again. Alexander immediately headed south.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 192&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the other cities again hesitated, Thebes decided to fight. The Theban resistance was ineffective, and Alexander razed the city and divided its territory between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens, leaving all of Greece temporarily at peace.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 192&quot;/&gt; Alexander then set out on his Asian campaign, leaving [[Antipater]] as regent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 199&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia Minor===
{{further|Battle of the Granicus|Siege of Halicarnassus|Siege of Miletus}}
[[File:MacedonEmpire.jpg|thumb|Map of Alexander's empire and his route.]]

Alexander's army crossed the [[Hellespont]] in 334&amp;nbsp;BC with approximately 48,100 soldiers, 6,100 cavalry and a fleet of 120 ships with crews numbering 38,000,&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 192&quot;/&gt; drawn from Macedon and various Greek city-states, mercenaries, and feudally raised soldiers from [[Thrace]], [[Paionia]], and [[Illyria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=I, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; (However, [[Arrian]], who used [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] as a source, said that Alexander crossed with more than 5,000 horse and 30,000 foot; [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] quoted the same totals, but listed 5,100 horse and 32,000 foot. Diodorus also referred to an advance force already present in Asia, which [[Polyaenus]], in his Stratagems of War (5.44.4), said numbered 10,000 men.) He showed his intent to conquer the entirety of the Persian Empire by throwing a spear into Asian soil and saying he accepted Asia as a gift from the gods.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 192&quot;/&gt; This also showed Alexander's eagerness to fight, in contrast to his father's preference for diplomacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 192&quot;/&gt;

After an initial victory against Persian forces at the [[Battle of the Granicus]], Alexander accepted the surrender of the Persian provincial capital and treasury of [[Sardis]]; he then proceeded along the [[Ionia]]n coast. Though Alexander believed in his divine right to expend the lives of men in battle, he did experience sorrow, as those who died were rewarded generously: &quot;To the relatives of his fallen, Alexander granted immunity from taxation and public service&quot;. Whether it was his own warriors or the Persian forces opposing him, Alexander chose to respect those who died. He even went so far to set up statues to honor and respect these people. Though this did not directly influence the culture of the Persians they did not feel the need to begin a rebellion as their men and rulers were treated with proper respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=I, 13–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Halicarnassus]], in [[Caria]], Alexander successfully waged the first of many [[siege]]s, eventually forcing his opponents, the mercenary captain [[Memnon of Rhodes]] and the Persian [[satrap]] of Caria, [[Orontobates]], to withdraw by sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=I, 20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander left the government of Caria to [[Ada of Caria|Ada]], who adopted Alexander.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arrian 1976 loc=I, 23&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=I, 23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Halicarnassus, Alexander proceeded into mountainous [[Lycia]] and the [[Pamphylia]]n plain, asserting control over all coastal cities to deny the Persians naval bases. From Pamphylia onwards the coast held no major ports and Alexander moved inland. At [[Termessos]], Alexander humbled but did not storm the [[Pisidia]]n city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=I, 27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the ancient Phrygian capital of [[Gordium]], Alexander &quot;undid&quot; the hitherto unsolvable [[Gordian Knot]], a feat said to await the future &quot;king of [[Asia Minor|Asia]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=I, 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the story, Alexander proclaimed that it did not matter how the knot was undone and hacked it apart with his sword.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2007|p=351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Levant and Syria===
{{further|Battle of Issus|Siege of Tyre (332 BC)}}
[[File:Battle of Issus.jpg|thumb|Detail of Alexander Mosaic, showing [[Battle of Issus]], from the [[House of the Faun]], Pompeii.]]

Alexander journeyed south but was met by Darius' significantly larger army which he easily defeated, causing Darius to panic. Although he was chased by some troops, &quot;Alexander treated them (his family) with the respect out of consideration&quot;, which demonstrated his continued generosity and kindness towards those he conquered.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=I, 6–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darius fled the battle, causing his army to collapse, and left behind his wife, his two daughters, his mother [[Sisygambis]], and a fabulous treasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=I, 11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He offered a [[peace treaty]] that included the lands he had already lost, and a ransom of 10,000 [[Attic talent|talents]] for his family. Alexander replied that since he was now king of Asia, it was he alone who decided territorial divisions.

Alexander the Great, although a generous man in victory, eventually recognized the power that he was capable of when he would defeat an enemy in war. Following the siege of Tyre in 332, the enemy he defeated, Darius, attempted to present terms of unconditional surrender but Alexander became ruthless. He realized that he had control and could receive much more. Darius was thus forced to come back. &quot;This time the offer was impressive. Darius offered all territory as a far the Euphrates… a colossal ransom of 30,000 talents for his family…invited to marry his eldest daughter&quot;. This new change in diplomatic relations induced panic among the leaders of the surrounding nations, as they feared a similar defeat. This led some barbarian cultures simply choosing to abdicate power to Alexander in order to avoid certain death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=I, 3–4 II, 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander proceeded to take possession of [[Ancient Syria|Syria]], and most of the coast of the [[Levant]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Arrian 1976 loc=I, 23&quot;/&gt; In the following year, 332&amp;nbsp;BC, he was forced to attack [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], which he captured after a long and difficult [[Siege of Tyre (332 BC)|siege]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=II, 16–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gunther|2007|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander massacred the men of military age and sold the women and children into [[slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sabin|van Wees|Whitby|2007|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
{{further|Siege of Gaza}}
[[File:Name of Alexander the Great in Hieroglyphs circa 330 BCE.jpg|thumb|Name of Alexander the Great in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] (written from right to left), c. 330&amp;nbsp;BC, Egypt. [[Louvre Museum]].]]

When Alexander destroyed Tyre, most of the towns on the route to Egypt quickly capitulated, with the exception of [[Gaza City|Gaza]]. The stronghold at Gaza was heavily fortified and built on a hill, requiring a siege. Alexander came upon the city only to be met with a surprising resistance and fortification. When &quot;his engineers pointed out to him that because of the height of the mound it would be impossible… this encouraged Alexander all the more to make the attempt&quot;. The divine right that Alexander believed he had gave him confidence of a miracle occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=II, 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; After three unsuccessful assaults, the stronghold fell, but not before Alexander had received a serious shoulder wound. As in Tyre, men of military age were put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=II, 26–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jerusalem opened its gates in surrender, and according to [[Josephus]], Alexander was shown the [[Book of Daniel|Book of Daniel's]] prophecy, presumably chapter 8, which described a mighty Greek king who would conquer the Persian Empire. He spared Jerusalem and pushed south into Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, [[Antiquities of the Jews|Jewish Antiquities]], XI, 337 [viii, 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander advanced on Egypt in later 332&amp;nbsp;BC, where he was regarded as a liberator.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ring|Salkin|Berney|Schellinger|1994|pp=49, 320}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was pronounced the new &quot;master of the Universe&quot; and son of the deity of [[Amun]] at the [[Oracle]] of [[Siwa Oasis]] in the [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] desert.&lt;ref name=grimal/&gt; Henceforth, Alexander often referred to [[Zeus-Ammon]] as his true father, and subsequent currency depicted him adorned with rams horn as a symbol of his divinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dahmen|2007|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his stay in Egypt, he founded [[Alexandria|Alexandria-by-Egypt]], which would become the prosperous capital of the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=III, 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assyria and Babylonia===
{{further|Battle of Gaugamela}}
Leaving Egypt in 331&amp;nbsp;BC, Alexander marched eastward into [[Mesopotamia]] (now northern [[Iraq]]) and again defeated Darius, at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=III 7–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darius once more fled the field, and Alexander chased him as far as [[Arbil|Arbela]]. Gaugamela would be the final and decisive encounter between the two. Darius fled over the mountains to [[Ecbatana]] (modern [[Hamedan]]), while Alexander captured [[Babylon]].&lt;ref name=AIII16/&gt;

===Persia===
{{further|Battle of the Persian Gate}}
[[File:2persian gate wall.JPG|thumb|Site of the [[Persian Gate]]; the road was built in the 1990s.]]

From Babylon, Alexander went to [[Susa]], one of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] capitals, and captured its legendary treasury.&lt;ref name=AIII16/&gt; He sent the bulk of his army to the Persian ceremonial capital of [[Persepolis]] via the [[Royal Road]]. Alexander himself took selected troops on the direct route to the city. He had to storm the pass of the [[Persian Gates]] (in the modern [[Zagros Mountains]]) which had been blocked by a Persian army under [[Ariobarzanes (satrap of Persis)|Ariobarzanes]] and then hurried to Persepolis before its garrison could loot the treasury.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Arrian|1976|loc=III, 18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On entering Persepolis, Alexander allowed his troops to loot the city for several days.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Foreman|2004|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander stayed in Persepolis for five months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morkot 1996 121&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Morkot|1996|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his stay a fire broke out in the eastern palace of [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] and spread to the rest of the city. Possible causes include a drunken accident or deliberate revenge for the burning of the [[Acropolis of Athens]] during the [[Greco-Persian Wars|Second Persian War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;H83&quot;/&gt;

===Fall of the Empire and the East===
[[File:AlexanderCoin.jpg|thumb|[[Silver coin]] of Alexander wearing the lion scalp of [[Herakles]], [[British Museum]].]]

Alexander then chased Darius, first into Media, and then Parthia.{{Sfn |Arrian|1976|loc= III, 19–20}} The Persian king no longer controlled his own destiny, and was taken prisoner by [[Bessus]], his [[Bactria]]n satrap and kinsman.{{Sfn |Arrian|1976| loc= III, 21}} As Alexander approached, Bessus had his men fatally stab the Great King and then declared himself Darius' successor as Artaxerxes V, before retreating into Central Asia to launch a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] campaign against Alexander.{{Sfn |Arrian|1976|loc=III, 21, 25}} Alexander buried Darius' remains next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral.{{Sfn | Arrian| 1976 | loc = III, 22}} He claimed that, while dying, Darius had named him as his successor to the Achaemenid throne.&lt;ref name=BriefLife81/&gt; The Achaemenid Empire is normally considered to have fallen with Darius.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander10.html|title=The end of Persia|publisher = Livius |accessdate=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander viewed Bessus as a usurper and set out to defeat him. This campaign, initially against Bessus, turned into a grand tour of central Asia. Alexander founded a series of new cities, all called Alexandria, including modern [[Kandahar]] in Afghanistan, and [[Alexandria Eschate]] (&quot;The Furthest&quot;) in modern [[Tajikistan]]. The campaign took Alexander through [[Media (region)|Media]], [[Parthia]], [[Aria (satrapy)|Aria]] (West Afghanistan), [[Drangiana]], [[Arachosia]] (South and Central Afghanistan), [[Bactria]] (North and Central Afghanistan), and [[Scythia]].{{Sfn |Arrian|1976|loc=III, 23–25, 27–30; IV, 1–7}}

[[Spitamenes]], who held an undefined position in the satrapy of Sogdiana, in 329 BC betrayed Bessus to [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]], one of Alexander's trusted companions, and Bessus was executed.{{Sfn |Arrian|1976|loc= III, 30}} However, when, at some point later, Alexander was on the [[Syr Darya|Jaxartes]] dealing with an incursion by a horse nomad army, Spitamenes raised Sogdiana in revolt. Alexander personally defeated the Scythians at the [[Battle of Jaxartes]] and immediately launched a campaign against Spitamenes, defeating him in the Battle of Gabai. After the defeat, Spitamenes was killed by his own men, who then sued for peace.{{Sfn |Arrian|1976|loc = IV, 5–6, 16–17}}

===Problems and plots===

During this time, Alexander took the Persian title &quot;King of Kings&quot; (''Shahanshah'') and adopted some elements of Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of ''[[proskynesis]]'', either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the ground, that Persians showed to their social superiors.&lt;ref name=AVII11/&gt; The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of [[deities]] and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morkot 1996 111&quot; /&gt;

A plot against his life was revealed, and one of his officers, [[Philotas]], was executed for failing to alert Alexander. The death of the son necessitated the death of the father, and thus [[Parmenion]], who had been charged with guarding the treasury at [[Ecbatana]], was assassinated at Alexander's command, to prevent attempts at vengeance. Most infamously, Alexander personally killed the man who had saved his life at Granicus, [[Cleitus the Black]], during a violent drunken altercation at [[Maracanda]] (modern day [[Samarkand]] in [[Uzbekistan]]), in which Cleitus accused Alexander of several judgemental mistakes and most especially, of having forgotten the Macedonian ways in favour of a corrupt oriental lifestyle.&lt;ref name=BriefLife99/&gt;

Later, in the Central Asian campaign, a second plot against his life was revealed, this one instigated by his own royal [[page (occupation)|pages]]. His official historian, [[Callisthenes]] of [[Olynthus]], was implicated in the plot; however, historians have yet to reach a consensus regarding this involvement.&lt;!--historian solidarity?--&gt; Callisthenes had fallen out of favor by leading the opposition to the attempt to introduce proskynesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heckel|Tritle|2009|pp=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Macedon in Alexander's absence===
When Alexander set out for Asia, he left his general [[Antipater]], an experienced military and political leader and part of Philip II's &quot;Old Guard&quot;, in charge of Macedon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 199&quot;/&gt; Alexander's sacking of Thebes ensured that Greece remained quiet during his absence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 199&quot;/&gt; The one exception was a call to arms by Spartan king [[Agis III]] in 331&amp;nbsp;BC, whom Antipater defeated and killed in battle at [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]] the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 199&quot;/&gt; Antipater referred the Spartans' punishment to the League of Corinth, which then deferred to Alexander, who chose to pardon them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also considerable friction between Antipater and Olympias, and each complained to Alexander about the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, Greece enjoyed a period of peace and prosperity during Alexander's campaign in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander sent back vast sums from his conquest, which stimulated the economy and increased trade across his empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Alexander's constant demands for troops and the migration of Macedonians throughout his empire depleted Macedon's manpower, greatly weakening it in the years after Alexander, and ultimately led to its subjugation by Rome.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 186&quot;/&gt;

==Indian campaign==
{{Main|Indian campaign of Alexander the Great}}

===Invasion of the Indian subcontinent===
[[File:The phalanx attacking the centre in the battle of the Hydaspes by Andre Castaigne (1898-1899).jpg|thumb|left|''The [[phalanx]] attacking the centre in the [[Battle of the Hydaspes]]'' by André Castaigne (1898–1899)]]

After the death of [[Spitamenes]] and his marriage to Roxana (Roshanak in [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]]) to cement relations with his new satrapies, Alexander turned to the [[Indian subcontinent]]. He invited the [[tribal chief|chieftains]] of the former satrapy of [[Gandhara]], in the north of what is now [[Pakistan]], to come to him and submit to his authority. [[Omphis]](Indian name [[Ambhi]] Kumar), the ruler of [[Taxila]], whose kingdom extended from the [[Indus]] to the [[Jhelum River|Hydaspes (Jhelum)]], complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the [[Aspasioi]] and [[Assakenoi]] sections of the [[Kambojas]] (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit.&lt;ref name=Ind118/&gt; [[Ambhi]] hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all his forces at his disposal. Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of &quot;Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1000 talents in gold&quot;. Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted [[Hephaestion]] and [[Perdiccas]] in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at Hund (Fox 1973), supplied their troops with provisions, and received Alexander himself, and his whole army, in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality.

On the subsequent advance of the [[Macedon]]ian king, Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5000 men and took part in the [[battle of the Hydaspes River]]. After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of Porus, to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy. Subsequently, however, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; and Taxiles, after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes, was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus. A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of [[Philip (son of Machatas)|Philip]], son of Machatas; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at [[Treaty of Triparadisus|Triparadisus]], 321 BC.

In the winter of 327/326&amp;nbsp;BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against these clans; the Aspasioi of [[Kunar Valley|Kunar]] [[valley]]s, the Guraeans of the [[Panjkora|Guraeus]] valley, and the Assakenoi of the [[Swat (Pakistan)|Swat]] and [[Buner Valley|Buner]] valleys.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Narain|1965|pp=155–165}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart, but eventually the Aspasioi lost. Alexander then faced the Assakenoi, who fought in the strongholds of Massaga, Ora and [[Aornos]].&lt;ref name=Ind118/&gt;

The fort of Massaga was reduced only after days of bloody fighting, in which Alexander was wounded seriously in the ankle. According to [[Quintus Curtius Rufus|Curtius]], &quot;Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga, but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McCrindle|1997|p=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar slaughter followed at Ora. In the aftermath of Massaga and Ora, numerous Assakenians fled to the fortress of [[Aornos]]. Alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hill-fort after four bloody days.&lt;ref name=Ind118/&gt;

After Aornos, Alexander crossed the Indus and fought and won an epic battle against [[King Porus]], who ruled a region in the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], in the [[Battle of the Hydaspes]] in 326&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=Ind124/&gt; Alexander was impressed by Porus's bravery, and made him an ally. He appointed Porus as satrap, and added to Porus' territory land that he did not previously own. Choosing a local helped him control these lands so distant from Greece.&lt;ref name=Ind126/&gt; Alexander founded two cities on opposite sides of the [[Jhelum River|Hydaspes]] river, naming one [[Alexandria Bucephalous|Bucephala]], in honor of his horse, who died around this time.&lt;ref name=BriefLife120/&gt; The other was [[Nicaea (Punjab)|Nicaea]] (Victory), thought to be located at the site of modern day [[Mong, Punjab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Worthington|2003|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolt of the army===
[[File:AlexanderConquestsInIndia.jpg|thumb|Alexander's invasion of the Indian subcontinent]]

East of Porus' kingdom, near the [[Ganges River]], were the [[Nanda dynasty|Nanda Empire]] of [[Magadha]] and further east the [[Gangaridai|Gangaridai Empire]] (of modern day [[Bangladesh]]). Fearing the prospect of facing other large armies and exhausted by years of campaigning, Alexander's army mutinied at the [[Beas River|Hyphasis River (Beas)]], refusing to march farther east. This river thus marks the easternmost extent of Alexander's conquests.&lt;ref name=Ind129/&gt;
{{quote|As for the Macedonians, however, their struggle with Porus blunted their courage and stayed their further advance into India. For having had all they could do to repulse an enemy who mustered only twenty thousand infantry and two thousand horse, they violently opposed Alexander when he insisted on crossing the river Ganges also, the width of which, as they learned, was thirty-two furlongs, its depth a hundred fathoms, while its banks on the further side were covered with multitudes of [[Man-at-arms|men-at-arms]] and horsemen and elephants. For they were told that the kings of the Ganderites and Praesii were awaiting them with eighty thousand horsemen, two hundred thousand footmen, eight thousand chariots, and six thousand [[war elephant]]s.&lt;ref name=PA62/&gt;}}

Alexander tried to persuade his soldiers to march farther, but his general [[Coenus (general)|Coenus]] pleaded with him to change his opinion and return; the men, he said, &quot;longed to again see their parents, their wives and children, their homeland&quot;. Alexander eventually agreed and turned south, marching along the [[Indus river|Indus]]. Along the way his army conquered the [[Malhi]] (in modern day [[Multan]]) and other Indian tribes and sustained an injury during the siege.&lt;ref name=Ind137/&gt;

Alexander sent much of his army to [[Kerman province|Carmania]] (modern southern [[Iran]]) with general [[Craterus]], and commissioned a fleet to explore the [[Persian Gulf]] shore under his admiral [[Nearchus]], while he led the rest back to Persia through the more difficult southern route along the [[Gedrosia|Gedrosian Desert]] and [[Makran]].&lt;ref name=Ind141/&gt; Alexander reached Susa in 324&amp;nbsp;BC, but not before losing many men to the harsh desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morkot|1996|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Last years in Persia==
[[File:Alexander and Hephaestion.jpg|thumb|left|Alexander, left, and [[Hephaestion]], right]]

Discovering that many of his [[satrap]]s and military governors had misbehaved in his absence, Alexander executed several of them as examples on his way to [[Susa]].&lt;ref name=AVI27/&gt;&lt;ref name=AVII4/&gt; As a gesture of thanks, he paid off the debts of his soldiers, and announced that he would send over-aged and disabled veterans back to Macedon, led by Craterus. His troops misunderstood his intention and mutinied at the town of [[Opis]]. They refused to be sent away and criticized his adoption of Persian customs and dress and the introduction of Persian officers and soldiers into Macedonian units.&lt;ref name=&quot;Worthington 2003 307&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Worthington|2003|pp=307–308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After three days, unable to persuade his men to back down, Alexander gave Persians command posts in the army and conferred Macedonian military titles upon Persian units. The Macedonians quickly begged forgiveness, which Alexander accepted, and held a great banquet for several thousand of his men at which he and they ate together.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 194&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to craft a lasting harmony between his Macedonian and Persian subjects, Alexander held a mass marriage of his senior officers to Persian and other noblewomen at Susa, but few of those marriages seem to have lasted much beyond a year.&lt;ref name=AVII4/&gt; Meanwhile, upon his return, Alexander learned that guards of the tomb of [[Cyrus the Great]] had desecrated it, and swiftly executed them.&lt;ref name=AVI29/&gt;

After Alexander traveled to Ecbatana to retrieve the bulk of the Persian treasure, his closest friend and possible lover, [[Hephaestion]], died of illness or poisoning.&lt;ref name=AVII14/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berkley|2006|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander, and he ordered the preparation of an expensive [[funeral pyre]] in Babylon, as well as a decree for public mourning.&lt;ref name=AVII14/&gt; Back in Babylon, Alexander planned a series of new campaigns, beginning with an invasion of Arabia, but he would not have a chance to realize them, as he died shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=AVII19/&gt;

==Death and succession==
{{main|Death of Alexander the Great}}
[[File:Babylonian astronomical diary recording the death of Alexander the Great (British Museum).jpg|thumb|A [[Babylonian astronomical diary]] (c. 323–322&amp;nbsp;BC) recording the death of Alexander ([[British Museum]], London)]]
[[File:Mid-nineteenth century reconstruction of Alexander's catafalque based on the description by Diodorus.jpg|thumb|19th century depiction of Alexander's funeral procession based on the description of Diodorus]]
On either 10 or 11 June 323&amp;nbsp;BC, Alexander died in the palace of [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], in [[Babylon]], at age 32.&lt;ref name=Depuydt/&gt; There are two different versions of Alexander's death and details of the death differ slightly in each. [[Plutarch]]'s account is that roughly 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained admiral [[Nearchus]], and spent the night and next day drinking with [[Medius of Larissa]].&lt;ref name=P75 /&gt; He developed a fever, which worsened until he was unable to speak. The common soldiers, anxious about his health, were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them.{{Sfn |Wood|2001|pp= 2267–70}} In the second account, Diodorus recounts that Alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of [[Heracles]], followed by 11 days of weakness; he did not develop a fever and died after some agony.&lt;ref name= DSXVII117/&gt; Arrian also mentioned this as an alternative, but [[Plutarch]] specifically denied this claim.&lt;ref name=P75 /&gt;

Given the propensity of the Macedonian aristocracy to assassination,&lt;ref name=g1/&gt; foul play featured in multiple accounts of his death. Diodorus, Plutarch, Arrian and Justin all mentioned the theory that Alexander was poisoned. Justin stated that Alexander was the victim of a poisoning conspiracy, Plutarch dismissed it as a fabrication,&lt;ref name= PA77/&gt; while both Diodorus and Arrian noted that they mentioned it only for the sake of completeness.&lt;ref name=DSXVII117/&gt;&lt;ref name=AVII27 /&gt; The accounts were nevertheless fairly consistent in designating Antipater, recently removed as Macedonian viceroy, and at odds with Olympias, as the head of the alleged plot. Perhaps taking his summons to Babylon as a death sentence,&lt;ref name=g23/&gt; and having seen the fate of Parmenion and Philotas,&lt;ref name=DSXVII118 /&gt; Antipater purportedly arranged for Alexander to be poisoned by his son Iollas, who was Alexander's wine-pourer.&lt;ref name=AVII27/&gt;&lt;ref name=DSXVII118/&gt; There was even a suggestion that Aristotle may have participated.&lt;ref name=AVII27 /&gt;

It is claimed that the strongest argument against the poison theory is the fact that twelve days passed between the start of his illness and his death; such long-acting poisons were probably not available.{{Sfn |Fox|2006|loc= chapter 32}} However, in 2003 Dr Leo Schep From The New Zealand National Poisons Centre proposed in a BBC documentary investigating his death that the plant white hellebore (''[[Veratrum album]]'') may have been used to poison Alexander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= | date= 16 October 2003| url = http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/2003/10/16/alexander/ |title= NZ scientist's detective work may reveal how Alexander died | accessdate=15 January 2014| location = Dunedin | work=The Royal Society of New Zealand}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn |Cawthorne|2004|p= 138}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bursztajn | first = Harold J | title = Dead Men Talking | journal = Harvard Medical Alumni Bulletin | year = 2005 | issue = Spring | url= http://www.forensic-psych.com/articles/artDeadMenTalking.php | accessdate =16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 Dr Leo Schep published this theory in the peer-reviewed medical journal [[Clinical Toxicology]]; in this journal article it was suggested Alexander's wine was spiked with ''Veratrum album'', a plant known to the Ancient Greeks, which produces poisoning symptoms that match the course of events as described in the ''[[Alexander Romance]]''.&lt;ref name=schep&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schep LJ, Slaughter RJ, Vale JA, Wheatley P |title=Was the death of Alexander the Great due to poisoning?

Several [[natural causes]] (diseases) have been suggested, including [[malaria]] and [[typhoid fever]]. A 1998 article in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' attributed his death to typhoid fever complicated by [[bowel perforation]] and ascending [[paralysis]].&lt;ref name= AMD /&gt; Another recent analysis suggested [[pyogenic spondylitis]] or [[meningitis]].&lt;ref name=ashrafian/&gt; Other illnesses fit the symptoms, including [[acute pancreatitis]] and [[West Nile virus]].&lt;ref name=ref1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Sbarounis| first = CN | title=Did Alexander the Great die of acute pancreatitis? |journal= J Clin Gastroenterol |volume= 24 | pages = 294–96 |year=2007 |doi=10.1097/00004836-199706000-00031 |pmid=9252868 |issue= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural-cause theories also tend to emphasise that Alexander's health may have been in general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds. The anguish that Alexander felt after [[Hephaestion]]'s death may also have contributed to his declining health.&lt;ref name=AMD/&gt;

===After death===
{{see also|Tomb of Alexander the Great}}
[[File:Alexander Sarcophagus.jpg|thumb|Detail of Alexander on the [[Alexander Sarcophagus]].]]

Alexander's body was laid in a gold anthropoid [[sarcophagus]] that was filled with honey, which was in turn placed in a gold casket.&lt;ref name=sarco1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://casswww.ucsd.edu/archive/personal/ron/CVNC/byline/bugs_96mar.html |date=Mar 1996 | title = Bayfront Byline Bug Walk |publisher = UCSD | accessdate= 25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aelian, a seer called Aristander foretold that the land where Alexander was laid to rest &quot;would be happy and unvanquishable forever&quot;.&lt;ref name=Aelian/&gt; Perhaps more likely, the successors may have seen possession of the body as a symbol of legitimacy, since burying the prior king was a [[Royal Prerogative|royal prerogative]].{{Sfn |Green|2007|p= 32}}

While Alexander's funeral cortege was on its way to Macedon, Ptolemy seized it and took it temporarily to Memphis.&lt;ref name = sarco1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aelian/&gt; His successor, [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], transferred the sarcophagus to Alexandria, where it remained until at least [[late Antiquity]]. [[Ptolemy IX Lathyros]], one of Ptolemy's final successors, replaced Alexander's sarcophagus with a glass one so he could convert the original to coinage.&lt;ref name=sarco2 /&gt; The recent discovery of an enormous tomb in northern Greece, at [[Amphipolis]], dating to the time of Alexander the Great &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-29239529&lt;/ref&gt; has given rise to speculation that its original intent was to be the burial place of Alexander. This would fit with the intended destination of Alexander's funeral cortege.

[[Pompey]], [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Augustus]] all visited the tomb in Alexandria, where Augustus, allegedly, accidentally knocked the nose off. [[Caligula]] was said to have taken Alexander's breastplate from the tomb for his own use. Around AD 200, Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] closed Alexander's tomb to the public. His son and successor, [[Caracalla]], a great admirer, visited the tomb during his own reign. After this, details on the fate of the tomb are hazy.&lt;ref name=sarco2 /&gt;

The so-called &quot;[[Alexander Sarcophagus]]&quot;, discovered near [[Sidon]] and now in the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum]], is so named not because it was thought to have contained Alexander's remains, but because its bas-reliefs depict Alexander and his companions fighting the Persians and hunting. It was originally thought to have been the sarcophagus of [[Abdalonymus]] (died 311 BC), the king of Sidon appointed by Alexander immediately following the [[battle of Issus]] in 331.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Studniczka|1894|pp=226ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bieber|first= M |title=The Portraits of Alexander |journal=Greece &amp; Rome, Second Series |year=1965 |pages=183–188|volume = 12.2 |doi=10.1017/s0017383500015345}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recently, it has been suggested that it may date from earlier than Abdalonymus' death.

===Division of the empire===
{{main|Diadochi}}
[[File:Diadochen1.png|thumb|Kingdoms of the [[Diadochi]] in 281&amp;nbsp;BC: the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] (dark blue), the [[Seleucid Empire]] (yellow), [[Pergamon|Kingdom of Pergamon]] (orange), and Macedonia (green). Also shown are the [[Roman Republic]] (light blue), the [[Carthaginian Empire|Carthaginian Republic]] (purple), and the [[Epirus (ancient state)|Kingdom of Epirus]] (red).]]

Alexander's death was so sudden that when reports of his death reached Greece, they were not immediately believed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 199&quot;/&gt; Alexander had no obvious or legitimate heir, his son Alexander IV by Roxane being born after Alexander's death.&lt;ref name=g24/&gt; According to Diodorus, Alexander's companions asked him on his deathbed to whom he bequeathed his kingdom; his laconic reply was &quot;tôi kratistôi&quot;—&quot;to the strongest&quot;.&lt;ref name=DSXVII117/&gt;

Arrian and Plutarch claimed that Alexander was speechless by this point, implying that this was an apocryphal story.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|2007|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diodorus, Curtius and Justin offered the more plausible story that Alexander passed his [[Seal (device)|signet ring]] to [[Perdiccas]], a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry, in front of witnesses, thereby nominating him.&lt;ref name=DSXVII117/&gt;&lt;ref name=g24/&gt;

Perdiccas initially did not claim power, instead suggesting that Roxane's baby would be king, if male; with himself, [[Craterus]], Leonnatus, and Antipater as guardians. However, the infantry, under the command of [[Meleager (general)|Meleager]], rejected this arrangement since they had been excluded from the discussion. Instead, they supported Alexander's half-brother Philip Arrhidaeus. Eventually, the two sides reconciled, and after the birth of Alexander IV, he and Philip III were appointed joint kings, albeit in name only.&lt;ref name=g26/&gt;

Dissension and rivalry soon afflicted the Macedonians, however. The satrapies handed out by Perdiccas at the [[Partition of Babylon]] became power bases each general used to bid for power. After the assassination of Perdiccas in 321&amp;nbsp;BC, Macedonian unity collapsed, and 40&amp;nbsp;years of war between &quot;The Successors&quot; (''Diadochi'') ensued before the Hellenistic world settled into four stable power blocks: [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic]] Egypt, [[Seleucid Empire|Selucid]] Mesopotamia and Central Asia, [[Attalid dynasty|Attalid]] Anatolia, and [[Antigonid dynasty|Antigonid]] Macedon. In the process, both Alexander IV and Philip III were murdered.&lt;ref name=g29/&gt;

===Testament===
[[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] stated that Alexander had given detailed written instructions to Craterus some time before his death.&lt;ref name=DSXVIII4/&gt; Craterus started to carry out Alexander's commands, but the successors chose not to further implement them, on the grounds they were impractical and extravagant.&lt;ref name=DSXVIII4/&gt; Nevertheless, Perdiccas read Alexander's will to his troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 199&quot;/&gt;

The testament called for military expansion into the southern and western Mediterranean, monumental constructions, and the intermixing of Eastern and Western populations. It included:
* Construction of a monumental tomb for his father Philip, &quot;to match the greatest of the [[Egyptian pyramids|pyramids of Egypt]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 199&quot;/&gt;
* Erection of great temples in [[Delos]], [[Delphi]], [[Dodona]], [[Dium]], [[Amphipolis]], and a monumental temple to [[Athena]] at [[Troy]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 199&quot;/&gt;
* Conquest of Arabia and the entire Mediterranean Basin&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 199&quot;/&gt;
* Circumnavigation of Africa&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 199&quot;/&gt;
* Development of cities and the &quot;transplant of populations from Asia to Europe and in the opposite direction from Europe to Asia, in order to bring the largest continent to common unity and to friendship by means of intermarriage and family ties.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McKechnie|1989|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first battle in Asia, at Granicus, Alexander used only a small part of his forces{{citation needed|reason=Plutarch and Polybios, citing earlier writers, give the strength as ranging from 30k foot and 4k horse to 43k foot and 5,500 horse|date=March 2014}}, perhaps 13,000 infantry with 5,000 cavalry, against a much larger Persian force of 40,000. Alexander placed the phalanx at the center and cavalry and archers on the wings, so that his line matched the length of the Persian cavalry line, about {{convert|3|km|2|abbr=on}}. By contrast, the Persian infantry was stationed behind its cavalry. This ensured that Alexander would not be outflanked, while his phalanx, armed with long pikes, had a considerable advantage over the Persian's [[scimitars]] and [[javelins]]. Macedonian losses were negligible compared to those of the Persians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morkot 1996 122&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Morkot|1996|p= 122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Issus in 333&amp;nbsp;BC, his first confrontation with Darius, he used the same deployment, and again the central phalanx pushed through.&lt;ref name= &quot;Morkot 1996 122&quot;/&gt; Alexander personally led the charge in the center, routing the opposing army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 193&quot;/&gt; At the decisive encounter with Darius at Gaugamela, Darius equipped his chariots with scythes on the wheels to break up the phalanx and equipped his cavalry with pikes. Alexander arranged a double phalanx, with the center advancing at an angle, parting when the chariots bore down and then reforming. The advance was successful and broke Darius' center, causing the latter to flee once again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morkot 1996 122&quot; /&gt;

When faced with opponents who used unfamiliar fighting techniques, such as in Central Asia and India, Alexander adapted his forces to his opponents' style. Thus, in [[Bactria]] and [[Sogdiana]], Alexander successfully used his javelin throwers and archers to prevent outflanking movements, while massing his cavalry at the center.&lt;ref name = &quot;Roisman 2010 193&quot;/&gt; In India, confronted by Porus' elephant corps, the Macedonians opened their ranks to envelop the elephants and used their sarissas to strike upwards and dislodge the elephants' handlers.&lt;ref name = &quot;Roisman 2010 194&quot; /&gt;

===Physical appearance===
[[File:AlexandreLouvre.jpg|thumb|upright|Roman copy of a [[herma]] by [[Lysippos]], [[Louvre Museum]]. Plutarch reports that sculptures by Lysippos were the most faithful.]]
Greek biographer [[Plutarch]] (c. 45–120 AD) describes Alexander's appearance as:
{{quote | ¹ The outward appearance of Alexander is best represented by the statues of him which Lysippus made, and it was by this artist alone that Alexander himself thought it fit that he should be modelled. ² For those peculiarities which many of his successors and friends afterwards tried to imitate, namely, the poise of the neck, which was bent slightly to the left, and the melting glance of his eyes, this artist has accurately observed. ³ Apelles, however, in painting him as wielder of the thunder-bolt, did not reproduce his complexion, but made it too dark and swarthy. Whereas he was of a fair colour, as they say, and his fairness passed into ruddiness on his breast particularly, and in his face. &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Moreover, that a very pleasant odour exhaled from his skin and that there was a fragrance about his mouth and all his flesh, so that his garments were filled with it, this we have read in the ''Memoirs of Aristoxenus''.{{Sfn |Plutarch|1919|loc = [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0243:chapter=4&amp;highlight=lysippus IV, 1]}}}}

Greek historian [[Arrian]] (Lucius Flavius Arrianus 'Xenophon' c. 86–160) described Alexander as:
{{quote | [T]he strong, handsome commander with one eye dark as the night and one blue as the sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://free-history-dictionary-books-hotels-health-maps.mithec.com/eng/alexander_the_great.html | work = Mithec | title = Alexander the Great}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bpatc.org.bd/elibrary/files/1271169473ALEXANDERTHEGREAT.pdf |title=Alexander the Great | first = John J | last = Popovic}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The semi-legendary ''[[Alexander Romance]]'' also suggests that Alexander suffered from [[heterochromia iridum]]: that one eye was dark and the other light.{{Sfn |Grafton|2010|p= 27}}

British historian [[Peter Green (historian)|Peter Green]] provided a description of Alexander's appearance, based on his review of statues and some ancient documents:
{{quote | Physically, Alexander was not prepossessing. Even by Macedonian standards he was very short, though stocky and tough. His beard was scanty, and he stood out against his hirsute Macedonian barons by going clean-shaven. His neck was in some way twisted, so that he appeared to be gazing upward at an angle. His eyes (one blue, one brown) revealed a dewy, feminine quality. He had a high complexion and a harsh voice.&lt;ref name = g15 /&gt;}}

Ancient authors recorded that Alexander was so pleased with portraits of himself created by [[Lysippos]] that he forbade other sculptors from crafting his image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Images of Authority II: The Greek Example | year= 2005 | publisher = SUNY Oneonta | url = http://employees.oneonta.edu/farberas/arth/arth200/politics/images_authority_2_greek.html | accessdate = 16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lysippos]] had often used the [[Contrapposto]] sculptural scheme to portray Alexander and other characters such as [[Apoxyomenos]], [[Hermes]] and [[Eros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Grout | first = James | title = Lysippus: Apoxyomenos | work = Encyclopaedia Romana | url = http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/miscellanea/museums/apoxyomenos.html | accessdate = 16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lysippos' sculpture, famous for its naturalism, as opposed to a stiffer, more static pose, is thought to be the most faithful depiction.{{Sfn |Bosworth|1988|pp = 19–20}}

===Personality===
[[File:Pella Lion Hunt Mosaic.jpg|thumb|left|Alexander (left) fighting an [[Asiatic lion]] with his friend [[Craterus]] (detail). 3rd century BC [[mosaic]], [[Pella]] Museum.]]
Some of Alexander's strongest personality traits formed in response to his parents.&lt;ref name=g15/&gt; His mother had huge ambitions, and encouraged him to believe it was his destiny to conquer the Persian Empire.&lt;ref name=g15/&gt; Olympias' influence instilled a sense of destiny in him,&lt;ref name=g4/&gt; and Plutarch tells us that his ambition &quot;kept his spirit serious and lofty in advance of his years.&quot;&lt;ref name=PA4/&gt; However, his father Philip was Alexander's most immediate and influential role model, as the young Alexander watched him campaign practically every year, winning victory after victory while ignoring severe wounds.&lt;ref name= &quot;Roisman 2010 190&quot; /&gt; Alexander's relationship with his father forged the competitive side of his personality; he had a need to out-do his father, illustrated by his reckless behavior in battle.&lt;ref name=g15/&gt; While Alexander worried that his father would leave him &quot;no great or brilliant achievement to be displayed to the world&quot;,&lt;ref name = PA5 /&gt; he also downplayed his father's achievements to his companions.&lt;ref name=g15 /&gt;

According to Plutarch, among Alexander's traits were a violent temper and rash, impulsive nature,&lt;ref name = AVII29 /&gt; which undoubtedly contributed to some of his decisions.&lt;ref name=g15/&gt; Although Alexander was stubborn and did not respond well to orders from his father, he was open to reasoned debate.&lt;ref name= PA7 /&gt; He had a calmer side—perceptive, logical, and calculating. He had a great desire for knowledge, a love for philosophy, and was an avid reader.&lt;ref name=PA8/&gt; This was no doubt in part due to Aristotle's tutelage; Alexander was intelligent and quick to learn.&lt;ref name=g15/&gt; His intelligent and rational side was amply demonstrated by his ability and success as a general.&lt;ref name=AVII29/&gt; He had great self-restraint in &quot;pleasures of the body,&quot; in contrast with his lack of [[self control]] with alcohol.&lt;ref name= AVII28&gt;{{harvnb | Arrian|1976|loc=VII, 28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander was erudite and patronized both arts and sciences.&lt;ref name=PA4/&gt;&lt;ref name=PA8/&gt; However, he had little interest in sports or the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic games]] (unlike his father), seeking only the [[Homeric]] ideals of honor (''timê'') and glory (''kudos'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 190&quot;&gt;{{harvnb | Roisman | Worthington |2010| p = 190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= g4 /&gt; He had great [[charisma]] and force of personality, characteristics which made him a great leader.&lt;ref name=g24/&gt;&lt;ref name=AVII29/&gt; His unique abilities were further demonstrated by the inability of any of his generals to unite Macedonia and retain the Empire after his death&amp;nbsp;– only Alexander had the ability to do so.&lt;ref name=g24 /&gt;

During his final years, and especially after the death of Hephaestion, Alexander began to exhibit signs of [[megalomania]] and [[paranoia]].&lt;ref name= g23/&gt; His extraordinary achievements, coupled with his own ineffable sense of destiny and the flattery of his companions, may have combined to produce this effect.&lt;ref name =g20/&gt; His [[delusions of grandeur]] are readily visible in his [[#Testament|testament]] and in his desire to conquer the world.&lt;ref name=g23 /&gt;

He appears to have believed himself a deity, or at least sought to deify himself.&lt;ref name=g23/&gt; Olympias always insisted to him that he was the son of Zeus,&lt;ref name= PA3 /&gt; a theory apparently confirmed to him by the oracle of Amun at [[Siwa Oasis|Siwa]].&lt;ref name=P27/&gt; He began to identify himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon.&lt;ref name=P27/&gt; Alexander adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court, notably ''[[proskynesis]]'', a practice of which Macedonians disapproved, and were loath to perform.&lt;ref name=AVII11 /&gt; This behavior cost him the sympathies of many of his countrymen.&lt;ref name= PA45 /&gt; However, Alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples, many of whom lived in kingdoms where the king was divine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morkot 1996 111&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Roisman 2010 195&quot;&gt;{{harvnb | Roisman | Worthington|2010|p=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, rather than megalomania, his behavior may simply have been a practical attempt at strengthening his rule and keeping his empire together.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morkot 1996 121&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;Roisman 2010 195&quot; /&gt;

===Personal relationships===
{{Main |Personal relationships of Alexander the Great}}
[[File:Mosaica.jpg|thumb|A mural in Pompeii, depicting the marriage of Alexander to Barsine (Stateira) in 324 BC. The couple are apparently dressed as Ares and Aphrodite.]]
Alexander married twice: [[Roxana]], daughter of the [[Bactria]]n nobleman [[Oxyartes]], out of love;{{Sfn | Plutarch |1919|loc= [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0243%3Achapter%3D47 LXVII, 1]}} and [[Stateira II]], a Persian princess and daughter of [[Darius III]] of Persia, for political reasons.{{Sfn |Plutarch|1936|loc= [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Fortuna_Alexandri*/2.html II, 6]}} He apparently had two sons, Alexander IV of Macedon of Roxana and, possibly, [[Heracles of Macedon]] from his mistress Barsine. He lost another child when Roxana miscarried at Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander01/alexander_iv.html|title=Alexander IV | publisher = Livius |accessdate=13 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn |Renault|2001|p= 100}}

Alexander also had a close relationship with his friend, general, and bodyguard [[Hephaestion]], the son of a Macedonian noble.&lt;ref name=AVII14/&gt;&lt;ref name=g15/&gt;&lt;ref name=DSXVII114/&gt; Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander.&lt;ref name=AVII14/&gt;&lt;ref name=P72/&gt; This event may have contributed to Alexander's failing health and detached [[mental health|mental state]] during his final months.&lt;ref name=g23/&gt;&lt;ref name=AMD /&gt;

Alexander's sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy.{{Sfn |Ogden|2009|p= 204}} No ancient sources stated that Alexander had [[homosexual]] relationships, or that Alexander's relationship with Hephaestion was sexual. Aelian, however, writes of Alexander's visit to [[Troy]] where &quot;Alexander garlanded the tomb of Achilles and Hephaestion that of [[Patroclus]], the latter riddling that he was a beloved of Alexander, in just the same way as Patroclus was of Achilles&quot;.&lt;ref name=AelXII7/&gt; Noting that the word ''[[eromenos]]'' (ancient Greek for beloved) does not necessarily bear sexual meaning, Alexander may have been bisexual, which in his time was not controversial.{{Sfn |Sacks|1995|p= 16}}

Green argues that there is little evidence in ancient sources that Alexander had much carnal interest in women; he did not produce an heir until the very end of his life.&lt;ref name= g15/&gt; However, he was relatively young when he died, and Ogden suggests that Alexander's matrimonial record is more impressive than his father's at the same age.{{Sfn |Ogden|2009|p= 208 | ps =: &quot;...three attested pregnancies in eight years produces an attested impregnation rate of one every 2.7 years, which is actually superior to that of his father's.&quot;}} Apart from wives, Alexander had many more female companions. Alexander accumulated a harem in the style of Persian kings, but he used it rather sparingly;&lt;ref name= DSXVII77/&gt; showing great self-control in &quot;pleasures of the body&quot;.&lt;ref name = AVII28 /&gt; Nevertheless, Plutarch described how Alexander was infatuated by Roxana while complimenting him on not forcing himself on her.{{Sfn | Plutarch| 1936| loc = [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Fortuna_Alexandri*/2.html I, 11]}} Green suggested that, in the context of the period, Alexander formed quite strong friendships with women, including [[Ada of Caria]], who adopted him, and even Darius's mother [[Sisygambis]], who supposedly died from grief upon hearing of Alexander's death.&lt;ref name = g15 /&gt;

==Legacy==

Alexander's legacy extended beyond his military conquests. His campaigns greatly increased contacts and trade between East and West, and vast areas to the east were significantly exposed to Greek civilization and influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 186&quot;/&gt; Some of the cities he founded became major cultural centers, many surviving into the 21st century. His chroniclers recorded valuable information about the areas through which he marched, while the Greeks themselves got a sense of belonging to a world beyond the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 186&quot;/&gt;

===Hellenistic kingdoms===
{{Main|Hellenistic period}}
Alexander's most immediate legacy was the introduction of Macedonian rule to huge new swathes of Asia. At the time of his death, Alexander's empire covered some {{convert|5200000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=uconn&gt;Peter Turchin, Thomas D. Hall and Jonathan M. Adams, &quot;[http://jwsr.ucr.edu/archive/vol12/number2/pdf/jwsr-v12n2-tah.pdf East-West Orientation of Historical Empires]&quot;, ''Journal of World-Systems Research'' Vol. 12 (no. 2), pp. 219–229 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and was the largest state of its time. Many of these areas remained in Macedonian hands or under Greek influence for the next 200–300&amp;nbsp;years. The [[Hellenistic period#The successors|successor states]] that emerged were, at least initially, dominant forces, and these 300&amp;nbsp;years are often referred to as the [[Hellenistic period]].&lt;ref name=gxii/&gt;

[[File:Plan of Alexandria c 30 BC Otto Puchstein 1890s EN.svg|thumb|Plan of Alexandria c. 30 BC]]
The eastern borders of Alexander's empire began to collapse even during his lifetime.&lt;ref name=g24/&gt; However, the power vacuum he left in the northwest of the Indian subcontinent directly gave rise to one of the most powerful Indian dynasties in history. Taking advantage of this, [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (referred to in Greek sources as &quot;Sandrokottos&quot;), of relatively humble origin, took control of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], and with that power base proceeded to conquer the [[Nanda Empire]].&lt;ref name=keay82/&gt;

===Founding of cities===
Over the course of his conquests, Alexander founded some [[Alexandria (disambiguation)|twenty cities that bore his name]], most of them east of the [[Tigris]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Morkot 1996 111&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Morkot|1996|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;livius&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexander/alexander_z2.html|title=Alexander the Great: his towns|publisher=livius.org|accessdate=13 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first, and greatest, was [[Alexandria]] in Egypt, which would become one of the leading Mediterranean cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morkot 1996 111&quot;/&gt; The cities' locations reflected trade routes as well as defensive positions. At first, the cities must have been inhospitable, little more than defensive garrisons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morkot 1996 111&quot;/&gt; Following Alexander's death, many Greeks who had settled there tried to return to Greece.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morkot 1996 111&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;livius&quot; /&gt; However, a century or so after Alexander's death, many of the Alexandrias were thriving, with elaborate public buildings and substantial populations that included both Greek and local peoples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morkot 1996 111&quot;/&gt;

===Hellenization===
{{Main|Hellenistic civilization}}
[[File:Alexander-Empire 323bc.jpg|thumb|Alexander's empire was the largest state of its time, covering approximately 5.2&amp;nbsp;million square km.]]

''Hellenization'' was coined by the German historian [[Johann Gustav Droysen]] to denote the spread of Greek language, culture, and population into the former Persian empire after Alexander's conquest.&lt;ref name=gxii/&gt; That this export took place is undoubted, and can be seen in the great Hellenistic cities of, for instance, [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]]&lt;ref name=g56/&gt; and [[Seleucia]] (south of modern [[Baghdad]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 =Waterman | first1 = Leroy | last2 = McDowell | first2 = Robert H. | last3 = Hopkins | first3 = Clark | title = Seleucia on the Tigris, Iraq | publisher = The Kelsey Online |year = 1998 | url= http://www.umich.edu/~kelseydb/Excavation/Seleucia.html|work=umich.edu| accessdate = 16 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander sought to insert Greek elements into [[Culture of Iran|Persian culture]] and attempted to hybridize Greek and Persian culture. This culminated in his aspiration to homogenize the populations of Asia and Europe. However, his successors explicitly rejected such policies. Nevertheless, Hellenization occurred throughout the region, accompanied by a distinct and opposite 'Orientalization' of the Successor states.&lt;ref name=g56/&gt;&lt;ref name=g21/&gt;

The core of Hellenistic culture was essentially [[Athenian]].&lt;ref name=g56/&gt;&lt;ref name=murphy/&gt; The close association of men from across Greece in Alexander's army directly led to the emergence of the largely [[Attic]]-based &quot;[[koine]]&quot;, or &quot;common&quot; Greek dialect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrison&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Harrison|1971|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Koine spread throughout the Hellenistic world, becoming the [[lingua franca]] of Hellenistic lands and eventually the ancestor of [[modern Greek]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrison&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, [[Urban planning|town planning]], education, local government, and art current in the Hellenistic period were all based on Classical Greek ideals, evolving into distinct new forms commonly grouped as Hellenistic.&lt;ref name=g56/&gt; Aspects of Hellenistic culture were still evident in the traditions of the Byzantine Empire in the mid-15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gabriel|2002|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baynes|2007|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|thumb|The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], in [[Greco-Buddhist art|Greco-Buddhist style]], 1st–2nd century AD, [[Gandhara]], ancient India. [[Tokyo National Museum]].]]
Some of the most unusual effects of Hellenization can be seen in Afghanistan and India, in the region of the relatively late-arising [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]] (250 BC-125 BC) in modern [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Tajikistan]] and the [[Indo-Greeks|Greco-Indian Kingdom]] (180 BC - 10 CE) in modern Afghanistan and India.&lt;ref name=k101/&gt; There on the newly formed [[Silk Road]] Greek culture apparently hybridized with Indian, and especially [[Buddhist]] culture. The resulting [[syncretism]] known as [[Greco-Buddhism]] heavily influenced the development of Buddhism and created a culture of [[Greco-Buddhist art]]. These Greco-Buddhist kingdoms sent some of the first Buddhist missionaries to [[China]], [[Sri Lanka]], and the Mediterranean ([[Greco-Buddhist monasticism]]). The first figural portrayals of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], previously avoided by Buddhists, appeared at this time; they were modeled on Greek statues of [[Apollo]].&lt;ref name=k101/&gt; Several Buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the [[ancient Greek religion]]: the concept of [[Boddhisatvas]] is reminiscent of Greek divine heroes,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Luniya|1978|p=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some [[Mahayana]] [[Offering (Buddhism)|ceremonial practices]] (burning [[incense]], gifts of flowers, and food placed on altars) are similar to those practiced by the ancient Greeks. One Greek king, [[Menander I]], probably became Buddhist, and was immortalized in [[Buddhist texts|Buddhist literature]] as 'Milinda'.&lt;ref name=k101/&gt; The process of Hellenization extended to the sciences, where ideas from [[Greek astronomy]] filtered eastward and had profoundly influenced [[Indian astronomy]] by the early centuries AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pingree (1978), 533, 554f.&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pingree|1978|pp=533, 554f}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Greek astronomical instruments dating to the 3rd century BC were found in the [[Greco-Bactrian]] city of [[Ai Khanoum]] in modern-day [[Afghanistan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cambon|Jarrige|2006|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Greek concept of a [[spherical earth]] surrounded by the spheres of planets was adopted in India and eventually supplanted the long-standing Indian cosmological belief of a flat and circular earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pingree (1978), 533, 554f.&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glick|Livesey|Wallis|2005|p=463}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yavanajataka]] and [[Paulisa Siddhanta]] texts in particular show Greek influence.

===Influence on Rome===
[[File:Roman - Medallion with Alexander the Great - Walters 591 - Obverse.jpg|thumb|This medallion was produced in [[Imperial Rome]], demonstrating the influence of Alexander's memory. [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].]]
Alexander and his exploits were admired by many Romans, especially generals, who wanted to associate themselves with his achievements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asirvatham&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|loc=Chapter 6, p. 114}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polybius]] began his ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]'' by reminding Romans of Alexander's achievements, and thereafter Roman leaders saw him as a role model. [[Pompey the Great]] adopted the epithet &quot;Magnus&quot; and even Alexander's anastole-type haircut, and searched the conquered lands of the east for Alexander's 260-year-old cloak, which he then wore as a sign of greatness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asirvatham&quot;/&gt; [[Julius Caesar]] dedicated a [[Lysippus|Lysippean]] [[equestrian statue|equestrian]] [[bronze]] statue but replaced Alexander's head with his own, while [[Octavian]] visited Alexander's tomb in Alexandria and temporarily changed his seal from a [[sphinx]] to Alexander's profile.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asirvatham&quot;/&gt; The emperor [[Trajan]] also admired Alexander, as did [[Nero]] and [[Caracalla]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Asirvatham&quot;/&gt; The Macriani, a Roman family that in the person of [[Macrinus]] briefly ascended to the imperial throne, kept images of Alexander on their persons, either on jewelry, or embroidered into their clothes.&lt;ref name=Holt3/&gt;
[[File:Demetrius I of Bactria.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Greco-Bactrian]] king [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius]] (reigned c. 200–180&amp;nbsp;BC), wearing an elephant scalp, took over Alexander's legacy in the east by again invading [[India]], and establishing the [[Indo-Greek kingdom]] (180&amp;nbsp;BC–10&amp;nbsp;AD).]]
On the other hand, some Roman writers, particularly Republican figures, used Alexander as a cautionary tale of how [[autocratic]] tendencies can be kept in check by [[Roman republic|republican]] values.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asirvatham2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|loc=Chapter 6, p. 115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander was used by these writers as an example of ruler values such as ''amicita'' (friendship) and ''clementia'' (clemency), but also ''iracundia'' (anger) and ''cupiditas gloriae'' (over-desire for glory).&lt;ref name=&quot;Asirvatham2&quot;/&gt;

===Legend===
{{Main|Alexander the Great in legend}}
Legendary accounts surround the life of Alexander the Great, many deriving from his own lifetime, probably encouraged by Alexander himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 187&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; His court historian Callisthenes portrayed the sea in [[Cilicia]] as drawing back from him in proskynesis. Writing shortly after Alexander's death, another participant, [[Onesicritus]], invented a [[Courtship|tryst]] between Alexander and [[Thalestris]], queen of the mythical [[Amazons]]. When Onesicritus read this passage to his patron, Alexander's general and later King [[Lysimachus]] reportedly quipped, &quot;I wonder where I was at the time.&quot;&lt;ref name=PA46/&gt;

In the first centuries after Alexander's death, probably in Alexandria, a quantity of the legendary material coalesced into a text known as the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'', later falsely ascribed to Callisthenes and therefore known as ''Pseudo-Callisthenes''. This text underwent numerous expansions and revisions throughout Antiquity and the [[Middle Ages]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stoneman|1996|loc=''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing many dubious stories,&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 187&quot;/&gt; and was translated into numerous languages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 117&quot;/&gt;

===In ancient and modern culture===
{{Main|Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great|Alexander the Great in the Quran}}

[[File:Byzantine Greek Alexander Manuscript Cataphract (cropped).JPG|thumb|Alexander the Great depicted in a 14th-century Byzantine manuscript]]

Alexander the Great's accomplishments and legacy have been depicted in many cultures. Alexander has figured in both high and popular culture beginning in his own era to the present day. The ''Alexander Romance'', in particular, has had a significant impact on portrayals of Alexander in later cultures, from Persian to medieval European to modern Greek.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 117&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|loc=Chapter 6, 117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander features prominently in modern Greek folklore, more so than any other ancient figure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fermor&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fermor|2006|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colloquial form of his name in modern Greek (&quot;O Megalexandros&quot;) is a household name, and he is the only ancient hero to appear in the [[Karagiozis]] shadow play.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fermor&quot; /&gt; One well-known fable among Greek seamen involves a solitary [[mermaid]] who would grasp a ship's prow during a storm and ask the captain &quot;Is King Alexander alive?&quot;. The correct answer is &quot;He is alive and well and rules the world!&quot;, causing the mermaid to vanish and the sea to calm. Any other answer would cause the mermaid to turn into a raging [[Gorgon]] who would drag the ship to the bottom of the sea, all hands aboard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fermor&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Al-khidr.jpg|thumb|right|Post-Islamic [[Persian miniature]] depicting [[Khidr]] and Alexander watching the Water of Life revive a salted fish]]

[[St. Augustine]], in his book ''[[City of God (book)|City of God]]'', restated Cicero's parable showing that Alexander the Great was little more than a leader of a robber band:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And so if justice is left out, what are kingdoms except great robber bands? For what are robber bands except little kingdoms? The band also is a group of men governed by the orders of a leader, bound by a social compact, and its booty is divided according to a law agreed upon. If by repeatedly adding desperate men this plague grows to the point where it holds territory and establishes a fixed seat, seizes cities and subdues people, then it more conspicuously assumes the name of kingdom, and this name is now openly granted to it, not for any subtraction of cupidity, but by addition of impunity. For it was an elegant and true reply that was made to Alexander the Great by a certain pirate whom he had captured. When the king asked him what he was thinking of, that he should molest the sea, he said with defiant independence: 'The same as you when you molest the world! Since I do this with a little ship I am called a pirate. You do it with a great fleet and are called emperor'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothbard|first=Murray|title=An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought|publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute|isbn=9781610164771|page=35|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MCcWhLmRo-cC&amp;pg=PA35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In pre-Islamic [[Middle Persian language|Middle Persian]] ([[Zoroastrian]]) literature, Alexander is referred to by the epithet ''gujastak'', meaning &quot;accursed&quot;, and is accused of destroying temples and burning the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Curtis|Tallis|Andre-Salvini|2005|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Islamic Iran, under the influence of the ''[[Alexander Romance]]'' (in {{lang-fa|اسکندرنامه}} ''[[Iskandarnamah]]''), a more positive portrayal of Alexander emerges.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 120&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|loc=Chapter 6, 120}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Firdausi|Firdausi's]] ''[[Shahnameh]]'' (&quot;The Book of Kings&quot;) includes Alexander in a line of legitimate Iranian [[shah]]s, a mythical figure who explored the far reaches of the world in search of the [[Fountain of Youth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fischer|2004|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Persian writers associate him with philosophy, portraying him at a symposium with figures such as [[Socrates]], [[Plato]] and Aristotle, in search of immortality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 120&quot; /&gt;

The [[Syriac]] version of the ''Alexander Romance'' portrays him as an ideal Christian world conqueror who prayed to &quot;the one true God&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 120&quot; /&gt; In Egypt, Alexander was portrayed as the son of [[Nectanebo II]], the last [[pharaoh]] before the Persian conquest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 122&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Roisman|Worthington|2010|loc=Chapter 6, 122}}&lt;/ref&gt; His defeat of Darius was depicted as Egypt's salvation, &quot;proving&quot; Egypt was still ruled by an Egyptian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 122&quot; /&gt;

The figure of [[Dhul-Qarnayn]] (literally &quot;the Two-Horned One&quot;) mentioned in the [[Quran]] is believed by some scholars to represent Alexander, due to parallels with the ''Alexander Romance''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 120&quot; /&gt; In this tradition, he was a heroic figure who built a wall to defend against the nations of [[Gog and Magog]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 122&quot; /&gt; He then traveled the known world in search for the Water of Life and Immortality, eventually becoming a prophet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 122&quot; /&gt;

In [[Hindi]] and [[Urdu]], the name &quot;Sikandar&quot;, derived from Persian, denotes a rising young talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Connerney|2009|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] he was made a member of the [[Nine Worthies]], a group of heroes who encapsulated all the ideal qualities of [[chivalry]].

==Historiography==
{{Main|Alexander the Great in historiography}}
Apart from a few inscriptions and fragments, texts written by people who actually knew Alexander or who gathered information from men who served with Alexander were all lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 186&quot;/&gt; Contemporaries who wrote accounts of his life included Alexander's campaign historian Callisthenes; Alexander's generals Ptolemy and [[Nearchus]]; [[Aristobulus of Cassandreia|Aristobulus]], a junior officer on the campaigns; and Onesicritus, Alexander's chief helmsman. Their works are lost, but later works based on these [[primary source|original sources]] have survived. The earliest of these is [[Diodorus Siculus]] (1st century BC), followed by Quintus Curtius Rufus (mid-to-late 1st century AD), Arrian (1st to 2nd century AD), the biographer Plutarch (1st to 2nd century AD), and finally [[Justin (historian)|Justin]], whose work dated as late as the 4th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 186&quot;/&gt; Of these, Arrian is generally considered the most reliable, given that he used Ptolemy and Aristobulus as his sources, closely followed by Diodorus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roisman 2010 186&quot;/&gt;
