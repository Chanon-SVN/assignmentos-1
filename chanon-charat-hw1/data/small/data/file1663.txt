&quot;'''{{lang|de|''Arbeit macht frei''}}'''&quot; ({{IPA-de|ˈaɐ̯baɪt ˈmaxt ˈfʁaɪ}}) is a German phrase meaning &quot;work makes (you) free&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopedia of the Holocaust]]'', [[Yad Vashem]],  1990, vol. 4, p. 1751.&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan is known for having been placed over the entrances to a number of [[Nazi concentration camps]] during [[World War II]], including most infamously [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz I]], where it was made by prisoners with metalwork skills and erected by order of the Nazis in June 1940.

==Etymology==

The expression comes from the title of a novel by German [[Philology|philologist]] [[Lorenz Diefenbach]], ''Arbeit macht frei: Erzählung von Lorenz Diefenbach'' (1873), in which gamblers and fraudsters find the path to virtue through labour.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news |last=Connolly |first=Kate |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/dec/18/auschwitz-arbeit-macht-frei-sign |title=Poland declares state of emergency after 'Arbeit Macht Frei' stolen from Auschwitz |publisher=The Guardian |date=18 December 2009}}
*Diefenbach, Lorenz. ''Arbeit macht frei: Erzählung von Lorenz Diefenbach''. J. Kühtmann's Buchhandlung, 1873.&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was also used in French (&quot;le travail rend libre!&quot;)  by [[Auguste Forel]], a Swiss ant scientist, neuroanatomist and psychiatrist, in his &quot;Fourmis de la Suisse&quot; [&quot;Ants of Switzerland&quot;] (1920).&lt;ref name=&quot;Fourmis de la Suisse&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archive.org/stream/lesfourmisdelasu00fore#page/n7/mode/2up |title=Les fourmis de la Suisse (2nd Ed.) |first=Auguste |last=Forel |authorlink=Auguste Forel|location=La Chaux-de-Fonds |publisher=Imprimarie cooperative |year=1920 |language=French |accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, the Deutsche Schulverein of Vienna, an ethnic nationalist &quot;protective&quot; organization of Germans within the Austrian empire, printed membership stamps with the phrase ''Arbeit macht frei''. It was adopted in 1928 by the [[Weimar Republic|Weimar government]] as a slogan extolling the effects of their desired policy of large-scale [[public works]] programmes to end unemployment. This use of the phrase was continued by the [[Nazi Party]] when it came to power in 1933.

The slogan &quot;''Arbeit macht frei''&quot; was placed at the entrances to a number of [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]]s. The slogan's use in this instance was ordered by [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] General [[Theodor Eicke]], inspector of concentration camps and second commandant of [[Dachau Concentration Camp]].

The slogan can still be seen at several sites, including over the entrance to [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz I]] where, according to BBC historian [[Laurence Rees]] in his &quot;Auschwitz: a New History&quot;, the sign was erected by order of commandant [[Rudolf Höss]]. This particular sign was made by prisoner-labourers including [[Jan Liwacz]].

In 1933 the first political prisoners were being rounded up for an indefinite period without charges. They were held in a number of places in Germany. The slogan was first used over the gate of a &quot;wild camp&quot; in the city of [[Oranienburg concentration camp|Oranienburg]], which was set up in an abandoned brewery in March 1933 (it was later rebuilt in 1936 as [[Sachsenhausen (detention camp)|Sachsenhausen]]{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}). It can also be seen at the [[Dachau concentration camp]], [[Gross-Rosen concentration camp]], and the [[Concentration camp Theresienstadt|Theresienstadt]] Ghetto-Camp, as well as at [[Fort Breendonk]] in [[Belgium]]. It has been claimed that the slogan was placed over entrance gates to Auschwitz III / Buna/Monowitz.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Avey with Rob Broomby ''The Man who Broke into Auschwitz'', Hodder and Stoughton, London, 2011 p.236&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freddie Knoller with Robert Landaw ''Desperate Journey'', Metro, London, 2002, p.158&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan appeared at the [[Flossenbürg concentration camp|Flossenbürg]] camp on the left gate post at the camp entry. The original gate posts survive in another part of the camp, but the slogan sign no longer exists.&lt;ref&gt;KZ-Gedenkstaette Flossenbuerg&lt;/ref&gt; [[Primo Levi]] describes seeing the words illuminated over a doorway (as distinct from a gate) in [[Monowitz concentration camp|Auschwitz III/Buna Monowitz]].&lt;ref&gt;Primo Levi, trans. Stuart Woolf, ''If This is a Man'' Abacus, London, 2004, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Buchenwald concentration camp|Buchenwald]], &quot;[[Jedem das Seine]]&quot; (literally, &quot;to each his own&quot;, but idiomatically &quot;everyone gets what he deserves&quot;) was used.

In 1938 the [[Austria]]n political [[cabaret]] writer [[Jura Soyfer]] and the [[composer]] [[Herbert Zipper]], while prisoners at [[Dachau Concentration Camp]], wrote the ''[[Dachaulied]]'' (The Dachau Song). They had spent weeks marching in and out of the camp's gate to daily [[forced labour]], and considered the motto &quot;''Arbeit macht frei''&quot; over the gate an insult. The song repeats the phrase cynically as a &quot;lesson&quot; taught by Dachau.  (The first verse is translated in the article on [[Jura Soyfer]].)

In ''The Kingdom of Auschwitz'', [[Otto Friedrich]] wrote regarding Höss:
:He seems not to have intended it as a mockery, nor even to have intended it literally, as a false promise that those who worked to exhaustion would eventually be released, but rather as a kind of mystical declaration that self-sacrifice in the form of endless labour does in itself bring a kind of spiritual freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Friedrich |first= Otto |title= The Kingdom of Auschwitz |publisher= [[Harper Perennial]] |date=August 1994 |isbn= 978-0-06-097640-8 |pages= 2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sign over Auschwitz was stolen in December 2009 by thieves, and later recovered by authorities in three pieces. Anders Högström, a Swedish former neo-Nazi leader, and two Poles were jailed for the act. As a result, the original is now in the [[Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum]], and a replica has been placed over the gate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12094855 | work=BBC News | title=Auschwitz sign theft: Swedish man jailed | date=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sign in the Dachau gate was stolen in November 2014 by unknown thieves. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29878278 | work=BBC | title=Dachau infamous Nazi concentration camp gate stolen | date=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
