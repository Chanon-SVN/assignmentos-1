The '''Atari Lynx''' is a 16-bit [[handheld game console]] that was released by [[Atari Corporation]] in September 1989. The Lynx holds the distinction of being the world's first [[handheld electronic game]] with a [[color]] [[LCD]]. The system is also notable for its forward-looking features, advanced graphics, and [[ambidextrous]] layout. As part of the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|fourth generation of gaming]], the Lynx competed with [[Nintendo]]'s [[Game Boy]] (released just a month earlier), the [[Sega Game Gear]] and [[NEC]]'s [[TurboExpress]], both released the following year.

As with many classic consoles, there has been a modern [[retrogaming]] community, creating and selling games for the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atariage.com/company_page.html?SystemID=LYNX&amp;CompanyID=92 |title=Atari Age Self Published Lynx Games |publisher=atariage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The Atari Lynx has several innovative features including it being the first color handheld, with a backlit display, a switchable right-handed/left-handed (upside down) configuration, and the ability to network with up to 17 other units via its &quot;Comlynx&quot; system (though most games would network eight or fewer players). [[Comlynx]] was originally developed to run over infrared links (and was codenamed RedEye). This was changed to a cable-based networking system before the final release.

{{quote box | align=right | width=25% | quote=&quot;The leading-edge display was the most expensive component, so the colour choice was one of economy. If the low-cost glass and drivers would have supported a million colours, I would have done it.&quot; | source=Dave Needle, Lynx codesigner&lt;ref name=&quot;Retroinspection: Atari Lynx&quot;/&gt; }}
The Lynx was cited as the &quot;first gaming console with [[Graphics processing unit|hardware]] support for zooming and distortion of [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]]&quot;.  Featuring a 4096 color palette and integrated math and graphics co-processors (including a [[blitter]] unit), its [[pseudo-3D]] color graphics display was said to be the key defining feature in the system's competition against Nintendo's monochromatic Game Boy.  The fast pseudo-3D graphics features were made possible on a minimal hardware system by Needle having &quot;invented the technique for planar expansion/shrinking capability&quot; and using stretched, textured, triangles instead of full polygons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Retroinspection: Atari Lynx&quot;/&gt;  These particular features were achieved over a year prior to the launch of the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]], whose stock hardware features the comparable [[Mode 7]] but which can't scale sprites.

== History ==
The Lynx was the second handheld game system to be released with the Atari name. The first was Atari Inc.'s [[handheld electronic game]] ''[[Touch Me (arcade game)|Touch Me]]''. Atari Inc. had previously worked on several other handheld projects including the ''[[Breakout (arcade game)|Breakout]]'', ''[[Space Invaders]]'', and the [[Atari Cosmos]] portable/tabletop console. However, those projects were shut down during development, some just short of their intended commercial release.

The Lynx system was originally developed by [[Epyx]] as the '''Handy Game'''. In 1986, two former [[Amiga]] designers, R.J. Mical and Dave Needle, had been asked by former manager at Amiga, David Morse, if they could come up a design for a portable gaming system.&lt;ref name= &quot;EGM1989&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wired&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jacobs |first=Steven |date= |title=Third Time's a Charm (They Hope) |url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/2.01/3do_pr.html |journal=Wired |location=United States |publisher=Conde Nast |accessdate=2014-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Morse now worked at Epyx, a game software company that had a recent string of hit games. Morse's son had asked him if he could make a portable gaming system, prompting the lunch with Mical and Needle to discuss the idea. Morse convinced Mical and Needle to develop the idea and they were hired by Epyx to be a part of the design team.&lt;ref name=&quot;EGM1989&quot;/&gt; Planning and design of the console began in 1986 and was completed in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;retrogamer&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peter Latimer |date=July 2005 |title=Atari Lynx |journal=Retro Gamer |issue=4 |pages=Pages 24–31 |issn=1742-3155 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Epyx first showed the Handy system at the Winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES) in January 1989.&lt;ref name= &quot;EGM1989&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jermaine |first=John |date=1989-11 |title=Lynx, an interview with the men behind the machine |url=http://ataritimes.com/index.php?ArticleIDX=370 |journal=Electronic Gaming Monthly |location=United States |publisher=Sendai Publications |accessdate=2014-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Facing financial difficulties, Epyx sought out partners. Atari Corp. and Epyx eventually agreed that Atari Corp. would handle production and marketing, while Epyx would handle software development.

The Handy was designed to run games from the cartridge format, and the game data must be copied from ROM to RAM before it can be used, so less memory was available and the games initially load relatively slowly.&lt;ref name=&quot;retrogamer&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Peter Latimer |date=July 2005 |title=Atari Lynx |journal=Retro Gamer |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=Pages 24–31 |issn=1742-3155 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are trace remnants of a [[Compact Cassette|cassette tape]] interface physically capable of being programmed to read a tape.

Atari Corp. changed the internal speaker and removed the thumb-stick on the control pad before releasing it as the Lynx, initially retailing in the US at {{US$|179.95}}. Atari Corp. then showed the Lynx to the press at the Summer 1989 CES as the &quot;Portable Color Entertainment System&quot;, which was changed to &quot;Lynx&quot; when actual consoles were distributed to resellers.&lt;ref name=&quot;retrogamer&quot;/&gt;

The Lynx started off successful. Atari reported that they had sold 90% of the 50,000 units it shipped in its launch month in the U.S. with a limited launch in New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;NevadaDaily&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=New games make big splash |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1908&amp;dat=19900603&amp;id=yugfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lNkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2239,4378537 |newspaper=The Nevada Daily Mail |location=Vernon County, Missouri |date=June 3, 1990 |accessdate=2014-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; US sales in 1990 were approximately 500,000 units according to the [[Associated Press]]&lt;ref name=&quot;1990 sales&quot;&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1991/Sega-Woos-Game-Boy-Lynx-Users-With-32-Color-Hand-Held-Video-System/id-a1288531efff2f9504f70dbcd9f8b6cc |title=Sega Woos Game Boy, Lynx Users With 32-Color, Hand-Held Video System |accessdate=November 7, 2013 |publisher=Associated Press| date =January 4, 1991|author=Catalina Ortiz}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1991, it was reported that Atari sales estimates were about 800,000, which Atari claimed was within their expected projections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raze Magazine, issue 11&quot;&gt;{{ cite journal | url=https://archive.org/details/raze-magazine-11 | title=Raze Magazine | issue=11 | date=September 1991 | page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lifetime sales by 1995 amounted to less than 7&amp;nbsp;million units when combined with the Game Gear.&lt;ref name=seattle/&gt; In comparison, the Game Boy sold 16 million units by 1995.&lt;ref name=seattle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19950105&amp;slug=2097913 |title=Virtual Fun - Nintendo Adds A New Dimension To Games |accessdate=November 7, 2013 |publisher=Seattle Times| date =January 5, 1995|author=Steven Kent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the actual console units, the game cartridges themselves evolved over the first year of the console's release. The first generation of cartridges were flat, and were designed to be stackable for ease of storage. However, this design proved to be very difficult to remove from the console and was replaced by a second design. This style, called &quot;tabbed&quot; or &quot;ridged&quot;, used the same basic design as the original cartridges with the addition of two small tabs on the cartridge's underside to aid in removal. The original flat style cartridges could be stacked on top of the newer cartridges, but the newer cartridges could not be easily stacked on each other, nor were they stored easily. Thus a third style, the &quot;curved lip&quot; style was produced, and all official and third-party cartridges during the console's lifespan were released (or re-released) using this style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atariage.com/system_labels.html?SystemID=LYNX Atari Lynx] cartridge style illustrations at AtariAge.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1991, Sega launched its Game Gear portable gaming handheld. Also a color handheld, in comparison to the Lynx it had a higher cost and shorter battery life (3–4 hours as opposed to 4-5 for the Lynx), but it was slightly smaller and was backed up by significantly more games. In North America the Game Gear took second place, and while in Europe sales of the Lynx were initially quite strong on the back of the popular Atari ST, it still could not compete with the software library of the Game Gear and was eventually pushed into third place. Retailers such as Game and Toys R Us continued to sell the Lynx well into the mid-90s on the back of the Atari Jaguar launch, helped by magazines such as Ultimate Future Games who continued to cover the Lynx alongside the new generation of 32-bit and 64-bit consoles.

[[File:Atari-Lynx-II-Handheld-Angled.jpg|right|thumb|The Atari Lynx II, smaller and lighter than the original.]]
During 1990, the Lynx had moderate sales. In 1991, Atari Corp. introduced the Lynx II with a new marketing campaign, new packaging, slightly improved hardware, better battery life and a new sleeker look. The new system (referred to within Atari Corp. as the &quot;Lynx II&quot;) featured rubber hand grips and a clearer backlit color screen with a power save option (which turned off the LCD panel's backlighting). It also replaced the monaural headphone jack of the original Lynx with one wired for stereo. The new packaging made the Lynx available without any accessories, dropping the price to $99. Although sales improved, Nintendo still dominated the handheld market.

In 1994, Atari Corp. shifted its focus away from the Lynx. As Nintendo's [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Nintendo]] and Sega's [[Sega Genesis]] filled retailers' shelves, Atari Corp. refocused its efforts on its Jaguar console. A handful of games were released during this time, including ''Battlezone 2000''. In 1996, Atari shut down its internal game development.

Telegames released a number of games in the second half of the 1990s, including a port of ''[[Raiden (arcade game)|Raiden]]'' and a platformer called ''Fat Bobby'' in 1997, as well as an action sports game called ''Hyperdrome'' in 1999. At the end of the 1990s, Hasbro, the owners of the Atari properties at the time, released the rights to develop for the system to the public domain. Since then a number of independent developers released games into the new decade, like ''[[Championship Rally (Atari Lynx)|Championship Rally]]'', ''CyberVirus'', and ''Alpine Games''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duranik.com Alpine Games by Duranik]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the late 90s/early 2000s games were under development by other companies at one time, but rights to the game programs and all of the existing code was bought and finished by other developers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://songbird-productions.com/cybervirus.shtml Songbird Productions'] development page for CyberVirus&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Atari was honored at the 59th Annual [[Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Award]]s for pioneering the development of [[handheld games]] with its Lynx game unit.&lt;ref name=&quot;CES 08 Nintendo Emmy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6184421.html |title=CES '08: Nintendo wins second Emmy |publisher=GameSpot |date=2008-01-08 |accessdate=2014-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 24, 2009, North American company [[Super Fighter Team]] released ''[[Zaku (video game)|Zaku]]'', a horizontal shooter for the Lynx developed by PenguiNet. It was the first new game for the system since the 1990s whose game card has an authentic &quot;curved lip&quot; plastic shell instead of a custom bare circuit board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zaku-lynx.com/ Official Zaku website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The game system was reviewed in 1990 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #155 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in &quot;The Role of Computers&quot; column. The reviewers gave the Lynx 5 out of 5 stars, stating that it &quot;throws the Gameboy{{sic|?}} into the prehistoric age&quot;, and praising the built-in object scaling capabilities, the multiplayer feature of the ComLynx cable, and the strong set of launch games.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dragon155&quot;&gt;{{cite journal
