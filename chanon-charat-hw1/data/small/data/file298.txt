An '''archipelago''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-archipelago.ogg|ɑr|k|ɨ|ˈ|p|ɛ|l|ə|ɡ|oʊ}} {{respell|ark-i|PEL|ə-goh}}), sometimes called an '''island group''' or '''island chain''', is a chain, cluster or collection of [[island]]s. The word ''archipelago'' is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''ἄρχι- – arkhi-'' (&quot;chief&quot;) and ''πέλαγος – pélagos'' (&quot;sea&quot;) through the Italian ''arcipelago''. In [[Italian language|Italian]], possibly following a tradition of [[Classical Antiquity|antiquity]], the '''''Arcipelago''''' (from [[medieval Greek]] ''[[Linguistic reconstruction|*]]ἀρχιπέλαγος'') was the proper name for the [[Aegean Sea]] and, later, usage shifted to refer to the [[Aegean Islands]] (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a large number of scattered islands.

Archipelagos may be found isolated in bodies of water or neighboring a large [[land mass]]. For example, [[Scotland]] has more than 700 islands surrounding its mainland which constitute an archipelago. Archipelagos are often volcanic, forming along island arcs generated by [[subduction|subduction zones]] or [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]], but may also be the result of [[erosion]], [[Deposition (sediment)|deposition]], and [[land elevation]]. Depending on their geological origin, islands forming archipelagos can be referred to as ''oceanic islands'', ''continental fragments'', and ''continental islands''.&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker R. J. &amp; Fernández-Palacios J. M. (2007) ''Island Biogeography: Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation''. New York, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Oceanic islands are mainly of volcanic origin. Continental fragments correspond to land masses that have separated from a continental mass due to tectonic displacement. Finally, sets of islands formed close to the coast of a continent are considered continental archipelagos when they form part of the same continental shelf so islands are just exposed continental shelf. 

The five main archipelagos are [[Indonesia]], [[Japan]], the [[Philippines]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[British Isles]]. The largest archipelagic state in the world, by area and population, is Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Indonesia | publisher=Central Intelligence Agency | work=The World Factbook | date=4 December 2008 | url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/id.html | accessdate=7 December 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081210041527/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/id.html| archivedate= 10 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archipelago with the most islands is the [[Archipelago Sea]] in [[Finland]].{{citation needed|reason=Not so in: List of archipelagos by number of islands|date=June 2012}}
