The meaning of the word 'American' in the [[English language]] varies according to the historical, geographical, and political context in which it is used. ''American'' is derived from ''America'', a term originally denoting all of the [[New World]] (also called ''the [[Americas]]''). In some expressions, it retains this [[Americas|Pan-American]] sense, but its usage has evolved over time and, for various historical reasons, the word came to denote people or things specifically from the [[United States|United States of America]].

In modern English, ''[[Americans]]'' generally refers to residents of the United States; among native English speakers this usage is almost universal, with any other use of the term requiring specification.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Kenneth G.|title=The Columbia Guide to Standard American English|year=1993|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-06989-8|pages=27–28|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=L2ChiO2yEZ0C&amp;pg=PA27}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20080316032628/http://www.bartleby.com/68/37/337.html View at Bartleby]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this default use has been the source of controversy, particularly among [[Latin Americans]], who feel that using the term solely for the United States misappropriates it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mencken&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | first = H.

The word can be used as both a [[noun]] and an [[adjective]]. In adjectival use, it is generally understood to mean &quot;of or relating to the United States&quot;; for example, &quot;[[Elvis Presley]] was an American singer&quot; or &quot;the American President gave a speech today&quot;. In noun form, it generally means [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizen or national]]. The noun is rarely used in [[American English]] to refer to people not connected to the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;/&gt; When used with a [[Grammatical modifier|grammatical qualifier]], the adjective ''American'' can mean &quot;of or relating to the Americas&quot;, as in [[Latin America]]n or [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American]]. Less frequently, the adjective can take this meaning without a qualifier, as in &quot;[[Spanish dialects and varieties|American Spanish]] dialects and pronunciation differ by country&quot;, or the name of the [[Organization of American States]]. A third use of the term pertains specifically to the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]], for instance, &quot;In the 16th century, many Americans died from imported diseases during the European conquest&quot;.

In French, ''{{lang|fr|états-unien}}'', ''{{lang|fr|étas-unien}}'' or ''{{lang|fr|étasunien}}'', from ''{{lang|fr|États-Unis d'Amérique}}'' (&quot;United States of America&quot;), is a rarely used word that distinguishes U.S. things and persons from the adjective ''{{lang|fr|américain}}'', which denotes persons and things from the United States, but may also refer to &quot;the Americas&quot;.&lt;ref name=french-etatsunien /&gt; 

Likewise, German's use of ''{{lang|de|U.S.-amerikanisch}}'' and ''{{lang|de|U.S.-Amerikaner}}''&lt;ref name=de-dict /&gt; observe said cultural distinction, solely denoting U.S. things and people. Note that these are &quot;politically correct&quot; terms and that in normal parlance, the adjective &quot;American&quot; and its direct cognates are almost always used unless the context does not render the nationality of the person clear. For this reason, the [[style manual]] of the ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]'' (one of the leading German-language newspapers) dismisses the term ''{{lang|de|U.S.-amerikanisch}}'' as both ′unnecessary′ and ′artificial′ and recommends replacing it with ''amerikanisch''.&lt;ref&gt;''Vademecum.

Portuguese has ''{{lang|pt|americano}}'', denoting both a person or thing from the Americas and a U.S. national.&lt;ref name=pt-americano&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Dicionário Priberam da Língua Portuguesa|url=http://www.priberam.pt/dlpo/default.aspx?pal=americano|title=americano|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; For referring specifically to a U.S. national and things, the words used are ''{{lang|pt|estadunidense}}'' (also spelled ''{{lang|pt|estado-unidense}}'') (United States person), from ''{{lang|pt|Estados Unidos da América}}'', and ''{{lang|pt|ianque}}'' (&quot;Yankee&quot;), but the term most often used is ''{{lang|pt|norte-americano}}'', even though it could, as with its Spanish equivalent, apply to Canadians, Mexicans, etc. as well.

In Spanish, ''{{lang|sp|americano}}'' denotes geographic and cultural origin in the New World, as well as (infrequently) a U.S. citizen;&lt;ref name=rae-americano&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=[[Diccionario de la lengua española]]|title=americano|url=http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltGUIBusUsual?TIPO_HTML=2&amp;TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=americano|publisher=Real Academia Española|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Pequeño Larousse Ilustrado 1992 edition, look up word Americano: Contains the Observation: Debe evitarse el empleo de americano con el sentido de norteamericano o de los Estados Unidos|trans_title=Usage of the word with the meaning of U.S. citizen or the United States must be avoided | url = |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The first two definitions in ''[[Diccionario de la lengua española]]'' (the [[Linguistic prescription#Authority|official dictionary]] in Spanish) define ''{{lang|sp|americano}}'' as &quot;Native of America&quot; [''{{lang|sp|Natural de América}}''] and &quot;Pertaining or relating to this part of the world&quot; [''{{lang|sp|Perteneciente o relativo a esta parte del mundo}}''], where ''{{lang|sp|América}}'' refers to the continent.{{#tag:ref|{{cite encyclopedia|title=América|encyclopedia=WordReference English-Spanish Dictionary|url=http://www.wordreference.com/es/en/translation.asp?spen=Am%C3%A9rica}}}} The fourth definition of ''{{lang|sp|americano}}'' is defined as &quot;United States person&quot; [''{{lang|sp|estadounidense}}''].}} the more common term is ''{{lang|sp|[[estadounidense]]}}'' (&quot;United States person&quot;), which derives from ''{{lang|sp|Estados Unidos de América}}'' (&quot;United States of America&quot;). The Spanish term ''{{lang|sp|norteamericano}}'' (&quot;North American&quot;), is frequently used to refer things and persons from the United States, but this term can also denote people and things from Canada, Mexico, and the rest of [[North America]].&lt;ref name=rae-estadosunidos&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Diccionario panhispánico de dudas|url=http://buscon.rae.es/dpd/?key=norteamericano&amp;origen=REDPD|title=norteamericano|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other languages, however, there is no possibility for confusion. For example, the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] word for &quot;U.S. natural&quot; is ''{{transl|zh|měiguórén}}'' ({{zh|t=美國人|s=美国人}})&lt;ref name=zh-dict-us-natural&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/zhen/%E7%BE%8E%E5%9B%BD%E4%BA%BA|title=美国人|work=WordReference English-Chinese Dictionary|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|''{{transl|zh|Měiguórén}}'' is the standard [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] pronunciation.}} is derived from a word for the United States, ''{{transl|zh|měiguó}}'', where ''{{transl|zh|měi}}'' is an abbreviation for ''{{transl|zh|měizhōu}}'' (&quot;America [the continent]&quot;) and ''{{transl|zh|guó}}'' is &quot;country&quot;.&lt;ref name=zh-dict-us&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/enzh/United%20States|title=United States|work=WordReference English-Chinese Dictionary|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zh-dict-america&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/enzh/America|title=America|work=WordReference English-Chinese Dictionary|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zh-dict-country&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/enzh/country|title=country|work=WordReference English-Chinese Dictionary|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name for the American continent is ''{{transl|zh|měizhōu}}'', from ''{{transl|zh|měi}}'' plus ''{{transl|zh|zhōu}}'' (&quot;continent&quot;).&lt;ref name=zh-dict-continent&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/enzh/continent|title=continent|work=WordReference English-Chinese Dictionary|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a ''{{transl|zh|měi'''zhōu'''rén}}'' is an American in the continent sense, and a ''{{transl|zh|měi'''guó'''rén}}'' is an American in the U.S. sense.{{efn|Chinese: ''{{transl|zh|měiguó}}'' (&quot;United States&quot;) is written as {{lang|zh|美国}}, ''{{transl|zh|měizhōu}}'' (&quot;America the continent&quot;) is written as {{lang|zh|美洲}}, ''{{transl|zh|guó}}'' (&quot;country&quot;) is written as {{lang|zh|国}}, and ''{{transl|zh|zhōu}}'' (&quot;continent&quot;) is written as {{lang|zh|洲}}.&lt;ref name=zh-dict-us /&gt;&lt;ref name=zh-dict-america /&gt;&lt;ref name=zh-dict-country /&gt;&lt;ref name=zh-dict-continent /&gt;}}

==History==
[[Image:Bowen America.png|thumb|300px|British map of America in 1744.]]

The name ''America'' was derived by [[Martin Waldseemüller]] from ''Americus Vespucius'', the Latinized version of [[Amerigo Vespucci]], the name of the Italian merchant and cartographer who explored South America's east coast and the [[Caribbean]] Sea in the early 16th century. Later, Vespucci's published letters were the basis of [[Waldseemüller map|Waldseemüller's 1507 map]], which is the first usage of ''America''. The adjective ''American'' subsequently denotes the New World's peoples and things.

16th-century European usage of ''American'' denoted the native inhabitants of the New World.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;&gt;{{subscription required}} {{cite encyclopedia|url=http://dictionary.oed.com.dax.lib.unf.edu/cgi/entry/50007152?query_type=word&amp;queryword=American&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=870u-gw0naW-7329&amp;hilite=50007152|title=American|encyclopedia=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|accessdate=November 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest recorded use of this term in English is in [[Thomas Hacket]]'s 1568 translation of [[André Thévet]]'s book ''[[France Antarctique]]''; Thévet himself had referred to the natives as ''Ameriques''.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;/&gt; In the following century, the term was extended to European settlers and their descendants in the Americas. The earliest recorded use of this term in English dates to 1648, in [[Thomas Gage (clergyman)|Thomas Gage]]'s ''The English-American: A New Survet of the West Indies''.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;/&gt;{{contradiction-inline|date=October 2013}} In English, ''American'' was used especially for people in the [[British America]], and came to be applied to citizens of the United States when the country was formed.&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;/&gt; The [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] refers to &quot;[the] unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America&quot; adopted by the &quot;Representatives of the united States of America&quot; on July 4, 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/declaration_zoom_2.html|title=Declaration of Independence|publisher=National Archives|date=July 4, 1776}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official name of the country was established on November 15, 1777, when the [[Second Continental Congress]] adopted the [[Articles of Confederation]], the first of which says, &quot;The Stile of this Confederacy shall be 'The United States of America'&quot;. The Articles further state:
{{quote|In Witness whereof we have hereunto set our hands in Congress. Done at Philadelphia in the State of Pennsylvania the ninth day of July in the Year of our Lord One Thousand Seven Hundred and Seventy-Eight, and in the Third Year of the independence of America.}}

Common short forms and abbreviations are the ''United States'', the ''U.S.'', the ''U.S.A.'', and ''America''; colloquial versions include the ''U.S. of A.'' and ''the States''. The term ''[[Columbia (name)|Columbia]]'' (from the Columbus surname), was a popular name for the U.S. and for the entire geographic Americas; its usage is present today only in the [[District of Columbia]]'s name. Moreover, the womanly personification of Columbia appears in some official documents, including editions of the U.S. dollar.

In [[The Federalist Papers|''The Federalist'' Papers]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]] used ''American'' with two different meanings: political and geographic; &quot;the American republic&quot; in [[Federalist No. 51]] and in [[Federalist No. 70]],&lt;ref name=federalist51&gt;{{cite book|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Federalist/51|chapter=The Structure of the Government Must Furnish the Proper Checks and Balances Between the Different Departments|title=The Federalist|number=51|author=Madison, James}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=federalist70&gt;{{cite book|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Federalist_Papers/No._70|author=Hamilton, Alexander|chapter=The Executive Department Further Considered|title=The Federalist|number=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in [[Federalist No. 24]], Hamilton used ''American'' to denote the lands beyond the U.S.'s political borders.&lt;ref name=federalist24&gt;{{cite book | first = Alexander | last = Hamilton | title = ''The Federalist'' Papers | number = 24 | url = http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Federalist/24l | chapter = The Powers Necessary to the Common Defense Further Considered}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Washington's Farewell Address.jpg|thumb|Washington's Farewell Address]]
United States President [[George Washington]]'s 1796 Farewell Address said, &quot;The name of American, which belongs to you in your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of patriotism more than any appellation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Washington%27s_Farewell_Address|title=Washington's Farewell Address|year=1796|author=Washington, George}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early official U.S. documents show inconsistent usage; the [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)|1778 Treaty of Alliance]] with [[France]] used &quot;the United States of North America&quot; in the first sentence, then &quot;the said United States&quot; afterwards; &quot;the United States of America&quot; and &quot;the United States of North America&quot; derive from &quot;the United Colonies of America&quot; and &quot;the United Colonies of North America&quot;. The Treaty of Peace and Amity of September 5, 1795 between the United States and the [[Barbary States]] contains the usages &quot;the United States of North America&quot;, &quot;citizens of the United States&quot;, and &quot;American Citizens&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/bar1795t.asp | title = The Barbary Treaties: Treaty of Peace and Amity}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{synthesis-inline|date=October 2013}}

Originally, the name &quot;the United States&quot; was plural—&quot;the United States are&quot;—a usage found in the U.S. Constitution's [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]] (1865), but its current usage is singular—&quot;the United States is&quot;. The plural was set in the term &quot;these United States&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002663.html |last = Zimmer |first = Benjamin |authorlink = Benjamin Zimmer |date=November 24, 2005|title=Life in These, uh, This United States |work = [[Language Log]] |publisher =[[University of Pennsylvania]] |accessdate=February 22, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080220231426/http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002663.html| archivedate= February 20, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Semantic divergence among [[English-speaking world|Anglophones]] did not affect the Spanish colonies. In 1801, the document titled ''Letter to American Spaniards''—published in French (1799), in Spanish (1801), and in English (1808)—might have influenced [[Venezuela]]'s [[Venezuelan Declaration of Independence|Act of Independence]] and its 1811 constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.histal.umontreal.ca/espanol/documentos/la%20carta%20dirigida%20a%20los%20espanoles%20americanos.htm | title = La &quot;Carta dirigida a los españoles americanos&quot;, una carta que recorrió muchos caminos..|trans_title=The &quot;Letter directed to Spanish Americans&quot;, a letter that traversed many paths...|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127135222/http://www.histal.umontreal.ca/espanol/documentos/la%20carta%20dirigida%20a%20los%20espanoles%20americanos.htm|archivedate=January 27, 2010|author=Bastin, Georges L.

The use of ''American'' as a national [[demonym]] for U.S. nationals is challenged, primarily by Latin Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mencken&quot;/&gt; Spanish speakers in Spain and Latin America use the term ''{{lang|es|estadounidense}}'' to refer to people and things from the United States (from ''{{lang|es|Estados Unidos}}''), while ''{{lang|es|americano}}'' refers to the continent as a whole.&lt;ref name=rae-americano /&gt;&lt;ref name=rae-estadounidense&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Diccionario de la lengua española|title=estadounidense|url=http://lema.rae.es/drae/?val=estadounidense|publisher=Real Academia Española|quote=[Translated:] 1. adj. Native of the United States of America|language=es}} [Original:] &quot;1. adj. Natural de los Estados Unidos de América.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 1992 edition the ''{{lang|es|Diccionario de la lengua española}}'', published by the [[Real Academia Española]], did not include the United States definition in the entry for ''{{lang|es|americano}}''; this was added in the 2001 edition.&lt;ref name=rae-americano /&gt;{{efn|name=rae-americano-note}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|publisher=Real Academia Española|encyclopedia=Diccionario usual|year=1992|edition=21st|page=89|title=americano|url=http://buscon.rae.es/ntlle/SrvltGUILoginNtlle|language=es}} To access, click the magnifying glass in the upper left-hand corner. In the field titled &quot;Lema&quot;, type &quot;americano&quot;; for the &quot;Resultados&quot; radio buttons, select &quot;Diccionario&quot;; in the field in the selection field for &quot;Diccionarios&quot;, make sure that &quot;1992 Academica Usual&quot; is selected. Then click &quot;Buscar&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The Real Academia Española specifically advises against using ''{{lang|es|americanos}}'' exclusively for U.S. nationals:&lt;ref name=rae-estadosunidos /&gt;
{{quote|[Translated] It is common, and thus acceptable, to use ''{{lang|es|norteamericano}}'' as a synonym of ''{{lang|es|estadounidense}}'', even though strictly speaking, the term ''norteamericano'' can equally be used to refer to the inhabitants of any country in the Americas or North America, it currently applies to the inhabitants of the United States.{{efn|name=rae-americano-note|[Untranslated] {{lang|es|Está muy generalizado, y resulta aceptable, el uso de norteamericano como sinónimo de estadounidense, ya que, aunque en rigor el término norteamericano podría usarse igualmente en alusión a los habitantes de cualquiera de los países de América del Norte o Norteamérica, se aplica corrientemente a los habitantes de los Estados Unidos.}} }} }}

===Canada===
Modern Canadians typically refer to people from the United States as ''Americans'', though they seldom refer to the United States as ''America''; they use the terms ''the United States'', ''the U.S.'', or (informally) ''the States'' instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxfcdn&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Fee, Margery|author2=McAlpine, J.|year=1997|title=Oxford Guide to Canadian English Usage|isbn=0-19-541619-8|location=Toronto|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canadians rarely apply the term ''American'' to themselves – some Canadians resent either being referred to as Americans because of mistaken assumptions that they are U.S. citizens or others' inability, particularly of those overseas, to distinguish [[Canadian English|Canadian]] from [[American English|American]] [[Accent (dialect)|accents]].&lt;ref name=&quot;oxfcdn&quot; /&gt; Some Canadians have protested the use of ''American'' as a national demonym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=de Ford|first=Miriam Allen|date=April 1927|title=On the difficulty of indicating nativity in the United States|journal=American Speech|page=315}}&lt;/ref&gt; People of U.S. ethnic origin in Canada are categorized as &quot;Other North American origins&quot; by [[Statistics Canada]] for purposes of [[census]] counts (as opposed to &quot;Canadian&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/demo26a-eng.htm|title=Population by selected ethnic origins, by province and territory (2006 Census)|publisher=Statistics Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portugal and Brazil===
Generally, ''{{lang|pt|americano}}'' denotes &quot;U.S. citizen&quot; in [[Portugal]].&lt;ref name=pt-americano /&gt; Usage of ''{{lang|pt|americano}}'' to exclusively denote people and things of the U.S. is discouraged by the [[Academia das Ciências de Lisboa|Lisbon Academy of Sciences]], because the specific word ''{{lang|pt|estado-unidense}}'' (also ''{{lang|pt|estadunidense}}'') clearly denotes a person from the United States. The term currently used by the Portuguese press is ''{{lang|pt|norte-americano}}''.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In [[Brazil]], the term ''{{lang|pt|americano}}'' is used to address both that which pertains to the American continent and, in current speech, that which pertains to the U.S.; the particular meaning is deduced from context. Alternatively, the term ''{{lang|pt|norte-americano}}'' (&quot;North American&quot;) is also used in more informal contexts, while ''{{lang|pt|estadunidense}}'' (of the U.S.) is the preferred form in academia. Use of the three terms is common in schools, government, and media. The term ''{{lang|pt|América}}'' is used almost exclusively for the continent, and the U.S. is called ''{{lang|pt|Estados Unidos}}'' (&quot;United States&quot;) or ''{{lang|pt|Estados Unidos da América}}'' (&quot;United States of America&quot;), often abbreviated ''{{lang|pt|EUA}}''.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The Getting Through Customs website advises business travelers not to use &quot;in America&quot; as a U.S. reference when conducting business in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Morrison| first =Terri| authorlink =|title =Doing business abroad – Brazil| work =| publisher =| date =| url =http://www.getcustoms.com/2004GTC/Articles/oag_11.html| doi =| accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other contexts==
&quot;American&quot; in the 1994 ''[[AP Stylebook|Associated Press Stylebook]]'' was defined as, &quot;An acceptable description for a resident of the United States. It also may be applied to any resident or citizen of nations in North or South America.&quot; Elsewhere, the ''AP Stylebook'' indicates that &quot;United States&quot; must &quot;be spelled out when used as a noun. Use U.S. (no space) only as an adjective.&quot;{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

The entry for &quot;America&quot; in ''[[The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage]]'' from 1999 reads:
{{quote|[the] terms &quot;America&quot;, &quot;American(s)&quot; and &quot;Americas&quot; refer not only to the United States, but to all of North America and South America. They may be used in any of their senses, including references to just the United States, if the context is clear. The countries of the Western Hemisphere are collectively 'the Americas'.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}}}

Media releases from the [[Pope]] and [[Holy See]] frequently use &quot;America&quot; to refer to the United States, and &quot;American&quot; to denote something or someone from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite speech|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/homilies/1965/documents/hf_p-vi_hom_19651004_yankee-stadium_en.html|title=Homily of the Holy Father Paul VI|location=Yankee Stadium, New York|date=October 4, 1965|authorlink=Pope Paul VI|author=Pope Paul VI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International law===
{{synthesis|date=October 2013}}
At least one international law uses ''U.S. citizen'' in defining a citizen of the United States rather than ''American citizen''; for example, the English version of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] includes:
{{quote|Only air carriers that are &quot;citizens of the United States&quot; may operate aircraft in domestic air service (cabotage) and may provide international scheduled and non-scheduled air service as U.S. air carriers...
Under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, a &quot;citizen of the United States&quot; means:
:(a) an individual who is a U.S. citizen;
:(b) a partnership in which each member is a U.S. citizen; or
:(c) a U.S. corporation of which the president and at least two-thirds of the board of directors and other managing officers are U.S. citizens, and at least 75 percent of the voting interest in the corporation is owned or controlled by U.S. citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sice.oas.org/trade/nafta/anx1usa.asp | work = North American Free Trade Agreement|title=Annex I: Reservations for Existing Measures and Liberalization Commitments (Chapters 11, 12, and 14) |date= October 7, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many international treaties use the terms ''American'' and ''American citizen'':
* 1796 – The treaty between the United States and the [[Dey]] of the Regency of [[Algiers]] on March 7, 1796 protected &quot;American citizens&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/georgewashington/collection/pres_1796mar7.html|title= Treaty between US and the Dey and Regency of Algiers, March 7, 1796|work=Gilder Lehrman Collection Documents|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1806 – The [[Louisiana Purchase Treaty]] between [[France]] and United States referred to &quot;American citizens&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/resources/archives/one/louispur.htm |title=The Louisiana Purchase Treaty|work=Archives of The West|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1825 – The treaty between the United States and the [[Cheyenne]] tribe refers to &quot;American citizen&quot;s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpeople.us/FP-Html-Treaties/TreatyWithTheCheyenneTribe1825.html|title=Treaty with The Cheyenne Tribe|date=July 6, 1825}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1848 – The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] between [[Mexico]] and the U.S. uses &quot;American Government&quot; to refer to the United States, and &quot;American tribunals&quot; to refer to U.S. courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laprensa-sandiego.org/archieve/september21/treaty.htm|title=The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo|work=La Prensa}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1858 – The [[Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States-Japan)|Treaty of Amity and Commerce]] between the United States and [[Japan]] protected &quot;American citizens&quot; and also used &quot;American&quot; in other contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://core.ecu.edu/hist/tuckerjo/harris.html|title=The Treaty of Amity and Commerce Between the United States and Japan, 1858 (The Harris Treaty)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1898 – The [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] ending the [[Spanish–American War]], known in Spanish as the ''{{lang|es|Guerra Hispano–Estadounidense}}'' (&quot;Spain–United States War&quot;) uses &quot;American&quot; in reference to United States troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/sp1898.asp|title=Treaty of Peace Between the United States and Spain; December 10, 1898}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1966 – The [[Treaty of Amity and Economic Relations (Thailand–United States)|United States–Thailand Treaty of Amity]] protects &quot;Americans&quot; and &quot;American corporations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bia.co.th/006.html|title=The United States–Thailand Treaty of Amity|work=Thailand Business and Legal Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. commercial regulation===
Products that are labeled, advertised, and marketed in the U.S. as &quot;[[Made in USA label|Made in the USA]]&quot; must be, as set by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), &quot;all or virtually all made in the U.S.&quot; The FTC, to prevent deception of customers and unfair competition, considers an unqualified claim of &quot;American Made&quot; to expressly claim exclusive manufacture in the U.S: &quot;The [[FTC Act]] gives the Commission the power to bring law enforcement actions against false or misleading claims that a product is of U.S. origin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/madeusa.htm|title=Complying with the Made In the USA Standard|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216200917/http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/madeusa.htm|archivedate=February 16, 2006|publisher=Federal Trade Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
{{Main|Names for U.S. citizens}}
There are a number of alternatives to the [[demonym]] ''American'' as a citizen of the United States that do not simultaneously mean any inhabitant of the Americas. One uncommon alternative is ''[[Usonian]]'', which usually describes a certain style of residential [[architecture]] designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]. Other alternatives have also surfaced, but most have fallen into disuse and obscurity. ''[[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage]]'' says:
{{quote|The list contains (in approximate historical order from 1789 to 1939) such terms as Columbian, Columbard, Fredonian, Frede, Unisian, United Statesian, Colonican, Appalacian, Usian, Washingtonian, Usonian, Uessian, U-S-ian, Uesican, United Stater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of English Usage|page=88|publisher=Merriam-Webster|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Nevertheless, no alternative to ''American'' is common.&lt;ref name=Wilson /&gt;
