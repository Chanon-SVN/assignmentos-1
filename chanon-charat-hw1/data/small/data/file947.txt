ASU is classified as a [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education#Basic classification|research university with very high research activity]] (RU/VH) by the [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education]]. Since 2005 ASU has been ranked among the top research universities, public and private, in the U.S. based on research output, innovation, development, research expenditures, number of awarded patents and awarded research grant proposals. [[The Center for Measuring University Performance]] currently ranks ASU 31st among top U.S. public research universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Top American Research Universities|url=http://mup.asu.edu/research2012.pdf|website=MUP|publisher=Center for Measuring University Performance|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASU's charter, approved by the [[Higher education governing board|board of regents]] in 2014, is based on the &quot;New American University&quot; model created by current ASU President [[Michael M. Crow|Michael Crow]]. It defines ASU as “a comprehensive public research university, measured not by whom we exclude, but rather by whom we include and how they succeed; advancing research and discovery of public value; and assuming fundamental responsibility for the economic, social, cultural and overall health of the communities it serves.”

ASU awards bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees through 16 colleges and schools across all of its campuses: the original Tempe campus, the West campus in northwest Phoenix, the Polytechnic campus in eastern Mesa, the Downtown Phoenix campus, The Mayo Clinic/ASU Medical School in Scottsdale, and the Colleges at Lake Havasu City.

==History==
{{Main|History of Arizona State University}}
[[File:Pres. Theodore Roosevelt at Old Main of Arizona State University.jpg|thumb|left|President Theodore Roosevelt addresses a crowd of students on the steps of the Old Main at Arizona State University, March 20, 1911.]]

===1885–1929===
[[File:Arizona State University Old Main circa 1890.jpg|thumb|Old Main on the Arizona State University campus, circa 1890]]

Arizona State University was established as the '''Territorial Normal School''' at Tempe on March 12, 1885, when the [[13th Arizona Territorial Legislature]] passed an act to create a [[normal school]] to train teachers for the [[Arizona Territory]]. The campus consisted of a single, four-room schoolhouse on a 20-acre plot largely donated by Tempe residents George and Martha Wilson. Classes began with 33 students on February 8, 1886. The curriculum evolved over the years and the name was changed several times; the institution was also known as '''Arizona Territorial Normal School''' (1889–1896), '''Arizona Normal School ''' (1896–1899), '''Normal School of Arizona''' (1899–1901), and '''Tempe Normal School''' (1901–1925). The school accepted both high school students and graduates, and awarded high school diplomas and teaching certificates to those who completed the requirements.&lt;ref name=TNS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Academicprograms/&gt;

In 1923 the school stopped offering high school courses and added a high school diploma to the admissions requirements. In 1925 the school became the '''Tempe State Teachers College''' and offered four-year Bachelor of Education degrees as well as two-year teaching certificates. In 1929, the legislature authorized Bachelor of Arts in Education degrees as well, and the school was renamed the '''Arizona State Teachers College'''.&lt;ref name=TNS/&gt;&lt;ref name=Academicprograms/&gt; Under the 30-year tenure of president Arthur John Matthews the school was given all-college student status. The first dormitories built in the state were constructed under his supervision. Of the 18 buildings constructed while Matthews was president, six are still currently in use. Matthews envisioned an &quot;evergreen campus,&quot; with many shrubs brought to the campus, and implemented the planting of [[Palm Walk]], now a landmark of the Tempe campus. His legacy is being continued to this day with the main campus having been declared a nationally recognized arboretum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/fm/arboretum.htm The Arboretum at Arizona State University] ASU&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Great Depression]], Ralph W. Swetman was hired as president for a three-year term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/preslist.htm Archives &amp; Special Collections, Principals and Presidents of Arizona State University] ASU&lt;/ref&gt; Although enrollment increased by almost 100 percent during his tenure due to the depression, many faculty were terminated and faculty salaries were cut.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/11lead.htm Eighth President Ralph Waldo Swetman 1930–1933]&quot; ASU&lt;/ref&gt;

===1930–1989===
[[Image:FLW Gammage Auditorium ASU PHX AZ 20186.JPG|thumb|ASU's [[Gammage Auditorium]], designed by [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]]]

In 1933, [[Grady Gammage]], then president of [[Northern Arizona University|Arizona State Teachers College at Flagstaff]], became president of ASU, a tenure that would last for nearly 28 years. Like his predecessor, Gammage oversaw construction of a number of buildings on the Tempe campus. He also oversaw the development of the university, graduate programs. The school's name was changed to '''Arizona State College''' in 1945, and finally to   '''Arizona State University''' in 1958.

By the 1960s, with the presidency of [[G. Homer Durham]], the University began to expand its academic curriculum by establishing several new colleges and beginning to award Doctor of Philosophy and other doctoral degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/16lead.htm ASU Libraries: The New ASU Story: Leadership] ASU&lt;/ref&gt;

The next three presidents—Harry K. Newburn, 1969–71, John W. Schwada, 1971–81, and J. Russell Nelson, 1981–89—and Interim President Richard Peck, 1989, led the university to increased academic stature, creation of the [[Arizona State University at the West campus|West campus]], and rising enrollment.

===1990–present===
Under the leadership of [[Lattie F. Coor]], from 1990 to 2002, ASU grew through the creation of the [[Arizona State University at the Polytechnic campus|Polytechnic campus]] and extended education sites. Increased commitment to diversity, quality in [[undergraduate education]], research, and economic development occurred   over his 12-year tenure. Part of his legacy to the university was a successful fund-raising campaign: through private donations, more than $500&amp;nbsp;million was invested in areas that would significantly impact the future of ASU. Among the campaign's achievements were the naming and endowing of [[Barrett, The Honors College]], and the [[Herberger College of the Arts|Katherine K. Herberger College of Fine Arts]]; the creation of many new endowed faculty positions; and hundreds of new scholarships and fellowships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/21lead.htm ASU Libraries: The New ASU Story: Leadership] ASU&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Asubiodesign.jpg|thumb|ASU's [[Biodesign Institute]] on Tempe campus]]

On July 1, 2002, [[Michael M. Crow]] became the university's 16th president. At his inauguration, he outlined his vision for transforming ASU into a &quot;New American University&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newamericanuniversity.asu.edu/ |title=newamericanuniversity.asu.edu |publisher=newamericanuniversity.asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;—one  that would be open and inclusive, with a goal set for the university to meet [[Association of American Universities]] (AAU) criteria and to become a member.&lt;ref name=&quot;president.asu.edu&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, he initiated the idea of transforming ASU into &quot;One University in Many Places&quot; by merging ASU's several campuses into a single institution, sharing students, faculty, staff and accreditation. Aided by hundreds of millions of dollars in donations, ASU embarked on a years-long research facility capital building effort, resulting in the establishment of the [[Biodesign Institute]] and several large interdisciplinary research buildings. Along with the research facilities, the university faculty was expanded, including the addition of three [[Nobel Laureates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://asunews.asu.edu/20091012_ostrom_nobel Nobel Prize Winners] ASU News&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ASU's [[Arizona State University at the Downtown Phoenix campus|Downtown Phoenix]] campus was vastly expanded with several of the University's colleges and schools relocated to the downtown campus. Since fiscal year 2002 the university's research expenditures have tripled and more than 1.5&amp;nbsp;million sq. ft. of new research space has been added to the university's research facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://asunews.asu.edu/20121115_naustory |title=ASU's 'golden decade' and the rise of a New American University &amp;#124; ASU News |publisher=Asunews.asu.edu |date=2012-11-16 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Great Recession|economic downturn]] that began in 2008 took a particularly hard toll on Arizona, resulting in large cuts to ASU's budget.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2009/01/16/20090116capitol-budget0116.html Budget Cuts Proposal] Arizona Republic&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these cuts, ASU underwent several rounds of reorganizations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asunews.asu.edu/20090121_reorg |title=Academic Reorganization |publisher=Asunews.asu.edu |date=2009-01-21 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; combining academic departments, consolidating colleges and schools, and reducing university staff and administrators; however, with an economic recovery underway in 2011, the university continued its campaign to expand the West and Polytechnic Campuses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright |first=Lesley |url=http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/2011/06/19/20110619asu-academic-villages.html |title=ASU Building Academic Villages |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=2011-06-19 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and establishing a set of low-cost, teaching-focused extension campuses in [[Lake Havasu City]] and [[Payson, Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://havasu.asu.edu |title=Colleges @ ASU – Lake Havasu |publisher=Havasu.asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university has announced that a new building for the Sandra Day O’Connor College of Law will be built on the Downtown Phoenix Campus, relocating faculty and students from the Tempe Campus.

{{Main|Arizona Board of Regents}}

The Arizona Board of Regents governs Arizona State University as well as the other state's public universities; [[University of Arizona]] and [[Northern Arizona University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azregents.edu/universities/arizonastateuniversity/default.aspx |title=Arizona State University |publisher=Azregents.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Board of Regents is composed of twelve members including eleven voting, and one non-voting member. Members of the board include the Governor and the Superintendent of Public Instruction acting as ex-officio members, eight volunteer Regent members with eight years term that are appointed by the Governor, and two Student Regents with two years term, serving a one-year term as non-voting apprentices. [[Arizona Board of Regents|ABOR]] provides policy guidance to the state universities of Arizona. ASU has multiple campus locations, covering the Phoenix metropolitan areas including the Main Tempe campus in Tempe, the West campus and Downtown Phoenix campus both in Phoenix, and the Polytechnic campus in Mesa. It also offers courses and degrees through ASU online to advance the mission of the university.

The Arizona Board of Regents appoints and elects the president of the university, who is considered the chief executive officer and the chief budget officer of the institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asu.edu/aad/manuals/acd/acd102.html |title=Arizona State University |publisher=Asu.edu |date=2011-01-07 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president is responsible for the execution of measures enacted by the Board of Regents, controls the property of the university, and acts as the official representative of the university to the Board of Regents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azregents.edu/policymanual/default.aspx |title=Policy Manual |publisher=Azregents.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chief executive officer is assisted through the administration of the institution by the provost, vice presidents, deans, faculty, directors, department chairs, and other officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asu.edu/admin/ |title=ASU Leadership |publisher=Asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The president also selects and appoints administrative officers and general counsels. The 16th and current ASU president is Michael M. Crow, and has served since July 1, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://president.asu.edu |title=Office of the President Home &amp;#124; Office of the President |publisher=President.asu.edu |date=2014-05-18 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campuses and locations==
ASU's academic programs are spread across campuses in the [[Phoenix Metropolitan Area]]; however, unlike most multi-campus institutions, ASU describes itself as &quot;one university in many places,&quot; inferring that there is &quot;not a system with separate campuses, and not one main campus with branch campuses.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://campus.asu.edu One University in Many Places] Arizona State University&lt;/ref&gt; The university considers each campus &quot;distinctive&quot; and academically focused on certain aspects of the overall university mission. The Tempe Campus is the university's research and graduate school center. Undergraduate studies on the Tempe campus are research-based programs designed to prepare students for graduate school, professional school, or employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Virtual TourParkingCampus Map |url=http://campus.asu.edu/tempe |title=Arizona State University |publisher=Campus.asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Polytechnic campus is designed with an emphasis on professional and technological programs for direct workforce preparation.

[[File:ASU-SolarArray.jpg|thumb|Solar panel array on the roof deck of ASU's parking structure on Apache Blvd. in Tempe, AZ.]]
As of April 2013, ASU is the only institution of higher education in the United States to generate over 20 megawatts (MW) of electricity from [[solar arrays]]; an increase over the June 2012 total of 15.3 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://asunews.asu.edu/20110906_ASU10MWSolar |title=Sun Devils soak up solar power &amp;#124; ASU News |publisher=Asunews.asu.edu |date=2011-09-06 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cfo.asu.edu/solar-faq |title=Solar: FAQs &amp;#124; Business and Finance |publisher=Cfo.asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASU has 72 [[Photovoltaic system|solar photovoltaic]] (PV) installations across all four campuses. The largest concentration of solar PV installations are on the Tempe campus, producing over 12.8 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cm.asu.edu/solar/ |title=solar: homepage &amp;#124; Business and Finance |publisher=Cm.asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there are six [[wind turbines]] installed on the roof of the Julie Ann Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability building on the Tempe campus that have been in operation since October 2008. Under normal conditions, the six turbines produce enough electricity to power approximately 36 computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainability.asu.edu/news/gios-news/wind-turbines |title=Institute News / Global Institute of Sustainability / Arizona State University |publisher=Sustainability.asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASU's [[ASU School of Sustainability|School of Sustainability]] is the first school in the United States dedicated to exploring the principles of [[sustainability]]. ASU's School of Sustainability is part of the Wrigley Global Institute of Sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://schoolofsustainability.asu.edu/about/school-of-sustainability.php School of Sustainability // School of Sustainability // Arizona State University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The School was established in spring 2007 and began enrolling undergraduates in fall 2008.

The School of Sustainability has been essential in establishing the university as &quot;a leader in the academics of sustainable business.&quot; The university is widely considered to be one of the most ambitious and principled organizations when it comes to embedding sustainable practices into its [[operating model]].&lt;ref name=&quot;greenbiz1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Clancy |first=Heather |url=http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2013/08/16/asu-sustainable-procurement-isnt-just-academic-exercise |title=At ASU, sustainable procurement isn't just an academic exercise |publisher=GreenBiz.com |date=2013-08-16 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university has embraced several challenging sustainability [[benchmarking|benchmarks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainability.asu.edu/flip-book/prospectus/ |title=Flipbook Prospectus / Global Institute of Sustainability / Arizona State University |publisher=Sustainability.asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the numerous benchmarks outlined in the university's [[Concept note|prospectus]], is the creation of a large [[recycling]] and [[compost]]ing operation that by 2015, will eliminate 90% of the [[solid waste]] generated by all on-campus activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solidwaste.com/doc/waste-management-of-arizona-driving-arizona-0001 |title=Waste Management Of Arizona Driving Arizona State University's Roadmap To Zero Solid Waste |publisher=Solidwaste.com |date=2012-02-08 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This endeavor will be aided by educating students about the benefits of avoiding [[overconsumption]] that contributes to excessive waste. Sustainability courses have been expanded to attain this goal and many of the university's individual colleges and schools have integrated such material into their [[lecture]]s and courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://asunews.asu.edu/20110825_AASHEGoldASUSustainabilityAchievements |title=ASU's sustainability achievements rated GOLD &amp;#124; ASU News |publisher=Asunews.asu.edu |date=2011-08-25 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stars.aashe.org/institutions/arizona-state-university-az/report/2011-07-29/ |title=Arizona State University &amp;#124; Scorecard &amp;#124; Institutions &amp;#124; AASHE STARS |publisher=Stars.aashe.org |date=2011-07-29 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, ASU is on track to reduce its rate of water consumption by 50%. The university's most aggressive benchmark is to be the first, large research university to achieve [[carbon neutrality]] as it pertains to its [[Enterprise carbon accounting|Scope 1, 2]] and non-transportation Scope 3 [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions.&lt;ref name=&quot;greenbiz1&quot;/&gt;

==Traditions==

===Maroon and Gold===
[[File:Sparky the Sun Devil vs USC 2011.jpg|thumbnail|Sparky the Sun Devil with his [[trident]], 2011]]
Gold is the oldest color associated with Arizona State University and dates back to 1896 when the school was named the Tempe Normal School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alumni.asu.edu/remember/traditions |title=Sun Devil Traditions &amp;#124; ASU Alumni Association |publisher=Alumni.asu.edu |date=2014-04-26 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maroon and white were later added to the color scheme in 1898. Gold signifies the “golden promise” of ASU. The promise includes every student receiving a valuable educational experience. Gold also signifies the sunshine Arizona is famous for; including the power of the sun and its influence on the climate and the economy. The first uniforms worn by athletes associated with the university were black and white when the “Normals” were the name of the athletic teams. The student section, known as The Inferno, wears gold on game days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundevils.com/tickets/asu-student-tix.html |title=Arizona State University &amp;#124; Online Ticket Office &amp;#124; Sorry |publisher=Thesundevils.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mascot and Spirit Squad===
{{Main|Sparky the Sun Devil}}
[[Sparky the Sun Devil]] is the mascot of Arizona State University and was named by vote of the student body on November 8, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundevils.com/ot/sparky.html |title=Arizona State University Official Athletic Site - Athletics - Arizona State Sun Devils |publisher=Thesundevils.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sparky often travels with the team across the country and has been at every football [[bowl game]] in which the university has participated in. The university's mascot is not to be confused with the university’s new emblem and logo, The [[Trident]], colloquially referred to as the ''fork'' or the ''[[Pitchfork (hand gesture)|pitchfork]]'' which is a hand gesture used by those associated with the university. The new logo and emblem are used on various university property, sport facilities, uniforms and documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arizona.sbnation.com/arizona-st-sun-devils/2011/4/12/2106994/arizona-state-university-asu-sun-devils-to-unveil-new-uniforms-colors-logo-etc |title=ASU's Uniforms And Logos Set To Make Debut: Consider The Fork, Feared - SB Nation Arizona |publisher=Arizona.sbnation.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arizona State Teacher’s College had a different mascot and the sports teams were known as the Owls and later, the Bulldogs. When the school was first established, the Tempe Normal School’s teams were simply known as the Normals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.territorialcupseries.com/genrel/history.html |title=State Farm Territorial Cup Series |publisher=Territorialcupseries.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sparky is visible on the sidelines of every home game played in [[Sun Devil Stadium]] or other ASU athletic facilities. His routine at football games includes pushups after every touchdown scored by the Sun Devils. He is aided by Sparky's Crew, male yell leaders that must meet physical requirements in order to participate as members. The female members are known as the Spirit Squad and are categorized into a dance line and spirit line. They are the official squad that represents ASU. The spirit squad competes every year at the ESPN Universal Dance Association (UDA) College Nationals in the Jazz and Hip-Hop categories. They were chosen by the UDA to represent the USA at the World Dance Championship 2013 in the Jazz category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundevils.com/genrel/asu-cheer-intro.html |title=Arizona State University Official Athletic Site - Athletics News - Arizona State Sun Devils |publisher=Thesundevils.com |date=2014-04-03 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, ASU's varsity intercollegiate [[cheerleading]] team is not allowed to participate at athletic events (e.g. football and basketball games) due to dismissal regarding prior misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sundevilcheerleaders.webs.com/ourpurpose.htm ]{{dead link|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASU Cheerleading has since become a club sport, through the Student Recreation Center, competing locally and nationally as a Collegiate Co-Ed Division IA-Level VI team.

===“A” Mountain===
{{Main|Tempe Butte}}
A letter has existed on the slope of the mountain since 1918. A &quot;T&quot; followed by an &quot;N&quot; were the first letters to grace the landmark. [[Tempe Butte]], home to &quot;A&quot; Mountain, has had the &quot;A&quot; installed on the slope of its south face since 1938 and is visible from campus just to the south. The original &quot;A&quot; was destroyed by vandals in 1952 with pipe bombs and a new &quot;A&quot;, constructed of reinforced concrete, was built in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asu.edu/tour/tempe/amtn.html |title=ASU Tempe Campus Tour: &quot;A&quot; Mountain |publisher=Asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vandals were never identified but many speculate that the conspirators were students from the rival in-state university (University of Arizona). Many ancient  [[Hohokam]] [[petroglyph]]s were destroyed by the bomb; nevertheless, many of these archeological sites around the mountain remain. There are many traditions surrounding &quot;A&quot; Mountain, including a revived &quot;guarding of the 'A'&quot; in which students camp on the mountainside before games with rival schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc15&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/region_southeast_valley/tempe/asu-students-guarding-'a'-mountain-from-wildcat-faithful|title=ASU students guarding 'A' mountain from Wildcat faithful|publisher=web.archive.org|accessdate=June 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Whitewashing&quot; of the &quot;A&quot; is a tradition in which incoming freshmen paint the letter white during orientation week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alumni.asu.edu/groups/students/saa/events/whitewash |title=Whitewash the &quot;A&quot; &amp;#124; ASU Alumni Association |publisher=Alumni.asu.edu |date=2014-04-26 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the painting of the &quot;A&quot;, new students learn the history of ASU and its other traditions.

[[File:Lantern Walk.jpg|thumb|Old newspaper clipping describing the Lantern Walk tradition at ASU, May 30, 1929]]

===Lantern Walk and Homecoming===
The Lantern Walk is one of the oldest traditions at ASU and dates back to 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alumni.asu.edu/groups/students/saa/events/lantern-walk |title=Lantern Walk &amp;#124; ASU Alumni Association |publisher=Alumni.asu.edu |date=2014-04-26 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered one of ASU’s “most cherished” traditions and is an occasion used to mark the work of those associated with ASU throughout history. Anyone associated with ASU is free to participate in the event, including students, alumni, faculty, employees, and friends. This differs slightly from the original tradition in which the seniors would carry lanterns up &quot;A&quot; Mountain followed by the freshman. The senior class president would describe ASU's traditions and the freshman would repeat an oath of allegiance to the university. It was described as a tradition of &quot;good will between the classes&quot; and a way of ensuring new students would continue the university's traditions with honor. In modern times, the participants walk through campus and follow a path up to “A” Mountain in order to “light up” Tempe. Keynote speakers, performances, and other events are used to mark the occasion. The night is culminated with a fireworks display. The Lantern Walk was held after the Spring Semester (June) but is now held the week before [[Homecoming]], a tradition that dates back to 1924 at ASU. It is held in the fall and in conjunction with a football game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homecoming.asu.edu/ |title=ASU homecoming &amp;#124; ASU Homecoming |publisher=Homecoming.asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victory Bell===
Arizona State University reintroduced the tradition of ringing a bell after each win for the football team in  2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://asunews.asu.edu/20121119_victorybell |title=Sun Devil Athletics brings back Victory Bell in return to tradition &amp;#124; ASU News |publisher=Asunews.asu.edu |date=2012-11-19 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ROTC cadets associated with the university are responsible for the transportation of the bell to various events and for ringing the bell after games are won by the Sun Devils. The first Victory Bell, in various forms, was used in the 1930s but the tradition faded in the 1970s when the bell in use was removed from Memorial Union for renovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/asustory/pages/30casc.htm |title=ASU Libraries: The New ASU Story: Campus Lives - Campus Scenes |publisher=Asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bell cracked and was no longer capable of ringing. That bell is located on the southeast corner of Sun Devil Stadium near the entrance to the student section. That bell, given to the university in the late 1960s, is painted gold and is a campus landmark today.

===Sun Devil Marching Band, Devil Walk and Songs of the University===
{{Main|Arizona State University Sun Devil Marching Band}}
[[Sun devil marching band|The Arizona State University Sun Devil Marching Band]], created in 1915 and known as the ''Pride of the Southwest'', was the first of only two [[marching band]]s in the Pac-12 to be awarded the prestigious [[Sudler trophy#The Sudler Trophy|Sudler Trophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sousafoundation.net/Default.aspx?ID=39 |title=The John Philip Sousa Foundation |publisher=Sousafoundation.net |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The John Philip Sousa Foundation awarded the band the trophy in 1991. The Sun Devil Marching Band remains one of only 28 bands in the nation to have earned the designation. The band performs at every football game played in Sun Devil Stadium. Smaller ensembles of band members perform at other sport venues including basketball games at Wells Fargo Arena and baseball games at Packard Stadium. The Devil Walk is held in Wells Fargo Arena by the football team and involves a more formal introduction of the players to the community; a new approach to the tradition added in 2012 with the arrival of [[head coach]] Todd Graham.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arizonasports.com/44/1571028/ASUs-Newest-Tradtion-The-Devil-Walk |title=ASU's Newest Tradition: The Devil Walk |publisher=Arizonasports.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It begins 2 hours and 15 minutes prior to the game and allows the players to establish rapport with the fans. The walk ends as the team passes the band and fans lined along the path to Sun Devil Stadium. The most recognizable songs played by the band are ''Alma Mater'' and ASU’s [[fight songs]] titled ''[[Maroon and gold|Maroon and Gold]]'' and the ''Al Davis Fight Song''. ''Alma Mater'' was composed by former Music Professor and Director of Sun Devil Marching Band (then known as Bulldog Marching Band), Miles A. Dresskell, in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alumni.asu.edu/remember/traditions-arizona-state-university/songs |title=Songs &amp;#124; ASU Alumni Association |publisher=Alumni.asu.edu |date=2014-04-26 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Maroon and Gold'' was authored by former Director of Sun Devil Marching Band, Felix E. McKernan, in 1948. The ''Al Davis Fight Song'' (also known as ''Go, Go Sun Devils'' and ''Arizona State University Fight Song'') was composed by ASU alumnus Albert Oliver Davis in the 1940s without any lyrics. Recently lyrics were added to the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://music.asu.edu/sundevilband/history/tradition.php |title=Tradition &amp;#124; Sun Devil Athletic Bands &amp;#124; School of Music &amp;#124; ASU Herberger Institute for Design and the Arts |publisher=Music.asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extracurricular programs===
Arizona State University has an active [[extracurricular]] involvement program (Sun Devil Involvement Center).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asu.edu/studentaffairs/mu/clubs/ |title=Memorial Union – Student Organizations |publisher=Asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located on the 3rd floor of the Memorial Union,&lt;ref name=&quot;asu13&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://more.engineering.asu.edu/grad/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/memorial-union.png|title=grad/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/memorial-union|publisher=more.engineering.asu.edu|accessdate=May 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Sun Devil Involvement Center (SDIC) provides opportunities for student involvement through clubs, [[sororities]], [[fraternities]], [[community service]], leadership, [[student government]], and [[Co-curricular activity|co-curricular]] programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asu.edu/tour/tempe/mu.html |title=ASU Tempe Campus Tour: Memorial Union |publisher=Asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changemaker Central is student-run centralized resource hub for student involvement in [[social entrepreneurship]], [[civic engagement]], [[service learning]] and [[community service]] that catalyzes student-driven social change. Changemaker Central locations have opened on all campuses in Fall 2011, providing flexible, creative workspaces for everyone in the ASU community. The project is entirely student run and advances ASU’s institutional commitments to social embeddedness and entrepreneurship. The space allows students to meet, work and join new networks and collaborative enterprises while taking advantage of ASU’s many resources and opportunities for engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changemaker.asu.edu/ |title=Changemaker @ ASU |publisher=Changemaker.asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changemaker Central has signature programs, including Innovation Challenge and 10,000 Solutions, that support students in their journey to become changemakers by creating communities of support around new solutions/ideas and increasing access to early stage seed funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changemaker.asu.edu/about.php#2 |title=Changemaker @ ASU |publisher=Changemaker.asu.edu |date=2011-05-04 |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Innovation Challenge seeks undergraduate and graduate students from across the university who are dedicated to making a difference in our local and global communities through innovation. Students can win up to $10,000 to make their innovative project, prototype, venture or community partnership ideas happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://innovationchallenge.asu.edu/about |title=Overview &amp;#124; ASU Innovation Challenge |publisher=Innovationchallenge.asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 10,000 Solutions Project leverages the power of collaborative imagination and innovation to create a solutions bank. As an experimental problem solving platform, the project showcases and collects ideas at scale with local and global impact. The 10,000 Solutions Project aims to see what can be accomplished when passionate people join a collaborative community that builds upon each other’s innovative ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://10000solutions.org/about |title=About the 10,000 Solutions Project |publisher=10,000 Solutions |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Changemaker Central, the Freshman Year Residential Experience (FYRE) and the [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek]] community (Greek Life) at Arizona State University have been important in binding students to the university, and providing social outlets. The Freshman Year Residential Experience at Arizona State University was developed to improve the freshman experience at Arizona State University and increase student retention figures. FYRE provides advising, computer labs, free walk-in tutoring, workshops, and classes for students. In 2003, ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' ranked FYRE as the 23rd best first year program in the nation. ASU is also home to one of the nation's first and fastest growing gay fraternities, [[Sigma Phi Beta]], founded in 2003;&lt;ref name=&quot;statepress&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statepress.com/2010/11/15/asu-gay-fraternity-expands-to-indiana-university/|title=ASU gay fraternity expands to Indiana University &amp;#124; ASU News &amp;#124; The State Press &amp;#124; Arizona State University|publisher=statepress.com|accessdate=May 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; considered a sign of the growing university's commitment to supporting diversity and inclusion.

The second Eta chapter of [[Phrateres]], a non-exclusive, non-profit social-service club, was installed here in 1958. Between 1924 and 1967, 23 chapters of Phrateres were installed in universities across North America.

===Student media===
''The [[State Press]]'' is a daily paper published on Monday through Friday during the fall and spring semesters, and weekly during the summer sessions. The State Press covers news and events on all four ASU campuses. Student editors and managers are solely responsible for the content of the State Press newspaper and its associated website. These publications are overseen by an independent board and guided by a professional adviser employed by the University.

''The Downtown Devil'' is another student-run newspaper with an associated website for the Downtown Phoenix Campus, produced by students at the [[Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://downtowndevil.com/ |title=Downtown Phoenix News |publisher=Downtown Devil |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ASU has two radio stations. [[KASC (AM)|KASC]] The Blaze 1330&amp;nbsp;AM, is a broadcast station that is owned and funded by the Cronkite School of Journalism, and is completely student-run save for a faculty and professional adviser. The Blaze broadcasts local, alternative and independent music 24 hours a day, and also features news and sports updates at the top and bottom of every hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blazeradioonline.com/ |title=kasc – the blaze 1330 am – asu's original alternative |publisher=Blazeradioonline.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; W7ASU is an [[amateur radio]] station that was first organized in 1935.

In September 2009 criticism over the seven-figure salaries earned by various coaches at Arizona's public universities (including ASU) prompted the Arizona Board of Regents to re-evaluate the salary and benefit policy for athletic staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/sports/ua/articles/2009/09/20/20090920athleticsalaries0919-CP.html ASU, UA Coaching Salaries Reviewed] Arizona Republic, September 20, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; With the 2011 expansion of the [[Pacific-12 Conference]], a new $3&amp;nbsp;billion contract for revenue sharing among all the schools in the conference was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/may/04/sports/la-sp-pac-12-tv-20110505 | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Diane | last=Pucin | title=New Pac-12 TV deal shows the value of sports | date=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the infusion of funds, the salary issue and various athletic department budgeting issues at ASU were addressed.
