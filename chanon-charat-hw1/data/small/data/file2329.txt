'''Richard Buckminster &quot;Bucky&quot; Fuller''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ʊ|l|ər}}; July 12, 1895&amp;nbsp;– July 1, 1983)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/ebc/article-9365050 |title=Fuller, R Buckminster |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |author=Encyclopædia Britannica. |year=2007 |accessdate=April 20, 2007}}{{dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[Neo-Futurism|neo-futuristic]] [[architect]], [[systems theorist]], author, designer, and inventor.

Fuller published more than 30 books, coining or popularizing terms such as &quot;[[Spaceship Earth]]&quot;, [[ephemeralization]], and [[Synergetics (Fuller)|synergetic]]. He also developed numerous inventions, mainly architectural designs, and popularized the widely known [[geodesic dome]]. Carbon molecules known as [[fullerene]]s were later named by scientists for their resemblance to geodesic spheres.

Buckminster Fuller was the second president of [[Mensa International|Mensa]] from 1974 to 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mensa: The Society for the Highly Intelligent |pages=299, 304 |first=Victor |last=Serebriakoff |publisher=Stein and Day |year=1986 |isbn=0-8128-3091-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Fuller was born on July 12, 1895, in [[Milton, Massachusetts]], the son of Richard Buckminster Fuller and Caroline Wolcott Andrews, and also the grandnephew of the [[Transcendentalism|American Transcendentalist]] [[Margaret Fuller]]. He attended [[Friedrich Fröbel|Froebel]]ian Kindergarten.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} Spending much of his youth on Bear Island, in [[Penobscot Bay]] off the coast of Maine, he had trouble with [[geometry]], being unable to understand the abstraction necessary to imagine that a chalk dot on the blackboard represented a mathematical [[Point (geometry)|point]], or that an imperfectly drawn line with an arrow on the end was meant to stretch off to [[infinity]]. He often made items from materials he brought home from the woods, and sometimes made his own tools. He experimented with designing a new apparatus for human propulsion of small boats. By the age of 12 he had &quot;invented&quot; a 'push pull' system for propelling a row boat through the use of an inverted umbrella connected to the transom with a simple oar lock which allowed the user to face forward to point the boat toward its destination. Later in life Fuller took exception to the term &quot;invention&quot;.

Years later, he decided that this sort of experience had provided him with not only an interest in design, but also a habit of being familiar with and knowledgeable about the materials that his later projects would require. Fuller earned a [[machinist|machinist's]] certification, and knew how to use the [[press brake]], stretch press, and other tools and equipment used in the [[sheet metal]] trade.&lt;ref name=pawley&gt;{{cite book |last=Pawley |first=Martin |title=Buckminster Fuller |location=New York |publisher=Taplinger |year=1991 |isbn=0-8008-1116-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Fuller attended [[Milton Academy]] in Massachusetts, and after that began studying at [[Harvard University]], where he was affiliated with [[Adams House (Harvard University)|Adams House]]. He was expelled from Harvard twice: first for spending all his money partying with a [[vaudeville]] troupe, and then, after having been readmitted, for his &quot;irresponsibility and lack of interest.&quot; By his own appraisal, he was a non-conforming misfit in the fraternity environment.&lt;ref name=pawley /&gt;

===Wartime experience===
Between his sessions at Harvard, Fuller worked in Canada as a mechanic in a textile [[factory|mill]], and later as a laborer in the [[meat-packing]] industry. He also served in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] in World War I, as a shipboard radio operator, as an editor of a publication, and as a [[crash rescue boat]] commander. After discharge, he worked again in the meat packing industry, acquiring management experience. In 1917, he married Anne Hewlett. During the early 1920s, he and his father-in-law developed the [[Stockade Building System]] for producing light-weight, weatherproof, and fireproof housing—although the company would ultimately fail&lt;ref name=pawley /&gt; in 1927.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sieden-p84-85&quot;&gt;Lloyd Steven Sieden. ''Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work''. New York: [[Perseus Books Group]], 2000. ISBN 0-7382-0379-3. pp.&amp;nbsp;84–85: &quot;However, in 1927 his own financial difficulties forced Mr. Hewlett to sell his stock in the company. Within weeks Stockade Building Systems became a subsidiary of Celotex Corporation, whose primary motivation was akin to that of other conventional companies: making a profit. Celotex management took one look at Stockade's financial records and called for a complete overhaul of the company. The first casualty of the transition was Stockade's controversial president [Buckminster Fuller, who was fired].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depression and epiphany===
Buckminster Fuller recalled 1927 as a pivotal year of his life. Fuller was still feeling responsible for the death of his daughter Alexandra, who had died in 1922 from complications from [[polio]] and [[spinal meningitis]]&lt;ref&gt;R. Buckminster Fuller, Your Private Sky, Page 27&lt;/ref&gt; just prior to her fourth birthday.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sieden-1989-Buckminster-Fuller's-Universe&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work| first=Lloyd Steven |last=Sieden | publisher=Basic Books | year=1989 | isbn=0-7382-0379-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller felt a personal responsibility for her death, wondering if her death may have been caused by the damp and drafty home which the Fullers had been living in.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sieden-1989-Buckminster-Fuller's-Universe&quot; /&gt; This provided motivation for Fuller's involvement in Stockade Building Systems, a business which aimed to provide affordable, efficient housing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sieden-1989-Buckminster-Fuller's-Universe&quot; /&gt;

In 1927 Fuller, then aged 32, lost his job as president of Stockade. The Fuller family had no savings to fall back upon, and the birth of their daughter Allegra in 1927 added to the financial challenges. Fuller was drinking heavily and reflecting upon the solution to his family's struggles on long walks around Chicago. During the autumn of 1927, Fuller contemplated suicide, so that his family could benefit from a life insurance payment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sieden-p87&quot;&gt;Lloyd Steven Sieden. ''Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work''. New York: [[Basic Books]], 1989. ISBN 0-7382-0379-3. p.&amp;nbsp;87: &quot;...during 1927, Bucky found himself unemployed with a new daughter to support as winter was approaching. With no steady income the Fuller family was living beyond its means and falling further and further into debt. Searching for solace and escape, Bucky continued drinking and carousing. He also tended to wander aimlessly through the Chicago streets pondering his situation. It was during one such walk that he ventured down to the shore of Lake Michigan on a particularly cold autumn evening and seriously contemplated swimming out until he was exhausted and ending his life.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller said that he had experienced a profound incident which would provide direction and purpose for his life. He felt as though he was suspended several feet above the ground enclosed in a white sphere of light. A voice spoke directly to Fuller, and declared:

{{quote|From now on you need never await temporal attestation to your thought. You think the truth. You do not have the right to eliminate yourself. You do not belong to you. You belong to Universe. Your significance will remain forever obscure to you, but you may assume that you are fulfilling your role if you apply yourself to converting your experiences to the highest advantage of others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sieden-p87-88&quot;&gt;Lloyd Steven Sieden. ''Buckminster Fuller's Universe: His Life and Work''. New York: [[Basic Books]], 1989. ISBN 0-7382-0379-3. pp.&amp;nbsp;87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fuller stated that this experience led to a profound re-examination of his life. He ultimately chose to embark on &quot;an experiment, to find what a single individual [could] contribute to changing the world and benefiting all humanity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/automobiles/collectibles/15BUCKY.html?pagewanted=print Design – A Three-Wheel Dream That Died at Takeoff – Buckminster Fuller and the Dymaxion Car – NYTimes.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking to audiences later in life, Fuller would regularly recount the story of his Lake Michigan experience, and its transformative impact on his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sieden-1989-Buckminster-Fuller's-Universe&quot; /&gt; Historians have been unable to identify direct evidence for this experience within the 1927 papers of Fuller's [[Chronofile]] archives, housed at [[Stanford University]]. Stanford historian Barry Katz suggests that the suicide story may be a myth which Fuller constructed later in life, to summarize this formative period of his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;2008-NYTimes-Fuller-Whitney-Museum-of-American-Art&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/15/arts/music/15ster.html?pagewanted=all |title=The Love Song of R.

===Recovery===
In 1927 Fuller resolved to think independently which included a commitment to &quot;the search for the principles governing the universe and help advance the evolution of humanity in accordance with them... finding ways of ''doing more with less'' to the end that all people everywhere can have more and more.&quot;{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} By 1928, Fuller was living in [[Greenwich Village]] and spending much of his time at the popular café [[Romany Marie]]'s,&lt;ref name=&quot;HaberGlueck&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.haberarts.com/fuller.htm |title= Before Buckyballs |author-link= John Haber|first=John |last= Haber|publisher= Review of [[Noguchi Museum]] ''Best of Friends'' exhibit (May 19, 2006 – October 15, 2006) |quote= [[Isamu Noguchi|Noguchi]], then twenty-five, had already had enough influences for a lifetime&amp;nbsp;— from birth in Los Angeles, to childhood in Japan and [[Midwestern United States|the Midwest]], to premedical classes at [[Columbia University|Columbia]], to academic sculpture on the [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]], to [[Brancusi's circle]] in Paris. Now his exposure to [[American Modernism|Modernism and &quot;the American century&quot;]] received a decidedly New York influence.&lt;br/&gt; &quot;Only two years before, on the brink of suicide, Fuller had decided to remake his life and the world. Why not begin on Minetta Street? In 1929, he was shopping around [[Dymaxion house|his first major design]], plans for an inexpensive, modular home that others air-lift right where desired. Now, in exchange for meals, he took on the interior decoration and chairs for Marie's new location. He must have stood out in person, too, ever the talkative, handsome visionary in tie and starched collar.&quot; &lt;br/&gt; See also: {{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/19/arts/design/19nogu.html |title= The Architect and the Sculptor: A Friendship of Ideas |publisher= [[Grace Glueck]], ''[[The New York Times]]'' |date= May 19, 2006 | accessdate=April 27, 2010}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he had spent an evening in conversation with Marie and [[Eugene O'Neill]] several years earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sieden-p74&quot;&gt;Lloyd Steven Sieden.

ISBN 0-7382-0379-3. p.&amp;nbsp;74: &quot;Although O'Neill soon became well known as a major American playwright, it was Romany Marie who would significantly influence Bucky, becoming his close friend and confidante during the most difficult years of his life.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller accepted a job decorating the interior of the café in exchange for meals,&lt;ref name=&quot;HaberGlueck&quot;/&gt; giving informal lectures several times a week,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sieden-p74&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Haskell&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kgbbar.com/lit/features/buckminster_ful.html |title= Buckminster Fuller and Isamu Noguchi |first= John |last=Haskell |work= Kraine Gallery Bar Lit, Fall 2007 |accessdate= 2014-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and models of the [[Dymaxion house]] were exhibited at the café.

===Geodesic domes===
Fuller taught at [[Black Mountain College]] in [[North Carolina]] during the summers of 1948 and 1949,&lt;ref name=&quot;ExhibitBMC&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blackmountaincollege.org/content/view/45/60/ |title= IDEAS + INVENTIONS: Buckminster Fuller and Black Mountain College |work= Black Mountain College Museum and Arts Center Exhibit |date= July 15 – November 26, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; serving as its Summer Institute director in 1949. There, with the support of a group of professors and students, he began reinventing a project that would make him famous: the [[geodesic dome]]. Although the geodesic dome had been created some 30 years earlier by Dr. [[Walther Bauersfeld]], Fuller was awarded United States patents. He is credited for popularizing this type of structure.

One of his early models was first constructed in 1945 at [[Bennington College]] in Vermont, where he frequently lectured. In 1949, he erected his first geodesic dome building that could sustain its own weight with no practical limits. It was {{convert|4.3|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} in diameter and constructed of aluminum aircraft tubing and a vinyl-plastic skin, in the form of an [[icosahedron]]. To prove his design, and to awe non-believers, Fuller suspended from the structure's framework several students who had helped him build it. The U.S. government recognized the importance of his work, and employed his firm Geodesics, Inc. in Raleigh, North Carolina to make small domes for the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]]. Within a few years there were thousands of these domes around the world.

Fuller began working with architect [[Shoji Sadao]] in 1954, and in 1964 they co-founded the architectural firm Fuller &amp; Sadao Inc., whose first project was to design the large [[geodesic dome]] for the [[Montreal Biosphere|U.S. Pavilion]] at [[Expo 67]] in [[Montreal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wrsc.org&quot;&gt;http://www.wrsc.org/people/shoji-sadao&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller's first &quot;continuous tension – discontinuous compression&quot; geodesic dome (full sphere in this case) was constructed at the University of Oregon Architecture School in 1959 with the help of students.&lt;ref&gt;''The Dymaxion World of Buckminster Fuller''. ISBN 0-385-01804-5.&lt;/ref&gt; These continuous tension – discontinuous compression structures featured single force compression members (no flexure or bending moments) that did not touch each other and were 'suspended' by the tensional members.

===Best-known work===
For the next half-century, Fuller developed many ideas, designs and inventions, particularly regarding practical, inexpensive shelter and transportation. He documented his life, philosophy and ideas scrupulously by a daily [[diary]] (later called the ''[[Dymaxion Chronofile]]''), and by twenty-eight publications. Fuller financed some of his experiments with inherited funds, sometimes augmented by funds invested by his collaborators, one example being the [[Dymaxion car]] project.

===World stage===
[[File:Biosphère Montréal.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Montreal Biosphère]] by Buckminster Fuller, 1967]]
International recognition began with the success of huge [[geodesic dome]]s during the 1950s. Fuller lectured at [[NC State University]] in Raleigh in 1949, where he met James Fitzgibbon, who would become a close friend and colleague. Fitzgibbon was director of Geodesics, Inc. and Synergetics, Inc. the first licensees to design geodesic domes. Thomas C. Howard was lead designer, architect and engineer for both companies. In 1964 Fuller co-founded the architectural firm Fuller &amp; Sadao Inc., with [[Shoji Sadao]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wrsc.org&quot;/&gt; From 1959 to 1970, Fuller taught at [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale]] (SIU). Beginning as an assistant professor, he gained full professorship in 1968, in the School of Art and Design. Working as a designer, scientist, developer, and writer, he lectured for many years around the world. He collaborated at SIU with the designer [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]]. In 1965, Fuller inaugurated the World Design Science Decade (1965 to 1975) at the meeting of the [[International Union of Architects]] in Paris, which was, in his own words, devoted to &quot;applying the principles of science to solving the problems of humanity.&quot; Later in his SIU tenure, Fuller was also a visiting professor at [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville|SIU Edwardsville]], where he designed the dome for the campus Religious Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siue.edu/maps/tour/center-spirituality-sustainability.shtml |title=The Center for Spirituality &amp; Sustainability |publisher=Siue.edu |date= |accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller believed human societies would soon rely mainly on renewable sources of energy, such as solar- and wind-derived electricity. He hoped for an age of &quot;omni-successful education and sustenance of all humanity.&quot; Fuller referred to himself as &quot;the property of universe&quot; and during one radio interview he gave later in life, declared himself and his work &quot;the property of all humanity&quot;. For his lifetime of work, the [[American Humanist Association]] named him the 1969 Humanist of the Year.

In 1976, Fuller was a key participant at [[UN Habitat I]], the first UN forum on human settlements.

===Honors===
Fuller was awarded 28 United States patents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?as_drrb_ap=q&amp;as_minm_ap=1&amp;as_miny_ap=2007&amp;as_maxm_ap=1&amp;as_maxy_ap=2007&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=1&amp;as_miny_is=2007&amp;as_maxm_is=1&amp;as_maxy_is=2007&amp;q=%22inventor%3A+richard+buckminster+fuller%22&amp;btnG=Search+Patents |title=Partial list of Fuller U.S. patents |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many honorary doctorates. In 1960, he was awarded the [[The Franklin Institute Awards|Frank P. Brown Medal]] from [[The Franklin Institute]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter F|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterF.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=April 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 he was elected into the [[National Academy of Design]] as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1970. In 1970 he received the [[AIA Gold Medal|Gold Medal]] award from the [[American Institute of Architects]]. He also received numerous other awards, including the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] presented to him on February 23, 1983 by President [[Ronald Reagan]].

===Last filmed appearance===
Fuller's last filmed interview took place on April 3, 1983, in which he presented his analysis of [[Simon Rodia]]'s [[Watts Towers]] as a unique embodiment of the structural principles found in nature. Portions of this interview appear in ''[[I Build the Tower]],'' a documentary film on Rodia's architectural masterpiece.

===Death===
[[File:Bucky TRIMTAB.jpg|thumb|right|Gravestone (see [[Trim tab#Trim tab as a metaphor|trim tab]])]]
Fuller died on July 1, 1983, 11 days before his 88th birthday. During the period leading up to his death, his wife had been lying comatose in a Los Angeles hospital&lt;!-- What was the name of this hospital? --&gt;, dying of cancer. It was while visiting her there that he exclaimed, at a certain point: &quot;She is squeezing my hand!&quot; He then stood up, suffered a heart attack, and died an hour later, at age 87. His wife of 66 years died 36 hours later. They are buried in [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

==Philosophy and worldview==
The grandson of [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister [[Arthur Buckminster Fuller]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/arthurbuckminsterfuller.html Arthur Buckminster Fuller]{{dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; R. Buckminster Fuller was also Unitarian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/unitarians/fuller.html Buckminster Fuller: Designer of a New World]{{dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buckminster Fuller was an early [[environmental activist]]. He was very aware of the finite resources the planet has to offer, and promoted a principle that he termed &quot;[[ephemeralization]]&quot;, which, in essence—according to futurist and Fuller disciple [[Stewart Brand]]—Fuller coined to mean &quot;doing more with less&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brand |first=Stewart |title=The Clock of the Long Now |location=New York |publisher=Basic |year=1999 |isbn=0-465-04512-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resources and waste material from cruder products could be recycled into making more valuable products, increasing the efficiency of the entire process. Fuller also introduced [[Synergetics (Fuller)|synergetics]], an encompassing term which he used broadly as a metaphoric language for communicating experiences using geometric concepts and, more specifically, to reference the empirical study of systems in transformation, with an emphasis on total system behavior unpredicted by the behavior of any isolated components. Fuller coined this term long before the term [[synergy]] became popular.

Fuller was a pioneer in thinking globally, and he explored principles of [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy]] and [[material efficiency]] in the fields of architecture, engineering and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fuller |first=R. Buckminster |title=[[Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth]] |location=Carbondale, IL |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |year=1969 |isbn=0-8093-2461-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fuller |first=R.

J. |title=Synergetics |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan |year=1975 |isbn=0-02-541870-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; He cited François de Chardenedes' opinion that petroleum, from the standpoint of its replacement cost out of our current energy &quot;budget&quot; (essentially, the net incoming [[solar energy|solar flux]]), had cost nature &quot;over a million dollars&quot; per U.S. gallon (US$300,000 per litre) to produce. From this point of view, its use as a transportation fuel by people commuting to work represents a huge net loss compared to their earnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fuller |first=R.

Fuller was concerned about [[sustainability]] and about human survival under the existing socio-economic system, yet remained optimistic about humanity's future. Defining wealth in terms of knowledge, as the &quot;technological ability to protect, nurture, support, and accommodate all growth needs of life,&quot; his analysis of the condition of &quot;Spaceship Earth&quot; caused him to conclude that at a certain time during the 1970s, humanity had attained an unprecedented state. He was convinced that the accumulation of relevant knowledge, combined with the quantities of major recyclable resources that had already been extracted from the earth, had attained a critical level, such that competition for necessities was not necessary anymore. Cooperation had become the optimum survival strategy. &quot;Selfishness,&quot; he declared, &quot;is unnecessary and hence-forth unrationalizable.... War is obsolete.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fuller |first= R. Buckminster |pages= xxv |chapter= Introduction |title= Critical Path |edition= First |year= 1981 |location= New York, N.Y. |publisher= St.Martin's Press |isbn= 0-312-17488-8|quote= &quot;It no longer has to be you or me. Selfishness is unnecessary and hence-forth unrationalizable as mandated by survival. War is obsolete. |nopp= true}}&lt;/ref&gt; He criticized previous utopian schemes as too exclusive, and thought this was a major source of their failure. To work, he thought that a utopia needed to include everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Utopia or oblivion: the prospects for humanity|last=Fuller|first=R.

So it is not surprising that he and others of his stature were attracted by [[Korzybski]]'s ideas in ''[[general semantics]]''. General semantics is a discipline of mind that seeks to unify persons and nations by changing their worldview reaction and the philosophy of their expression. In the 1950s Fuller attended seminars and workshops organized by the [[Institute of General Semantics]], and he delivered the annual [[Alfred Korzybski Memorial Lecture]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notable Individuals Influenced by General Semantics|url=http://www.generalsemantics.org/the-general-semantics-learning-center/overview-of-general-semantics/notable-individuals/|publisher=The Institute of General Semantics|accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Korzybski is mentioned in the Introduction of his book ''[[Synergetics (Fuller)|Synergetics]]''.

In his 1970 book ''I Seem To Be a Verb'', he wrote: &quot;I live on Earth at present, and I don't know what I am. I know that I am not a category. I am not a thing—a noun. I seem to be a verb, an evolutionary process—an integral function of the universe.&quot;

Fuller wrote that the natural [[analytic geometry]] of the universe was based on arrays of tetrahedra. He developed this in several ways, from the close-packing of spheres and the number of compressive or tensile members required to stabilize an object in space. One confirming result was that the strongest possible homogeneous [[truss]] is cyclically tetrahedral.&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, Amy, &quot;A Fuller Explanation&quot;, Birkhauser, Boston, 1987, p19 tetrahedra, p110 octet truss&lt;/ref&gt;

He had become a [[guru]] of the design, architecture, and 'alternative' communities, such as [[Drop City]], the community of experimental artists to whom he awarded the 1966 &quot;Dymaxion Award&quot; for &quot;poetically economic&quot; domed living structures.

==Major design projects==
[[File:Géode V 3 1.gif|frame|A geodesic sphere]]

===The geodesic dome===
Fuller was most famous for his [[thin-shell structure|lattice shell structures]] – [[geodesic dome]]s, which have been used as parts of military radar stations, civic buildings, environmental protest camps and exhibition attractions. An examination of the geodesic design by [[Walther Bauersfeld]] for the [[Planetarium Jena|Zeiss-Planetarium]], built some 20 years prior to Fuller's work, reveals that Fuller's Geodesic Dome patent (U.S. 2,682,235; awarded in 1954), follows the same design as Bauersfeld's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telacommunications.com/geodome.htm |title=Geodesic Domes and Charts of the Heavens |publisher=Telacommunications.com |date=1973-06-19 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their construction is based on extending some basic principles to build simple &quot;[[tensegrity]]&quot; structures (tetrahedron, [[octahedron]], and the closest packing of spheres), making them lightweight and stable. The geodesic dome was a result of Fuller's exploration of nature's constructing principles to find design solutions. The Fuller Dome is referenced in the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novel ''[[Stand on Zanzibar]]'' by [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], in which a geodesic dome is said to cover the entire island of [[Manhattan]], and it floats on air due to the hot-air balloon effect of the large air-mass under the dome (and perhaps its construction of lightweight materials).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjfearnley.com/fuller-faq-4.html#ss4.1 |title=The R. Buckminster Fuller FAQ: Geodesic Domes |publisher=Cjfearnley.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transportation===
In the 1930s, Fuller designed and built prototypes of what he hoped would be a safer, aerodynamic car, which he called the [[Dymaxion car|Dymaxion]]. (&quot;Dymaxion&quot; is said to be a [[syllabic abbreviation]] of ''dynamic maximum tension'', or possibly of ''dynamic maximum ion''.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080227075757/http://www.automuseum.org/NAM_collections_dymaxion2.shtml | url =  http://www.automuseum.org/NAM_collections_dymaxion2.shtml |  title=National Automobile Museum – collections | archivedate=February 27, 2008 |accessdate=September 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller worked with professional colleagues for three years beginning in 1932 on a design idea Fuller had derived from aircraft technologies. The three prototype cars were different from anything being sold at the time. They had three wheels: two front drive wheels and one rear, steered wheel. The engine was in the rear, and the chassis and body were original designs. The [[aerodynamic]], somewhat tear-shaped body was large enough to seat eleven people and was about {{convert|18|ft|m}} long, resembling a blend of a light aircraft (without wings) and a [[Volkswagen]] van of 1950s vintage. All three prototypes were essentially a mini-bus, and its concept long predated the [[Volkswagen Type 2]] mini-bus conceived in 1947 by [[Ben Pon (senior)|Ben Pon]].[[Image:Dynamaxion 1933.jpg|thumb|[[Dymaxion car]]]]

Despite its length, and due to its three-wheel design, the Dymaxion turned on a small [[turning radius|radius]] and could easily be parked in a tight space. The prototypes were efficient in fuel consumption for their day, traveling about 30 miles per gallon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=54863|title=Stanford Magazine – 'I seem to be a verb...' – July/August 2012| accessdate=September 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller contributed a great deal of his own money to the project, in addition to funds from one of his professional collaborators. An industrial investor was also very interested in the concept. Fuller anticipated that the cars could travel on an open highway safely at up to about {{convert|160|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, but, in practice, they were difficult to control and steer above {{convert|80|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. Investors backed out and research ended after one of the prototypes was involved in a high-profile collision that resulted in a fatality. In 2007, ''[[Time Magazine]]'' reported on the Dymaxion as one of the &quot;50 worst cars of all time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/article/0,28804,1658545_1657686_1657677,00.html |title=The 50 Worst Cars of All Time |publisher=Time.com |date=2007-09-07 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, industrialist [[Henry J. Kaiser]] asked Fuller to develop a prototype for a smaller car, but Fuller's five-seater design was never developed further.

===Housing===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
[[File:Dymaxion house.jpg|thumb|right|A Dymaxion house at [[The Henry Ford]]]]
Fuller's energy-efficient and inexpensive [[Dymaxion house]] garnered much interest, but has never been produced. Here the term &quot;Dymaxion&quot; is used in effect to signify a &quot;radically strong and light tensegrity structure&quot;. One of Fuller's Dymaxion Houses is on display as a permanent exhibit at The Henry Ford in [[Dearborn, Michigan]]. Designed and developed during the mid-1940s, this prototype is a round structure (not a dome), shaped something like the flattened &quot;bell&quot; of certain jellyfish. It has several innovative features, including revolving dresser drawers, and a fine-mist shower that reduces water consumption. According to Fuller biographer Steve Crooks, the house was designed to be delivered in two cylindrical packages, with interior color panels available at local dealers. A circular structure at the top of the house was designed to rotate around a central mast to use natural winds for cooling and air circulation.

Conceived nearly two decades before, and developed in [[Wichita, Kansas]], the house was designed to be lightweight and adapted to windy climates. It was to be inexpensive to produce and purchase, and assembled easily. It was to be produced using factories, workers, and technologies that had produced World War II aircraft. It was ultramodern-looking at the time, built of metal, and sheathed in polished aluminum. The basic model enclosed {{convert|90|m2|ft2|abbr=on}} of floor area. Due to publicity, there were many orders during the early Post-War years, but the company that Fuller and others had formed to produce the houses failed due to management problems.

In 1969, Fuller began the Otisco Project, named after its location in [[Otisco, New York]]. The project developed and demonstrated concrete spray technology used in conjunction with mesh covered wireforms as a viable means of producing large scale, load bearing spanning structures built on site without the use of pouring molds, other adjacent surfaces or hoisting.

The initial construction method used a circular concrete footing in which anchor posts were set. Tubes cut to length and with ends flattened were then bolted together to form a duodeca-rhombicahedron (22-sided hemisphere) geodesic structure with spans ranging to {{convert|60|ft|m}}. The form was then draped with layers of ¼-inch wire mesh attached by twist ties. Concrete was then sprayed onto the structure, building up a solid layer which, when cured, would support additional concrete to be added by a variety of traditional means. Fuller referred to these buildings as monolithic ferroconcrete geodesic domes. The tubular frame form proved too problematic when it came to setting windows and doors, and was abandoned. The second method used iron [[rebar]] set vertically in the concrete footing and then bent inward and welded in place to create the dome's wireform structure and performed satisfactorily. Domes up to three stories tall built with this method proved to be remarkably strong. Other shapes such as cones, pyramids and arches proved equally adaptable.

The project was enabled by a grant underwritten by [[Syracuse University]] and sponsored by [[US Steel]] (rebar), the Johnson Wire Corp, (mesh) and Portland Cement Company (concrete). The ability to build large complex load bearing concrete spanning structures in free space would open many possibilities in architecture, and is considered as one of Fuller's greatest contributions.

===Dymaxion map and World Game===
Fuller also designed an alternative projection map, called the [[Dymaxion map]]. This was designed to show Earth's continents with minimum distortion when projected or printed on a flat surface. In the 1960s, Fuller developed the [[World Game]], a collaborative simulation game played on a 70-by-35-foot Dymaxion map,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perry|first=Tony|title=This Game Anything but Child's Play: Buckminster Fuller's creation aims to fight the real enemies of mankind: starvation, disease and illiteracy|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-10-02/local/me-52516_1_buckminster-fuller|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=19 January 2014|date=October 2, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which players attempt to solve world problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Richards|first=Allen|title=R.

==Quirks==
Fuller was a frequent flier, often crossing time zones. He famously wore three watches; one for the current zone, one for the zone he had departed, and one for the zone he was going to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kolbert |first=Elizabeth |url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/06/09/080609fa_fact_kolbert?currentPage=all |title=Annals of Innovation: Dymaxion Man: Reporting &amp; Essays |publisher=The New Yorker |date= |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Fuller |first = Buckminster |title = [[Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth]] |publisher = Southern Illinois University Press |location = Carbondale |year = 1969 |isbn = 0-8093-2461-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller also noted that a single sheet of newsprint, inserted over a shirt and under a suit jacket, provided completely effective [[heat insulation]] during long flights.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

He experimented with [[polyphasic sleep]], which he called Dymaxion sleep. In 1943, he told ''Time Magazine'' that he had slept only two hours a day for two years. He quit the schedule because it conflicted with his business associates' sleep habits, but stated that Dymaxion sleep could help the United States win World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,774680,00.html | work=Time | title=Science: Dymaxion Sleep | date=October 11, 1943 | accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller documented his life copiously from 1915 to 1983, approximately {{convert|270|ft|m}} of papers in a collection called the Dymaxion Chronofile. He also kept copies of all incoming and outgoing correspondence. The enormous Fuller Collection is currently housed at [[Stanford]] University.

I must put everything in, so I started a very rigorous record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2003/january22/bucky-122.html |title=Buckminster Fuller conversations |publisher=News-service.stanford.edu |date=2003-01-22 |accessdate=2014-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-sul.stanford.edu//depts/spc/fuller/about.html |title=Stanford University Libraries &amp; Academic Information Resources: |publisher=Sul.stanford.edu |date=June 22, 2005 |accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his youth, Fuller experimented with several ways of presenting himself: R. B. Fuller, Buckminster Fuller, but as an adult finally settled on R. Buckminster Fuller, and signed his letters as such. However, he preferred to be addressed as simply &quot;Bucky&quot;.

==Language and neologisms==
Buckminster Fuller spoke and wrote in a unique style and said it was important to describe the world as accurately as possible.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;What is important in this connection is the way in which humans reflex spontaneously for that is the way in which they usually behave in critical moments, and it is often &quot;common sense&quot; to reflex in perversely ignorant ways that produce social disasters by denying knowledge and ignorantly yielding to common sense.&quot; Intuition, 1972 Doubleday, New York. p.103&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller often created long run-on sentences and used unusual compound words (omniwell-informed, intertransformative, omni-interaccommodative, omniself-regenerative) as well as terms he himself invented.&lt;ref&gt;He wrote a single unpunctuated sentence approximately 3000 words long titled &quot;What I Am Trying to Do.&quot; And It Came to Pass – Not to Stay Macmillan Publishing, New York, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller used the word ''Universe'' without the [[definite article|definite]] or [[indefinite article]]s (''the'' or ''a'') and always capitalized the word. Fuller wrote that &quot;by Universe I mean: the aggregate of all humanity's consciously apprehended and communicated (to self or others) Experiences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;How Little I Know&quot; from And It Came to Pass – Not to Stay Macmillan, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

The words &quot;down&quot; and &quot;up&quot;, according to Fuller, are awkward in that they refer to a planar concept of direction inconsistent with human experience. The words &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot; should be used instead, he argued, because they better describe an object's relation to a gravitational center, the Earth. &quot;I suggest to audiences that they say, 'I'm going &quot;outstairs&quot; and &quot;instairs.&quot;' At first that sounds strange to them; They all laugh about it. But if they try saying in and out for a few days in fun, they find themselves beginning to realize that they are indeed going inward and outward in respect to the center of Earth, which is our Spaceship Earth. And for the first time they begin to feel real 'reality.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Intuition'' (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;World-around&quot; is a term coined by Fuller to replace &quot;worldwide&quot;. The general belief in a [[flat Earth]] died out in [[classical antiquity]], so using &quot;wide&quot; is an anachronism when referring to the surface of the Earth—a spheroidal surface has area and encloses a volume but has no width. Fuller held that unthinking use of obsolete scientific ideas detracts from and misleads intuition. Other neologisms collectively invented by the Fuller family, according to Allegra Fuller Snyder, are the terms &quot;sunsight&quot; and &quot;sunclipse&quot;, replacing &quot;sunrise&quot; and &quot;sunset&quot; to overturn the geocentric bias of most pre-[[Nicolaus Copernicus|copernican]] [[celestial mechanics]].

Fuller also invented the word &quot;livingry,&quot; as opposed to weaponry (or &quot;killingry&quot;), to mean that which is in support of all human, plant, and Earth life. &quot;The architectural profession—civil, naval, aeronautical, and astronautical—has always been the place where the most competent thinking is conducted regarding livingry, as opposed to weaponry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Critical Path'', page xxv.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as contributing significantly to the development of tensegrity technology, Fuller invented the term &quot;[[tensegrity]]&quot; from ''tensional integrity''. &quot;Tensegrity describes a structural-relationship principle in which structural shape is guaranteed by the finitely closed, comprehensively continuous, tensional behaviors of the system and not by the discontinuous and exclusively local compressional member behaviors. Tensegrity provides the ability to yield increasingly without ultimately breaking or coming asunder.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Synergetics'', page 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;[[Dymaxion]]&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;dynamic maximum tension&quot;. It was invented about 1929 by two [[Advertising agency|admen]] at Marshall Field's department store in Chicago to describe Fuller's concept house, which was shown as part of a house of the future store display. They created the term utilizing three words that Fuller used repeatedly to describe his design – dynamic, maximum, and ion.&lt;ref&gt;''R. Buckminster Fuller – Autobiographical Monologue/Scenario'',St. Martin’s Press, Inc.,1980, page 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller also helped to popularize the concept of [[Spaceship Earth]]: &quot;The most important fact about Spaceship Earth: an instruction manual didn't come with it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cjfearnley_com-fortunes_srchstr_Fuller&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Selected Quotes|url=http://www.cjfearnley.com/cgi-bin/cjf-fortunes.pl?srchstr=Fuller&amp;name=Submit}} 090810 cjfearnley.com&lt;/ref&gt;
