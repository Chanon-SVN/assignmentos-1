== Biography==
As the son of [[Neoptolemus I of Epirus|Neoptolemus I]] and brother of [[Olympias]], Alexander I was an uncle of [[Alexander the Great]]. He was also an uncle of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]]. He was brought at an early age to the court of [[Philip II of Macedon]], and after the Grecian fashion became the object of his attachment. At the age of about 20, Philip made him king of Epirus, after dethroning his uncle [[Arymbas]].&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Junianus Justinus (Justin): Epitome of the Philippic History of Pompeius Trogus Book VIII, Chapter 6. Online translation http://www.forumromanum.org/literature/justin/english/trans8.html&lt;/ref&gt;

When Olympias was repudiated by her husband, 337&amp;nbsp;BC, she went to her brother, and endeavoured to induce him to make war on Philip.

Alexander, however, declined the contest, and formed a second alliance with Philip by taking to wife the daughter of Philip (Alexander I's niece) [[Cleopatra of Macedonia|Cleopatra]] in marriage (336&amp;nbsp;BC). At the wedding Philip was assassinated by [[Pausanias of Orestis]].

In 334&amp;nbsp;BC, Alexander I, at the request of the Greek colony of [[Taranto|Taras]] (in [[Magna Graecia]]), crossed over into [[Italy]], to aid them in battle against several [[Ancient Italic peoples|Italic tribes]], the [[Lucanians]] and [[Bruttii]]. After a victory over the [[Samnium|Samnites]] and Lucanians near [[Paestum]], 332&amp;nbsp;BC, he made a treaty with the [[Roman Republic|Romans]]. Success still followed his arms. He took [[Heraclea (Lucania)|Heraclea]] from the Lucanians, and [[Terina]] and Sipontum from the Bruttii. Through the treachery of some Lucanian exiles, he was compelled to engage under unfavourable circumstances in the [[battle of Pandosia]] and was killed by a Lucanian. He left a son, [[Neoptolemus II of Epirus|Neoptolemus]], and a daughter, Cadmea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Junianus Justinus|Justin]]. ''Epitome of Pompeius Trogus'', viii.6, ix.6, xii.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]]. ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]]'', viii.3, 17, 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Aulus Gellius]]. ''Noctes Atticae'', xvii.21&lt;/ref&gt;

In a famous passage&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0026%3Abook%3D9%3Achapter%3D19 Livy 9.19, Alternative history: Alexander the Great vs. Rome]&lt;/ref&gt; that is often considered the first specimen of [[Counterfactual history|alternative history]], [[Livy]] speculates on what would have been the outcome of a military showdown between [[Alexander the Great]] and the [[Roman Republic]]. He reports there that as Alexander of Epirus lay mortally wounded on the battlefield at Pandosia he compared his fortunes to those of his famous nephew and said that the latter &quot;waged war against women&quot;.
