==Origin and medieval usage==
{{anchor|Etymology}}
{{wiktionary}}
The word is from [[Anglo-Norman]] ''bacheler'' (later [[suffix]]al change to ''bachelier''; cf. ''escolier'' &quot;student&quot;, from earlier ''escoler''), a young [[squire]] in training. The ultimate source of the word is uncertain, it may be from [[Medieval Latin]] ''baccalari(u)s'' &quot;vassal farmer&quot; or &quot;farm hand&quot; (cf. [[Occitan language|Provençal]] ''bacalar'', Tuscan ''bacalaro'' &quot;squire&quot;), i.e. one who tends a ''baccalaria'', a term for a grazing farm (from ''bacca'' &quot;[[cow]]&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;Middle Latin meanings:  [[Du Cange]] (1733),  [http://books.google.ch/books?id=no9IWJhHTxIC&amp;pg=PA153-IA67#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 906–912].
&lt;/ref&gt; or it may be from Latin ''baculum'' &quot;a stick&quot; (as the knight-in-training would practice with a wooden club before receiving his sword).&lt;ref&gt;etymological discussion, with references:
Uwe Friedrich Schmidt, ''Praeromanica Der Italoromania Auf Der Grundlage Des LEI (A und B)'', Europäische Hochschulschriften 49, 9:  Italienische Sprache und Literatur, Peter Lang, 2009, [http://books.google.ch/books?id=6OPrKYUOFvgC&amp;pg=PA117 117–120].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old French term crossed into English around 1300, referring to one belonging to the lowest stage of [[knighthood]]. [[Knights bachelor]] were either poor vassals who could not afford to take the field under their own banner, or knights too young to support the responsibility and dignity of [[knights banneret]].

From the 14th century, the term was also used for a junior member of a [[guild]] (otherwise known as &quot;yeomen&quot;) or [[university]]; hence, an ecclesiastic of an inferior grade, for example, a young [[monk]] or even recently appointed [[Canon (priest)|canon]];&lt;ref&gt;Severtius, de episcopis Lugdunen-sibus, p.&amp;nbsp;377, in [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange|du Cange]].&lt;/ref&gt; and also an inferior grade in [[scholarship]], i.e. one holding a &quot;[[bachelor's degree]]&quot; In this sense the word ''baccalarius'' or ''baccalaureus'' first appears at the [[University of Paris]] in the 13th century, in the system of degrees established under the auspices of [[Pope Gregory IX]], as applied to scholars still in ''statu pupillari''. 
Thus there were two classes of baccalarii: the ''baccalarii cursores'', theological candidates passed for admission to the divinity course; and the ''baccalarii dispositi'', who, having completed this course, were entitled to proceed to the higher degrees.

==Use for &quot;unmarried man&quot; in the 19th and 20th centuries==

{{mergefrom|Eligible bachelor|date=April 2013}}

In the [[Victorian era]], the term [[eligible bachelor]] was used in the context of [[upper class]] [[arranged marriage|matchmaking]], denoting a young man who was not only unmarried and eligible for marriage, but also considered &quot;eligible&quot; in financial and societal terms for the prospective bride under discussion. Also in the Victorian era, the term &quot;confirmed bachelor&quot; denoted a man who was resolute to remain unmarried.

By the later 19th century, the term &quot;bachelor&quot; had acquired the general sense of &quot;unmarried man&quot;. The expression [[bachelor party]] is recorded 1882. In 1895, a feminine equivalent &quot;bachelor-girl&quot; was coined, replaced in US English by the somewhat humorous &quot;[[bachelorette]]&quot; by the mid-1930s. After [[World War II]], this terminology came to be seen as antiquated, and has been mostly replaced by the gender-neutral term &quot;[[single person|single]]&quot; (first recorded 1964). In England and Wales, the term &quot;bachelor&quot; remained the official term used for the purpose of marriage registration until 2005, when it was abolished in favour of &quot;single.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=R.I.P Bachelors and Spinsters|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4141996.stm|accessdate=8 April 2013|newspaper=BBC|date=14 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf|Gulf Arab]] countries, &quot;bachelor&quot; can refer to men who are single as well as immigrant men married to a spouse residing in their country of origin (due to the high added cost of sponsoring a spouse onsite),&lt;ref&gt;http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/general/hundreds-of-bachelors-crammed-in-squalid-and-dilapidated-buildings-1.194725&lt;/ref&gt; and a colloquial term &quot;executive bachelor&quot; is also used in rental and sharing accommodation advertisements to indicate availability to [[white-collar worker|white-collar]] bachelors in particular.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/search?q=executive-bachelor&lt;/ref&gt;
