'''Adelaide of Italy''' (931 – 16 December 999), also called '''Adelaide of Burgundy''', was the second wife of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Otto the Great]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ce&quot;&gt;Campbell, Thomas. &quot;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01140c.htm St. Adelaide.]&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 20 Sept. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and was crowned as the [[List of Holy Roman Empresses|Holy Roman Empress]] with him by [[Pope John XII]] in [[Rome]] on February 2, 962. She was the daughter-in-law of [[Matilda of Ringelheim|St. Queen Matilda of East Francia]]. Empress Adelaide was perhaps the most prominent European woman of the 10th century; she was regent of the Holy Roman Empire as the guardian of her grandson in 991-995.&lt;ref name=&quot;ce&quot;/&gt;

==Life==
Born in [[Orbe]], today in [[Switzerland]], she was the daughter of [[Rudolf II of Burgundy]], a member of the [[Elder House of Welf]], and [[Bertha of Swabia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Appendix'', '''The New Cambridge Medieval History: Volume 3, C.900-c.1024''', ed. Timothy Reuter, Rosamond McKitterick, (Cambridge University Press, 1999), 699.&lt;/ref&gt; Her first marriage, at the age of fifteen, was to the son of her father's rival in Italy, [[Lothair II of Italy|Lothair II]], the nominal [[King of Italy]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallick 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gallick|first=Sarah|title=The big book of women saints|year=2009|publisher=HarperCollins e-books|location=Pymble, NSW|isbn=0061956562}}&lt;/ref&gt; the union was part of a political settlement designed to conclude a peace between her father and [[Hugh of Provence]], the father of Lothair. They had a daughter, [[Emma of Italy]].

===Marriage to Otto I===
[[Image:Meissner-dom-stifter.jpg|thumb|left|Adelaide and her second spouse Otto&amp;nbsp;I the Great]]
The [[Calendar of Saints]] states that her first husband was poisoned by the holder of real power, his successor, [[Berengar of Ivrea]], who attempted to cement his political power by forcing her to marry his son, [[Adalbert of Ivrea|Adalbert]]; when she refused and fled, she was tracked down and imprisoned for four months at [[Como]].

According to Adelheid's contemporary biographer, [[Odilo of Cluny]], she managed to escape from captivity. After a time spent in the marshes nearby, she was rescued and taken to a &quot;certain impregnable fortress,&quot; likely the fortified town of [[Canossa]] near [[Reggio nell'Emilia|Reggio]].&lt;ref&gt;Odilo of Cluny, ''Epitaph of Adelheid'' ch. 3, in Gilsdorf, ''Queenship and Sanctity'', 131&lt;/ref&gt; She managed to send an emissary to throw herself on the mercy of [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto the Great]]. His brothers were equally willing to save the dowager queen, but Otto got an army into the field. The widow met her rescuer at the old [[Lombards|Lombard]] capital of [[Pavia]] and they married in 951.&lt;ref&gt;''Burgundy and Provence, 879–1032'', Constance Brittain Bouchard,'''The New Cambridge Medieval History: Volume 3, C.900-c.1024''', 342.&lt;/ref&gt; They had four children, as discussed below. [[Pope John&amp;nbsp;XII]] crowned Otto [[Holy Roman Emperor]] in [[Rome]] on February 2, 962, and, breaking tradition, also crowned Adelaide as [[List of Holy Roman Empresses|Holy Roman Empress]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Ottonians as kings and emperors'', Eckhard Müller-Mertens, '''The New Cambridge Medieval History: Volume 3, C.900-c.1024''', 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, the crushing of a revolt in 953 by [[Liudolf, Duke of Swabia|Liudolf]], Otto's son by his first marriage, cemented Adelheid's position, for she retained all her dower lands. She and their eleven-year old son, the crown prince who became [[Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto&amp;nbsp;II]], accompanied Otto in 966 on his third expedition to Italy, where Otto restored the newly elected [[Pope John XIII]] to his throne (and executed some of the Roman rioters who had deposed him). Adelheid remained in Rome for six years while Otto ruled his kingdom from Italy. Their son Otto II was crowned co-emperor in 967, then married the Byzantine princess [[Theophanu]] in April 972, resolving the conflict between the two empires in southern Italy, as well as ensuring the imperial succession. Adelheid and her husband then returned to Germany, where Otto died in May 973, at the same [[Memleben]] palace where his father had died 37 years earlier.

===Retirement===
Adelaide had long entertained close relations with [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]], then the center of the movement for ecclesiastical reform, and in particular with its abbots [[Majolus]] and [[Odilo of Cluny|Odilo]]. She retired to a nunnery she had founded in c.&amp;nbsp;991 at [[Selz Abbey|Selz]] in [[Alsace]].&lt;ref&gt;“[http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-adelaide-of-burgundy Saint Adelaide of Bugundy]”. Saints.SQPN.com. 15 June 2012. Web. {2012-9-20}.&lt;/ref&gt; Though she never became a nun, she spent the rest of her days there in prayer. On her way to [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] to support her nephew [[Rudolph III of Burgundy|Rudolf&amp;nbsp;III]] against a rebellion, she died at Selz Abbey on December&amp;nbsp;16, 999, days short of the millennium she thought would bring the [[Second Coming of Christ]]. She had constantly devoted herself to the service of the church and peace, and to the empire as guardian of both; she also interested herself in the conversion of the Slavs. She was thus a principal agent&amp;mdash;almost an embodiment&amp;mdash;of the work of the [[Catholic Church]] during the [[Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]] in the construction of the religion-culture of western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Saints: A concise Biographical Dictionary&quot;, edited by John Coulson, published by Hawthorn Books, Inc. 1960.[http://www.ewtn.com/library/mary/adelaide.HTM]&lt;/ref&gt;
A part of her relics are preserved in a shrine in Hanover. Her feast day, December 16, is still kept in many German dioceses.

==Issue==
In 947, Adelaide was married to King [[Lothair II of Italy]]. The union produced one child:
*[[Emma of Italy]] - born 948, queen of France and wife of [[Lothair of France]]

In 951, Adelaide was married to King [[Otto I]], the future Holy Roman Emperor. The union produced four children:
*Henry - born 952
*Bruno - born 953
*[[Matilda, Abbess of Quedlinburg|Matilda]] - born 954, the first [[Princess-Abbess of Quedlinburg]]
*[[Otto II]] - born 955, later [[Holy Roman Emperor]]

==Legacy==
Adelaïde is the heroine of [[Gioacchino Rossini]]'s 1817 [[opera]], ''[[Adelaide di Borgogna]]'' and [[William Bernard McCabe]]'s 1856 novel ''Adelaide, Queen of Italy, or The Iron Crown''.

Adelaide is a featured figure on [[Judy Chicago]]'s installation piece ''[[The Dinner Party]]'', being represented as one of the 999 names on the ''[[List of women in the Heritage Floor|Heritage Floor]].''&lt;ref name=&quot;Adelaide&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2007 | title=Adelaide | work=Elizabeth A.
