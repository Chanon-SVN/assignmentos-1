'''Action Against Hunger''' (known internationally as '''Action Contre la Faim''', or '''ACF International''') is an international humanitarian organization that intends to end world hunger. Action Against Hunger's primary aim is to respond to emergency situations of wars, conflicts, and natural disasters. The services of the organization includes nutrition and health, water and sanitation, and food security.  The group services more than 5&amp;nbsp;million people in more than 40 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACF International|url=http://www.actionagainsthunger.org/about/acf-international|publisher=Action Against Hunger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Action Against Hunger (ACF) was established in 1979 by a group of French doctors, scientists, and writers. Nobel Prize-winning physicist [[Alfred Kastler]] served as the organization’s first chairman.

ACF initially provided assistance to [[Afghan refugees]] in [[Pakistan]], famine-stricken [[Uganda]]n communities, and [[Cambodia]]n refugees in [[Thailand]].  It expanded to address additional humanitarian concerns in Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the Balkans and elsewhere during the 1980s and 1990s. Action Against Hunger’s Scientific Committee pioneered the therapeutic milk formula ([[F-100 (food)|F100]]), now used by all major humanitarian aid organizations to treat [[acute malnutrition]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} As a result, the global mortality rate of severely malnourished children under the age of five has been reduced from 25% to 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition and evaluation of therapeutic food for severely malnourished children in  situations of humanitarian emergencies|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10188315|publisher=PubMed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Action Against Hunger – USA was established in 1985 and became the first member of what is now ACF International. ACF International currently has headquarters in five countries – France, Spain, the United States, Canada and the UK. The group's policies include independence, impartiality, nondiscrimination, free and direct access to victims, professionalism, and transparency.

The organization operates feeding centers, food and supply distributions and provides water and sanitation facilities. The group also provides training in nutrition, water and sanitation, food security, and health care. ACF utilizes experts and local staff when developing programs.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

{{Main|Muttur massacre|Attacks on humanitarian workers#2006}}

In 2006, seventeen Action Against Hunger workers were killed in [[Muttur (Sri Lanka)|Muttur, Sri Lanka]] while aiding with the reconstruction effort after the [[2004 Tsunami]]. The [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) had recently had a firefight with Sri Lankan government forces in the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reddy|first=B.

==Activities==

The organization sets up feeding centers as an attempt to feed malnourished children. The organization also intends to control and prevent malnutrition through child-growth monitoring, nutritional surveys, and public education. Therapeutic feeding centers treat children with acute severe malnutrition through programs involving medical treatment.

The group also provides access to drinking water, through the drilling of wells, tapping springs, and installing water systems. Local members and communities receive training, as an effort to maintain equipment and work with local populations on the issue of drinking water.

The organization distributes seeds and tools, and conducts training programs in income-generating activities such as Farmer Field School (FFS), gardening, animal breeding, and food conservation as an effort to improve food security.

The organization also sets up mother and child health centers to provide immunization and pre/post-natal care. The public health programs include the training of medical staff, the monitoring and control epidemics, and rehabilitation clinics.

===Advocacy===
Action Against Hunger intends to raise awareness about hunger and seeks to alert the international community when human rights, especially the right to food, are perceived to be violated.

==Action Against Hunger Humanitarian Award==
The Action Against Hunger Humanitarian Award recognizes individuals who have been perceived to have made substantive contributions to the humanitarian field through philanthropy, public awareness, or their efforts to improve conditions for communities.

In 2009, ACF honored the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]] and its [[Director-General]], [[Jacques Diouf]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/news/story/pt/item/47266/icode/en/ FAO Media Centre: Action against Hunger honors J. Diouf&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; for their perceived commitment towards preventing hunger and poverty.

In 2008, [[Anderson Cooper]] was the first journalist to receive the Action Against Hunger Humanitarian Award. He was selected as the recipient for the award in 2008 for his ongoing coverage of global issues perceived to be important, and for bringing awareness of humanitarian tragedies for the American public.

In 2007, film director and Academy Award nominee [[Terry George]] was the recipient of the annual award for his perceived humanitarian commitments, and the impact of his depiction of the Rwandan Genocide in his movie, Hotel Rwanda.

The 2006 Action Against Hunger Humanitarian Award recipient was [[Susan Sarandon]], for her work as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, and the advocacy of victims of hunger and HIV/AIDS.

In 2005, the recipient of the award was the Nobel Laureate [[Archbishop Desmond Tutu]] in recognition of his efforts against hunger, malnutrition and poverty.

Past recipients of the award have included Nobel Laureate and former South African President [[Nelson Mandela]] (2004), as well as author [[Frank McCourt]] (2002), and [[Jeff Bridges]], among others.

==Campaigns and activities==

===Athletes Against Hunger===
Some athletes intend to raise awareness and funds for Action Against Hunger. This informal assemblage of athletes were dubbed &quot;Athletes Against Hunger&quot;. The group also generates publicity through climbing [[Mount Everest]], cross country inline skating and hiking the Appalachian Trail.

===Race Against Hunger===
The Race Against Hunger is a campaign that intends to unite international middle and high school students, against global hunger and malnutrition. The Race aims to educate American students about the causes of global hunger and intends to generate attention and awareness towards the issue.

The educational component of the Race involves an interactive program about global hunger that teachers implement in their classrooms. Recognizing the paradox of hunger in the developing world amidst an obesity epidemic in the United States, the curriculum is followed by an opportunity for students to engage in activity through a “fun-run” event. Students seek sponsorships for the “fun-run”, and the proceeds raised by students are intended to support Action Against Hunger’s programs.

In 2003, [[Zidane]] attended the Race Against Hunger organized by Action Against Hunger Spain (also known as Acción Contra el Hambre) held at the French Lyceum of Madrid. This event raised an estimated 25,000 Euros.

===Restaurants Against Hunger===
Action Against Hunger's annual Restaurants Against Hunger Campaign partners with leaders from the food and beverage industry to bring attention to global hunger. Each year, the campaign raises funds and support for Action Against Hunger’s programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.restaurantsagainsthunger.org Love Food Give Food - Action Against Hunger&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actionagainsthunger.org/get-involved/restaurants-against-hunger Restaurants Against Hunger | Action Against Hunger&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various singers have performed at the annual Restaurants Against Hunger Spring Gala including [[Kaïssa]] and Clara Lofaro.

===Love Food Give Food===
Action Against Hunger's program, Love Food Give Food, intends to allow people who are interested in food to raise funds that intend to save the lives of malnourished children. As the food and drink industry’s chosen charity,  the program strives to bring attention to the problem of global hunger and raise over £1 million annually for this cause.

During the months of September and October, certain restaurants fundraise for Love Food Give Food by adding an amount of money to the price of certain items. Other restaurants support the program year-round.

During 2011, Love Food Give Food asks participants to host dinner parties for Action Against Hunger, requesting participants of dinner parties to donate to Action Against Hunger. Certain celebrity chefs support Love Food Give Food by providing recipes for the dinner parties.
