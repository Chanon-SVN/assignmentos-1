'''Antibiotics''' or '''antibacterials''' are a type of [[antimicrobial]] used specifically against [[bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;NHS&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Antibiotics-penicillins/Pages/Introduction.aspx | title=Antibiotics| publisher=NHS | date=05/06/2014 | accessdate=December 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ECDC Expert&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ecdc.europa.eu/en/eaad/antibiotics/Pages/factsExperts.aspx | title=Factsheet for experts | publisher=European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control | accessdate=December 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are often used in [[medical treatment]] of bacterial [[infection]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHS&quot;/&gt; They may either kill or inhibit the growth of bacteria. Several antibiotic agents are also effective against a number of [[fungi]], [[protozoan]]s and some are toxic to humans and animals, even when given in [[therapeutic dosage]]. Antibiotics are not effective against [[virus]]es such as the [[common cold]] or [[influenza]], and may be harmful when taken inappropriately.

&lt;!-- Synthesis &amp; Usage --&gt;
&lt;!-- Resistance --&gt;
Antibiotics revolutionized medicine in the 20th century, and have together with vaccination lead to the near eradication of diseases such as [[tuberculosis]] in the developed world. Their effectiveness and easy access led to overuse, especially in live-stock raising, prompting bacteria to develop resistance. This has led to widespread problems with [[antimicrobial resistance|antimicrobial]] and [[antibiotic resistance]],&lt;!--{{cn}}--&gt; so much as to prompt the [[World Health Organization]] to classify antimicrobial resistance as a &quot;serious threat [that] is no longer a prediction for the future, it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone, of any age, in any country&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO Global&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/amr-report/en/ | title=WHO’s first global report on antibiotic resistance reveals serious, worldwide threat to public health| publisher=The World Health Organization | date=April 30, 2014 | accessdate=December 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--History, Etymology --&gt;
The antibacterial era began in 1907 with the discovery of [[arsphenamine]], first synthesized by [[Alferd Bertheim]] and [[Paul Ehrlich]] in 1907 and used to treat syphilis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2726818/&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread use came with [[penicillin]], which was discovered by [[Alexander Fleming]] in 1928 for which he was awarded the 1945 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] together with [[Howard Florey]] and [[Ernst Boris Chain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lesprixnobel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander Fleming Biography|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1945/fleming.html|work=Les Prix Nobel| publisher=The Nobel Foundation|year=1945|accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = McIntyre N | title = Sir Alexander Fleming | journal = Journal of medical biography | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 234 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18615899 | doi=10.1258/j.jmb.2007.05-72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hugh TB | title = Howard Florey, Alexander Fleming and the fairy tale of penicillin | journal = The Medical journal of Australia | volume = 177 | issue = 1 | pages = 52–53; author 53 53 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12436980 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Raju TN | title = The Nobel chronicles. 1945: Sir Alexander Fleming (1881-1955); Sir Ernst Boris Chain (1906-79); and Baron Howard Walter Florey (1898-1968) | journal = Lancet | volume = 353 | issue = 9156 | pages = 936 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10094026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mazumdar PM | title = Fleming as Bacteriologist: Alexander Fleming | journal = Science | volume = 225 | issue = 4667 | pages = 1140–1141 | year = 1984 | pmid = 17782415 | pmc = | doi = 10.1126/science.225.4667.1140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;natureobit&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Robert Cruickshank | title = Sir Alexander Fleming, F.R.S | journal = Nature | volume = 175 | issue = 4459 | pages = 663 | year = 1955 | pmid = | pmc = | doi = 10.1038/175663a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Sometimes the term antibiotic is used to refer to any substance used against microbes,&lt;ref name=&quot;AmHer&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language, 5th edition | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; synonymous to [[antimicrobial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th Edition | publisher=Elsevier | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources distinguish between antibacterial and antibiotic, with antimicrobials used in soaps and cleaners etc., but not as medicine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tufts APUA&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tufts.edu/med/apua/about_issue/agents.shtml#1 | title=General Background: Antibiotic Agents | work=Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics | accessdate=December 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article treats the terms are synonymous and according to the most widespread definition of antibiotics being a substance used against bacteria.

==Pharmacodynamics==
{{Main|Antimicrobial pharmacodynamics}}
The successful outcome of antimicrobial therapy with antibacterial compounds depends on several factors. These include [[Immune system|host defense mechanisms]], the location of infection, and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the antibacterial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pankey2004&quot;/&gt; A bactericidal activity of antibacterials may depend on the bacterial growth phase, and it often requires ongoing metabolic activity and division of bacterial cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bactericidal action of daptomycin against stationary-phase and nondividing Staphylococcus aureus cells&quot;/&gt; These findings are based on laboratory studies, and in clinical settings have also been shown to eliminate bacterial infection.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pankey2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pelczar, M.J., Chan, E.C.S. and Krieg, N.R. (1999) &quot;Host-Parasite Interaction; Nonspecific Host Resistance&quot;, In: Microbiology Concepts and Applications, 6th ed., McGraw-Hill Inc., New York, U.S.A. pp.&amp;nbsp;478–479.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the activity of antibacterials depends frequently on its concentration,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhee2004&quot;/&gt; ''in vitro'' characterization of antibacterial activity commonly includes the determination of the [[minimum inhibitory concentration]] and minimum bactericidal concentration of an antibacterial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pankey2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Agar and broth dilution methods to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)of antimicrobial substances&quot;/&gt;
To predict clinical outcome, the antimicrobial activity of an antibacterial is usually combined with its [[Pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] profile, and several pharmacological parameters are used as markers of drug efficacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Antibiotic therapy for severe bacterial infections: correlation between the inhibitory quotient and outcome&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharma2002&quot;/&gt;

==Classes==
{{Main|List of antibiotics}}
[[File:Antibiotics action.png|right|thumb|150px|Molecular targets of antibiotics on the bacteria cell]]

Antibacterial antibiotics are commonly classified based on their mechanism of action, chemical structure, or spectrum of activity. Most target bacterial functions or growth processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;CALDERIN2007&quot;/&gt; Those that target the bacterial cell wall ([[penicillin]]s and [[cephalosporin]]s) or the cell membrane ([[polymyxins]]), or interfere with essential bacterial enzymes ([[rifamycin]]s, [[lipiarmycin]]s, [[quinolone]]s, and [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]]) have [[bactericidal]] activities. Those that target protein synthesis ([[macrolide]]s, [[lincosamides]] and [[tetracycline]]s) are usually [[bacteriostatic]] (with the exception of bactericidal [[aminoglycoside]]s).&lt;ref name=&quot;The importance of bactericidal drugs: future directions in infectious disease&quot;/&gt; Further categorization is based on their target specificity. &quot;Narrow-spectrum&quot; antibacterial antibiotics target specific types of bacteria, such as [[Gram-negative]] or [[Gram-positive]] bacteria, whereas broad-spectrum antibiotics affect a wide range of bacteria. Following a 40-year hiatus in discovering new classes of antibacterial compounds, four new classes of antibacterial antibiotics have been brought into clinical use:{{when|date=January 2015}} cyclic [[lipopeptides]] (such as [[daptomycin]]), [[glycylcyclines]] (such as [[tigecycline]]), [[oxazolidinone]]s (such as [[linezolid]]), and [[lipiarmycin]]s (such as [[fidaxomicin]]).&lt;ref&gt;Cunha BA. Antibiotic Essentials 2009. Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning, ISBN 978-0-7637-7219-2 p. 180, for example.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.mib.2011.07.030 |title=New target for inhibition of bacterial RNA polymerase: 'switch region' |year=2011 |last1=Srivastava |first1=Aashish |last2=Talaue |first2=Meliza |last3=Liu |first3=Shuang |last4=Degen |first4=David |last5=Ebright |first5=Richard Y |last6=Sineva |first6=Elena |last7=Chakraborty |first7=Anirban |last8=Druzhinin |first8=Sergey Y |last9=Chatterjee |first9=Sujoy |last10=Mukhopadhyay |first10=Jayanta |last11=Ebright |first11=Yon W |last12=Zozula |first12=Alex |last13=Shen |first13=Juan |last14=Sengupta |first14=Sonali |last15=Niedfeldt |first15=Rui Rong |last16=Xin |first16=Cai |last17=Kaneko |first17=Takushi |last18=Irschik |first18=Herbert |last19=Jansen |first19=Rolf |last20=Donadio |first20=Stefano |last21=Connell |first21=Nancy |last22=[[Richard H.

==Production==
{{Main|Production of antibiotics}}
With advances in [[medicinal chemistry]], most modern antibacterials are [[semisynthetic]] modifications of various natural compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=von Nussbaum F. ''et al.'' |title=Medicinal Chemistry of Antibacterial Natural Products – Exodus or Revival?|journal=Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. |volume=45 |issue=31 |pages=5072–5129 |year=2006 |pmid= 16881035 |doi=10.1002/anie.200600350 |last2=Brands |first2=Michael |last3=Hinzen |first3=Berthold |last4=Weigand |first4=Stefan |last5=Häbich |first5=Dieter}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include, for example, the [[beta-lactam antibiotics]], which include the [[penicillin]]s (produced by fungi in the genus ''[[Penicillium]]''), the [[cephalosporin]]s, and the [[carbapenem]]s. Compounds that are still isolated from living organisms are the [[aminoglycoside]]s, whereas other antibacterials—for example, the [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]], the [[quinolone]]s, and the [[oxazolidinone]]s—are produced solely by chemical synthesis. In accordance with this, many antibacterial compounds are classified on the basis of chemical/[[biosynthesis|biosynthetic]] origin into natural, semisynthetic, and synthetic. Another classification system is based on biological activity; in this classification, antibacterials are divided into two broad groups according to their biological effect on microorganisms: [[Bactericide|Bactericidal]] agents kill bacteria, and [[bacteriostatic agent]]s slow down or stall bacterial growth.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}
Many antibacterial compounds are relatively [[small molecule]]s with a [[molecular weight]] of less than 2000 [[atomic mass unit]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Since the first pioneering efforts of [[Howard Florey, Baron Florey|Florey]] and [[Ernst Boris Chain|Chain]] in 1939, the importance of antibiotics, including antibacterials, to [[medicine]] has led to intense research into producing antibacterials at large scales. Following screening of antibacterials against a wide range of bacteria, production of the active compounds is carried out using [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]], usually in strongly aerobic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Encyclopedia|page=305|author=William Andrew Publishing|publisher=Elsevier Science |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administration==
Oral antibiotics are taken by mouth, whereas [[intravenous]] administration may be used in more serious cases, {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} such as deep-seated [[systemic infection]]s. Antibiotics may also sometimes be administered [[topical]]ly, as with [[eye drop]]s or [[ointment]]s.

The topical antibiotics are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://athena.targetwoman.com/antibiotics |title=Topical Antibiotics |accessdate=July 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Erythromycin
* Clindamycin
* Gentamycin
* Tetracycline
* Meclocycline
* (Sodium) sulfacetamide
While topical medications that act as Comedolytics as well as antibiotics are:
* Benzoyl peroxide
* Azelaic acid

==Side-effects==
[[File:Choosing Wisely antibiotics poster small English.pdf|thumb|right|Health advocacy messages such as this one encourage patients to talk with their doctor about safety in using antibiotics.]]
Antibiotics are screened for any negative effects on humans or other mammals before approval for clinical use, and are usually considered safe and most are well-tolerated. However, some antibiotics have been associated with a range of adverse [[side effects]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15993671&quot;/&gt;
Side-effects range from mild to very serious depending on the antibiotics used, the microbial organisms targeted, and the individual patient.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Safety profiles of newer drugs are often not as well-established as for those that have a long history of use.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15993671&quot;/&gt; Adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions, including [[photodermatitis]] and anaphylaxis.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Common side-effects include [[diarrhea]], resulting from disruption of the species composition in the [[intestinal flora]], resulting, for example, in overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria, such as ''[[Clostridium difficile]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea - All you should know |accessdate=2014-12-28|url=http://www.bestnaturalremedies.net/antibiotic-associated-diarrhea}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibacterials can also affect the [[vaginal flora]], and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]'' in the vulvo-vaginal area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pirotta and Garland&quot;/&gt; Additional side-effects can result from interaction with other drugs, such as elevated risk of [[tendon]] damage from administration of a [[Quinolones|quinolone]] antibiotic with a systemic [[corticosteroid]]. Some scientists have hypothesized that the indiscriminate use of antibiotics alter the host microbiota and this has been associated with [[chronic disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4236/oji.2012.22007 |title=The law of unintended consequences and antibiotics |year=2012 |last1=Thacker |first1=James D. |journal=Open Journal of Immunology |volume=02 |issue=2 |pages=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antibiotics and Chronic Liver Diseases|url=http://www.sinomedresearch.org/hcv/articles/c17_ABX.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drug-drug interactions==

===Birth control pills===
The majority of studies indicate antibiotics do not interfere with [[contraceptive pill]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;Weaver1999&quot;/&gt; such as clinical studies that suggest the failure rate of contraceptive pills caused by antibiotics is very low (about 1%).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10384856&quot;/&gt; In cases where antibacterials have been suggested to affect the efficiency of birth control pills, such as for the broad-spectrum antibacterial [[rifampicin]], these cases may be due to an increase in the activities of hepatic liver enzymes' causing increased breakdown of the pill's active ingredients.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weaver1999&quot;/&gt; Effects on the intestinal flora, which might result in reduced absorption of estrogens in the colon, have also been suggested, but such suggestions have been inconclusive and controversial.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid3155374&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid2256523&quot;/&gt; Clinicians have recommended that extra contraceptive measures be applied during therapies using antibacterials that are suspected to interact with oral contraceptives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weaver1999&quot;/&gt;

===Alcohol===
Interactions between alcohol and certain antibiotics may occur and may cause side-effects and decreased effectiveness of antibiotic therapy.&lt;ref name=&quot;bmj&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;antibiotics-and-alcohol&quot;/&gt;
:&quot;It is sensible to avoid drinking alcohol when taking medication. However, it is unlikely that drinking alcohol in moderation will cause problems if you are taking most common antibiotics. However, there are specific types of antibiotics with which alcohol should be avoided completely, because of serious side-effects.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NHS&quot; /&gt;
Therefore, potential risks of side-effects and effectiveness depend on the type of antibiotic administered. Despite the lack of a categorical counterindication, the belief that alcohol and antibiotics should never be mixed is widespread.

Antibiotics such as [[metronidazole]], [[tinidazole]], [[cephamandole]], [[latamoxef]], [[cefoperazone]], [[cefmenoxime]], and [[furazolidone]], cause a [[disulfiram]]-like chemical reaction with alcohol by inhibiting its breakdown by [[acetaldehyde dehydrogenase]], which may result in vomiting, nausea, and shortness of breath.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHS&quot;/&gt;

Other effects of alcohol on antibiotic activity include altered activity of the liver enzymes that break down the antibiotic compound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Antibiotics FAQ&quot;/&gt; In addition, serum levels of doxycycline and [[erythromycin]] succinate{{Clarify|Why do these serum levels matter?|date=February 2010}} two bacteriostatic antibiotics (see above) may be reduced by alcohol consumption, resulting in reduced efficacy and diminished pharmacotherapeutic effect.&lt;ref name= &quot;Stockley2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Stockley |first= IH |year= 2002 |title=  Stockley's Drug Interactions |edition= 6th |location=  London |publisher= Pharmaceutical Press}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resistance==
{{Main|Antibiotic resistance}}

[[File:MRSA7820.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Scanning electron micrograph|SEM]] depicting [[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] bacteria]]

The emergence of resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is a common phenomenon. Emergence of resistance often reflects [[evolution]]ary processes that take place during antibiotic therapy. The antibiotic treatment may [[Natural selection|select]] for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibiotics. Under certain conditions, it may result in preferential growth of resistant bacteria, while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug.&lt;ref name=&quot;Balancing the drug-resistance equation&quot;/&gt; For example, antibacterial selection for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the [[Luria–Delbrück experiment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mutations of Bacteria from Virus Sensitivity to Virus Resistance&quot;/&gt; Antibiotics such as penicillin and erythromycin, which used to have a high efficacy against many bacterial species and strains, have become less effective, due to the increased resistance of many bacterial strains.&lt;ref name=&quot;voanews.com&quot;/&gt;

Resistance may take the form of biodegredation of pharmaceuticals, such as sulfamethazine-degrading soil bacteria introduced to sulfamethazine through medicated pig feces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/abstract/?id=27587000000610 |title=Accelerated Biodegradation of Veterinary Antibiotics in Agricultural Soil following Long-Term Exposure, and Isolation of a Sulfamethazine-degrading Microbacterium sp |journal=Journal of Environmental Quality |volume=42|pages=173–178 |doi=10.2134/jeq2012.0162 |pmid=23673752 |year=2013 |last1=Topp |first1=E |last2=Chapman |first2=R |last3=Devers-Lamrani |first3=M |last4=Hartmann |first4=A |last5=Marti |first5=R |last6=Martin-Laurent |first6=F |last7=Sabourin |first7=L |last8=Scott |first8=A |last9=Sumarah |first9=M |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The survival of bacteria often results from an inheritable resistance,&lt;ref name=&quot;Witte2004&quot;/&gt; but the growth of resistance to antibacterials also occurs through [[horizontal gene transfer]]. Horizontal transfer is more likely to happen in locations of frequent antibiotic use.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Field Guide To Bacteria, The World Of Bacteria&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Dyer|first=Betsey Dexter|title=A Field Guide To Bacteria|year=2003|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=978-0-8014-8854-2|chapter=Chapter 9, Pathogens|url=http://www.audible.com/pd/ref=sr_1_1?asin=B002VA8L4Y&amp;qid=1305345229&amp;sr=1-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antibacterial resistance may impose a biological cost, thereby reducing [[biological fitness|fitness]] of resistant strains, which can limit the spread of antibacterial-resistant bacteria, for example, in the absence of antibacterial compounds. Additional mutations, however, may compensate for this fitness cost and can aid the survival of these bacteria.&lt;ref name=&quot;The biological cost of mutational antibiotic resistance: any practical conclusions?&quot;/&gt;

Paleontological data show that both antibiotics and antibiotic resistance are ancient compounds and mechanisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;D'Costa2011&quot;/&gt; Useful antibiotic targets are those for which mutations negatively impact bacterial reproduction or viability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gladki2013&quot;/&gt;

Several molecular mechanisms of antibacterial resistance exist. Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alekshun2007&quot;/&gt; For example, an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial [[genome]]. Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alekshun2007&quot;/&gt; Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to, and may have been transferred to, antibacterial-resistant strains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glycopeptide antibiotic resistance genes in glycopeptide-producing organisms&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Multidrug Resistance in Bacteria&quot;/&gt; The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by [[Horizontal gene transfer|horizontal genetic exchange]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Witte2004&quot;/&gt; For instance, antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via [[plasmids]] that carry these resistance genes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Witte2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker2006&quot;/&gt; Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker2006&quot;/&gt; Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker2006&quot;/&gt;

Antibacterial-resistant strains and species, sometimes referred to as &quot;superbugs&quot;, now contribute to the emergence of diseases that were for a while well-controlled. For example, emergent bacterial strains causing [[tuberculosis]] (TB) that are resistant to previously effective antibacterial treatments pose many therapeutic challenges. Every year, nearly half a million new cases of [[multidrug-resistant tuberculosis]] (MDR-TB) are estimated to occur worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2009/tuberculosis_drug_resistant_20090402/en/index.html Health ministers to accelerate efforts against drug-resistant TB]&quot;. ''World Health Organization (WHO).''&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[NDM-1]] is a newly identified enzyme conveying bacterial resistance to a broad range of [[beta-lactam]] antibacterials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Are you ready for a world without antibiotics?&quot;/&gt; The United Kingdom's [[Health Protection Agency]] has stated that &quot;most isolates with NDM-1 enzyme are resistant to all standard intravenous antibiotics for treatment of severe infections.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Health Protection Report&quot;/&gt;

===Misuse===
[[File:CDC Get Smart poster healthy adult.png|thumb|This poster from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &quot;Get Smart&quot; campaign, intended for use in doctors' offices and other healthcare facilities, warns that antibiotics do not work for viral illnesses such as the common cold.]]

{{main|Antibiotic misuse}}

Per the ''The ICU Book'' &quot;The first rule of antibiotics is try not to use them, and the second rule is try not to use too many of them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marino&quot;/&gt;

Inappropriate antibiotic treatment and overuse of antibiotics have contributed to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. [[Self-prescribing|Self prescription]] of antibiotics is an example of misuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson2007&quot;/&gt; Many antibiotics are frequently prescribed to treat symptoms or diseases that do not respond to antibiotics or that are likely to resolve without treatment. Also incorrect or suboptimal antibiotics are prescribed for certain bacterial infections.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15993671&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson2007&quot;/&gt; The overuse of antibiotics, like penicillin and erythromycin, have been associated with emerging antibiotic resistance since the 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;voanews.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawkey2008&quot;/&gt; Widespread usage of antibiotics in hospitals has also been associated with increases in bacterial strains and species that no longer respond to treatment with the most common antibiotics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawkey2008&quot;/&gt;

Common forms of antibiotic misuse include excessive use of [[prophylaxis|prophylactic]] antibiotics in travelers and failure of medical professionals to prescribe the correct dosage of antibiotics on the basis of the patient's weight and history of prior use. Other forms of misuse include failure to take the entire prescribed course of the antibiotic, incorrect dosage and administration, or failure to rest for sufficient recovery. Inappropriate antibiotic treatment, for example, is their prescription to treat viral infections such as the [[common cold]]. One study on [[respiratory tract infection]]s found &quot;physicians were more likely to prescribe antibiotics to patients who appeared to expect them&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17467120&quot;/&gt; Multifactorial interventions aimed at both physicians and patients can reduce inappropriate prescription of antibiotics.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17509729&quot;/&gt;

Several organizations concerned with antimicrobial resistance are lobbying to eliminate the unnecessary use of antibiotics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Larson2007&quot;/&gt; The issues of misuse and overuse of antibiotics have been addressed by the formation of the U.S. Interagency Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance. This task force aims to actively address antimicrobial resistance, and is coordinated by the US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), and the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), as well as other US agencies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pharmguide&quot;/&gt; An NGO campaign group is ''Keep Antibiotics Working''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keep Antibiotics Working&quot;/&gt; In France, an &quot;Antibiotics are not automatic&quot; government campaign started in 2002 and led to a marked reduction of unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions, especially in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Sabuncu E, David J, Bernède-Bauduin C ''et al.'' |editor1-last= Klugman |editor1-first= Keith P. |title= Significant reduction of antibiotic use in the community after a nationwide campaign in France, 2002–2007 |year=2009 |journal= PLoS Med |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=e1000084 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1000084 |url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000084 |pmid= 19492093 |pmc= 2683932|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uJyYYA93 |archivedate = 17 November 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of antibiotic resistance has prompted restrictions on their use in the UK in 1970 (Swann report 1969), and the EU has banned the use of antibiotics as growth-promotional agents since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legaltext.ee/text/en/T80294.htm (accessed 12 November 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, several organizations (e.g., The American Society for Microbiology (ASM), American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Medical Association (AMA)) have called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production and an end to all nontherapeutic uses. {{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} However, commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics, attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics, and to the time required for research to test causal links between their use and resistance to them. Two federal bills (S.742&lt;ref name=&quot;USbill1&quot;/&gt; and H.R. 2562&lt;ref name=&quot;USbill2&quot;/&gt;) aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in US food animals were proposed, but have not passed.&lt;ref name=&quot;USbill1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USbill2&quot;/&gt; These bills were endorsed by public health and medical organizations, including the American Holistic Nurses' Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Public Health Association (APHA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.acpm.org/2003051H.pdf |accessdate= 12 November 2008}}{{Dead link|date= June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been extensive use of antibiotics in animal husbandry. In the United States, the question of emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains due to [[Antibiotic use in livestock|use of antibiotics in livestock]] was raised by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1977. In March 2012, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, ruling in an action brought by the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] and others, ordered the FDA to revoke approvals for the use of antibiotics in livestock, which violated FDA regulations.&lt;ref name=MPFDA&gt;{{cite news |title=FDA Told to Move on Antibiotic Use in Livestock |url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/FDAGeneral/31792 |accessdate=24 March 2012 |newspaper=MedPage Today|date=23 March 2012|author=John Gever}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives==
The increase in bacterial strains that are resistant to conventional antibacterial therapies has prompted the development of bacterial disease treatment strategies that are alternatives to conventional antibacterials.

===Resistance-modifying agents===
One strategy to address bacterial drug resistance is the discovery and application of compounds that modify resistance to common antibacterials. For example, some resistance-modifying agents may inhibit multidrug resistance mechanisms, such as [[drug efflux]] from the cell, thus increasing the susceptibility of bacteria to an antibacterial. Targets include:
* The [[Efflux (microbiology)|efflux inhibitor]] Phe-Arg-β-naphthylamide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biochi.2005.04.012 |title=Bacterial efflux systems and efflux pumps inhibitors |year=2005 |last1=Marquez |first1=Béatrice |journal=Biochimie |volume=87 |issue=12 |pages=1137–47 |pmid=15951096}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Beta-lactamase inhibitors, such as [[clavulanic acid]] and [[sulbactam]].
Metabolic stimuli such as sugar can help eradicate a certain type of antibiotic-tolerant bacteria by keeping their metabolism active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature10069 |title=Metabolite-enabled eradication of bacterial persisters by aminoglycosides |year=2011 |last1=Allison |first1=Kyle R. |last2=Brynildsen |first2=Mark P. |last3=Collins |first3=James J. |journal=Nature |volume=473 |issue=7346 |pages=216–20 |pmid=21562562 |pmc=3145328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vaccines===
[[Vaccine]]s rely on [[immune]] modulation or augmentation. Vaccination either excites or reinforces the immune competence of a host to ward off infection, leading to the activation of [[macrophages]], the production of [[antibody|antibodies]], [[inflammation]], and other classic immune reactions. Antibacterial vaccines have been responsible for a drastic reduction in global bacterial diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Emerging Trends in Antibacterial Discovery: Answering the Call to Arms | publisher = Horizon Scientific Press | year = 2011 | author = Alita A. Miller, Paul F. Miller | chapter = Current Strategies for Antibacterial Vaccine development | page = 283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaccines made from attenuated whole cells or lysates have been replaced largely by less reactogenic, cell-free vaccines consisting of purified components, including capsular polysaccharides and their conjugates, to protein carriers, as well as inactivated toxins (toxoids) and proteins.&lt;ref name=MillerAAMillerPF&gt;{{cite book | author= Miller, AA; Miller, PF (editor) | year=2011 | title=Emerging Trends in Antibacterial Discovery: Answering the Call to Arms | publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] | isbn= 978-1-904455-89-9}}{{page needed|date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phage Therapy===
When all else fails, specifically antibiotics and AMPs, there is still another option that is being studied for treating resistant strains of bacteria. This newer treatment involves fighting fire with fire. The way that researchers are doing this is by infecting pathogenic bacteria with their own viruses, more specifically, bacteriophages. Bacteriophages, also known simply as phages, are precisely bacterial viruses that infect bacteria by disrupting pathogenic bacterium lytic cycles (Sulakvelidze et al., 2001). By disrupting the lytic cycles of bacterium, phages destroy their metabolism, which eventually results in the cell’s death (Sulakvelidze et al., 2001). Phages will insert their DNA into the bacterium, allowing their DNA to be transcribed. Once their DNA is transcribed the cell will proceed to make new phages and as soon as they are ready to be released, the cell will lyse (Sulakvelidze et al., 2001). One of the worries about using phages to fight pathogens is that the phages will infect “good” bacteria, or the bacteria that are important in the everyday function of human beings. However, studies have proven that phages are very specific when they target bacteria, which makes researchers confident that bacteriophage therapy is the definite route to defeating antibiotic resistant bacteria (Sulakvelidze et al. 2001). Sulakvelidze, A., Alavidze, Z., Morris, Jr J. G., 2001. Bacteriophage Therapy. Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 45(3): 649–659.

==Status of new antibiotics development ==
In a policy report released by the [[Infectious Disease Society of America]] (IDSA) on April 2013, IDSA expressed grave concern over the weak pipeline of antibiotics to combat the growing ability of bacteria, especially the [[Gram-negative bacilli]] (GNB), to develop resistance to antibiotics. Since 2009, only 2 new antibiotics were approved in United States, and the number of new antibiotics annually approved for marketing continues to decline. The report could identify only seven antibiotics currently in [[Phases of clinical research|phase]] 2 or phase 3 clinical trials to treat the GNB, which includes ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', ''[[Salmonella]]'', ''[[Shigella]]'', and the ''[[Enterobacteriaceae]]'' bacteria, and these drugs do not address the entire spectrum of the resistance developed by those bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Drug pipeline for worst superbugs ‘on life support’: report |author=Steenhuysen, Julie |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/2013/04/18/us-antibiotics-superbugs-idINBRE93H05520130418?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=health&amp;utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter&amp;dlvrit=309303 |agency=Reuters |date=18 April 2013 |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IDSA2013&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/cid/cit152 |title=10 x '20 Progress—Development of New Drugs Active Against Gram-Negative Bacilli: An Update from the Infectious Diseases Society of America |year=2013 |last1=Boucher |first1=H.

Some of these seven new antibiotics are combination of existent antibiotics, including:
*Ceftolozane/[[tazobactam]] (CXA-201; CXA-101/tazobactam): [[Antipseudomonal]] [[cephalosporin]]/[[β-lactamase]] inhibitor combination (cell wall synthesis inhibitor). In phase 3.

*[[Plazomicin]] (ACHN-490): [[Aminoglycoside]] (protein synthesis inhibitor). In phase 2.

*[[Brilacidin]] (PMX-30063): Peptide defense protein mimetic (cell membrane disruption). In phase 2.
The IDSA’s prognosis for sustainable R&amp;D infrastructure for antibiotics development will depend upon clarification of FDA regulatory clinical trial guidance that would facilitate the speedy approval of new drugs, and the appropriate economic incentives for the pharmaceuticals companies to invest in this endeavor.&lt;ref name=IDSA2013/&gt;  On 12 December 2013, the Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment (ADAPT) Act of 2013 was introduced in the U.S. Congress. The ADAPT Act aims to fast track the drug development in order to combat the growing public health threat of 'superbugs'. Under this Act, FDA can approve antibiotics and antifungals needed for life-threatening infections based on data from smaller clinical trials. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] will reinforce the monitoring of the use of antibiotics that treat serious and life-threatening infections and the emerging resistance, and make the data publicly available. The FDA antibiotics labeling process, 'Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Microbial Organisms'’ or 'breakpoints' is also streamlined to allow the most up-to-date and cutting-edge data available to healthcare professionals under the new Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.house.gov/press-release/green-gingrey-introduce-adapt-act-safeguard-public-health|title=Green, Gingrey Introduce ADAPT Act to Safeguard Public Health|author=Press Release|publisher=U.S .Congress|date=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/lifesciences/HR3742.pdf|title=Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment Act of 2013|publisher=U.S. Congress|date=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress has been urged in 2014 from several parties to aid the development of new drugs via bills such as ADAPT. Allan Coukell, director of drugs and medical devices at The Pew Charitable Trusts, testified in from of the House Committee, in a statement published by Reuters, that &quot;By allowing drug developers to rely on smaller datasets, and clarifying FDA's authority to tolerate a higher level of uncertainty for these drugs when making a risk/benefit calculation, ADAPT would make the clinical trials more feasible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clarke|first1=Toni|title=U.S. Congress urged to pass bill to speed development of antibiotics|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/19/us-usa-congress-antibiotics-idUSKBN0HE25W20140919|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antibiotics antagonism==
[[Chloramphenicol]] and [[tetracyclines]] are antagonists to [[penicillins]] and [[aminoglycosides]].  This means the combined effect of two antibiotics from separate groups can be less than a single antibiotic.  However, this can vary depending on the species of bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/antibiotic+antagonism |title=antagonism |accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of antibiotics}}

[[File:Penicillin core.svg|thumb|170px|[[Penicillin]], the first natural antibiotic discovered by [[Alexander Fleming]] in 1928]]
Before the early 20th century, treatments for infections were based primarily on [[folk medicine|medicinal folklore]]. Mixtures with antimicrobial properties that were used in treatments of infections were described over 2000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Considerations for Determining if a Natural Product Is an Effective Wound-Healing Agent&quot;/&gt; Many ancient cultures, including the [[Ancient Egyptian medicine|ancient Egyptians]] and [[Ancient Greek medicine|ancient Greeks]], used specially selected [[mold]] and plant materials and extracts to treat [[infection]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Early history of wound treatment&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Moulds in ancient and more recent medicine&quot;/&gt; More recent observations made in the laboratory of antibiosis between microorganisms led to the discovery of natural antibacterials produced by microorganisms. [[Louis Pasteur]] observed, &quot;if we could intervene in the antagonism observed between some bacteria, it would offer perhaps the greatest hopes for therapeutics&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kingston2008&quot;/&gt;
The term 'antibiosis', meaning &quot;against life&quot;, was introduced by the French bacteriologist [[Jean Paul Vuillemin]] as a descriptive name of the phenomenon exhibited by these early antibacterial drugs.&lt;ref name=&quot;CALDERIN2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Early descriptions of antibiosis&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Foster |first1= W |last2= Raoult |first2= A |title= Early descriptions of antibiosis |journal= J R Coll Gen Pract |volume= 24 |issue= 149 |pages= 889–94 |date= December 1974 |pmid= 4618289 |pmc= 2157443 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibiosis was first described in 1877 in bacteria when Louis Pasteur and [[Robert Koch]] observed that an airborne bacillus could inhibit the growth of ''[[Bacillus anthracis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first= H |last= Landsberg |title= Prelude to the discovery of penicillin |journal= Isis |volume= 40 |issue= 3 |pages= 225–7 |year= 1949 |doi=10.1086/349043}}&lt;/ref&gt; These drugs were later renamed antibiotics by [[Selman Waksman]], an American microbiologist, in 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;CALDERIN2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman1947&quot;/&gt; Synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy as a science and development of antibacterials began in Germany with [[Paul Ehrlich]] in the late 1880s.&lt;ref name=&quot;CALDERIN2007&quot;/&gt; Ehrlich noted  certain dyes would color human, animal, or bacterial cells, whereas others did not. He then proposed the idea that it might be possible to create chemicals that would act as a selective drug that would bind to and kill bacteria without harming the human host. After screening hundreds of dyes against various organisms, he discovered a medicinally useful drug, the synthetic antibacterial [[salvarsan]]&lt;ref name=&quot;CALDERIN2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Limbird2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosch2008&quot;/&gt; now called arsphenamine.

The effects of some types of mold on infection had been noticed many times over the course of history (see: [[History of penicillin]]). In 1928, [[Alexander Fleming]] noticed the same effect in a [[Petri dish]], where a number of disease-causing bacteria were killed by a fungus of the genus ''Penicillium.'' Fleming postulated that the effect is mediated by an antibacterial compound he named [[penicillin]], and that its antibacterial properties could be exploited for chemotherapy. He initially characterized some of its biological properties, and attempted to use a crude preparation to treat some infections, but he was unable to pursue its further development without the aid of trained chemists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fleming1929&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sykes2001&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Alexander Fleming.jpg|thumb|left|Alexander Fleming]]
The first [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]] and first commercially available antibacterial, [[Prontosil]], was developed by a research team led by [[Gerhard Domagk]] in 1932 at the [[Bayer]] Laboratories of the [[IG Farben]] conglomerate in Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bosch2008&quot;/&gt; Domagk received the 1939 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize for Medicine]] for his efforts. Prontosil had a relatively broad effect against [[Gram-positive]] [[Coccus|cocci]], but not against [[Enterobacteriaceae|enterobacteria]]. Research was stimulated apace by its success. The discovery and development of this sulfonamide [[drug]] opened the era of antibacterials.

In 1939, coinciding with the start of World War II, [[Rene Dubos]] reported the discovery of the first naturally derived antibiotic, [[tyrothricin]], a compound of 20% [[gramicidin]] and 80% [[tyrocidine]], from ''B. brevis.'' It was one of the first commercially manufactured antibiotics universally and was very effective in treating wounds and ulcers during World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;Epps2006&quot;/&gt; Gramicidin, however, could not be used systemically because of toxicity. Tyrocidine also proved too toxic for systemic usage. Research results obtained during that period were not shared between the Axis and the Allied powers during the war.

Florey and Chain succeeded in purifying the first penicillin, [[penicillin G]], in 1942, but it did not become widely available outside the Allied military before 1945. The chemical structure of penicillin was determined by [[Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin]] in 1945. Purified penicillin displayed potent antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria and had low toxicity in humans. Furthermore, its activity was not inhibited by biological constituents such as pus, unlike the synthetic sulfonamides. The discovery of such a powerful antibiotic was unprecedented, and the development of penicillin led to renewed interest in the search for antibiotic compounds with similar efficacy and safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;Use of Micro-organisms for therapeutic purposes&quot;/&gt; For their successful development of penicillin, which Fleming had accidentally discovered but could not develop himself, as a therapeutic drug, [[Ernst Chain]] and [[Howard Florey]] shared the 1945 [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] with Fleming. Florey credited Dubos with pioneering the approach of deliberately and systematically searching for antibacterial compounds, which had led to the discovery of gramicidin and had revived Florey's research in penicillin.&lt;ref name=Epps2006/&gt;

===Etymology===
The term ''antibiotic'' was first used in 1942 by [[Selman Waksman]] and his collaborators in journal articles to describe any substance produced by a microorganism that is [[wikt:antagonism|antagonistic]] to the growth of other microorganisms in high dilution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wakeman1947&quot;/&gt; This definition excluded substances that kill bacteria but that are not produced by microorganisms (such as [[gastric juices]] and [[hydrogen peroxide]]). It also excluded [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] antibacterial compounds such as the [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The term &quot;antibiotic&quot; derives from ''anti'' + βιωτικός (''biōtikos''), &quot;fit for life, lively&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dbiwtiko%2Fs |chapter= βιωτικός |editor1-first= Henry George |editor1-last= Liddell |editor2-first= Robert |editor2-last= Scott |title= A Greek-English Lexicon |via= [[Perseus Project]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which comes from βίωσις (''biōsis''), &quot;way of life&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dbi%2Fwsis |chapter= βίωσις |editor1-first= Henry George |editor1-last= Liddell |editor2-first= Robert |editor2-last= Scott |title= A Greek-English Lexicon |via= [[Perseus Project]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that from βίος (''bios''), &quot;life&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Antibiotics FAQ&quot; /&gt;
