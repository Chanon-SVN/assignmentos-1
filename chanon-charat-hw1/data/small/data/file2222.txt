His accomplishments were described in the [[Orkhon inscriptions]].

==Names==

As was the custom, his personal name and the name after assuming the title Khagan were different. His personal name was : 阿史那默棘連, Ashǐnà mòjílián, a-shih-na mo-chi-lan) . His name after assuming the title was Bilge Khagan (or Bilge Qhagan). ([[Old Turkic]]: {{OldTurkicUnicode|𐰋𐰃𐰠𐰏𐰀 𐰴𐰍𐰣}}, Bilge qaγan,&lt;ref name=&quot;irq.kaznpu.kz&quot;/&gt; [[wikt:毗|毗]][[wikt:伽|伽]][[wikt:可|可]][[wikt:汗|汗]], [[Pinyin]]: píjiā kěhàn, [[Wade–Giles]]: p'i-chia k'o-han, official title: {{OldTurkicUnicode|𐱅𐰭𐰼𐰃𐱅𐰏 𐱅𐰭𐰼𐰃𐰓𐰀 𐰉𐰆𐰞𐰢𐱁 𐱅𐰇𐰼𐰜 𐰋𐰃𐰠𐰏𐰀 𐰴𐰍𐰣}}, Teŋіriteg Тeŋiride bolmuš Türük Bilge qaγan,&lt;ref&gt;[http://irq.kaznpu.kz/index.php?l=t&amp;wi=726&amp;lang=e&amp;mod=3 Ethno Cultural Dictionary, TÜRIK BITIG]&lt;/ref&gt; His wife was [[Po Beg]], [[Tonyukuk]]'s daughter. &quot;Bilge&quot; meaning &quot;wise&quot; or &quot;one who has wisdom&quot; in Turkic languages. Khagan (Kağan) is a title for ruler (like king, earl, etc.). &quot;Bilge&quot;, as is the case with many pure Turkic names, is a unisex name. Even in today's Turkis, Bilge continues to be adopted both as male and female name. Kağan or Kaan, however, is used only as male name in contemporary Turkish.

==As a khagan==
In 716, [[Kapaghan Khagan]] the second khaghan of the khaganate was killed in his campaign against [[Tokuz-Oguzes|Toquz Oghuz]] and his severed head was sent to [[Chang'an]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tang194&quot;&gt;''[[Old Book of Tang]]'', [[:zh:s:舊唐書/卷194上|Vol. 194-I]]&lt;/ref&gt; Although his son [[Inel Qaghan]] succeeded him, the legal claimant of the throne was his cousin Ashǐnà mòjílián. Mojilan's brother [[Kul Tigin]] and [[Tonyukuk]] carried out a [[coup d'état]] against Inel Qaghan. They killed Inel Qaghan and made Mojilan a khagan with the name Bilge Qaghan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tang194&quot;/&gt; His name literally means &quot;wise king&quot;.

Bilge's khaganate spanned vast steppes from the [[Caspian Sea]] to [[Manchuria]]; he also invaded the western sections of the [[China|Chinese]] territories. After his death from poisoning, several [[stela]]e were erected in [[Orkhon Valley|the capital area]] by the [[Orkhon River]]. These [[Orkhon inscriptions]] are the first known texts in the [[Old Turkic language]].
He was poisoned by Buyruk Chor&lt;ref&gt;[http://mtad.humanity.ankara.edu.tr/IV-3_Eylul2007/240_47_MTAD4-3_EEkrem.pdf Erkin Ekrem, &quot;Sarı Uygurların Kökeni&quot;, ''Modern Türklük Araştırma Dergisi'', Vol. 4, No. 3, 2007, p. 175.]&lt;/ref&gt; (梅錄啜/梅录啜, méilù chuò, mei-lu-ch'o). He didn't die immediately and he had time to punish the family of Buyruk Chor with death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tang194&quot;/&gt;
