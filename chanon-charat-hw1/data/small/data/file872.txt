'''Andrew II of Jerusalem''' ({{lang-hu|Jeruzsálemi II András}}, {{lang-hr|Andrija II.}}, {{lang-sk|Ondrej II.}}, {{lang-uk|Андрій II}}; {{circa}} 1177{{spaced ndash}}21 September 1235) was [[King of Hungary]] and [[King of Croatia|Croatia]] between 1205 and 1235, and reigned in the [[Principality of Halych]] from 1188 till 1189 or 1190, and between 1208 or 1209 and 1210, using the title king during the latter period. He was the younger son of [[Béla III of Hungary]], who invested him with the government of the [[Principality of Halych]]. His rule was unpopular and the [[boyar]]s expelled him. Béla III willed landed property and money to Andrew, obliging him to lead a [[crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]]. However, after his father's death in 1196, Andrew rose up in rebellion against his elder brother, [[Emeric of Hungary]], forcing him to cede [[Kingdom of Croatia (1102–1526)|Croatia]] and [[Dalmatia]] as appanage to him. In addition, Andrew occupied [[Zachlumia|Hum]].

Although during Emeric's reign Andrew rebelled against him twice, on his deathbed Emeric appointed Andrew guardian of his son, [[Ladislaus III of Hungary|Ladislaus]]. After the premature death of his nephew, Andrew mounted the throne in 1205. According to historian László Kontler, &quot;It was amindst the socio-political turmoil during his reign that the relations, arrangements, institutional framework and social categories that arose under Stephen I, started to disintegrate in the higher echelons of society&quot; in Hungary.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=75}} Andrew introduced a new policy of grants, the so-called &quot;new institutions&quot;, giving away money and royal estates to his partisans to the utter of royal revenues. Throughout his reign he waged wars to expand his suzerainty over the Principalities of Halych and [[Prince of Vladimir-in-Volhynia|Lodomeria]], but the [[boyar]]s and the neighboring [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] princes prevented him from achieving his goal. Nevertheless, he was the first Hungarian monarch to adopt the title &quot;King of Halych and Lodomeria&quot;. He led a crusade to the Holy Land in 1217-1218, but he achieved nothing.

A movement of the ''[[servientes regis]]'', or &quot;royal servants&quot;, forced him to issue the [[Golden Bull of 1222]], confirming their privileges, which gave rise to the development of the [[nobility in the Kingdom of Hungary]]. His ''[[Diploma Andreanum]]'' of 1224 spelled out the liberties of the community of the [[Transylvanian Saxons]]. The employment of [[Jews in Hungary|Jews]] and [[Böszörmény|Muslims]] in the administration of the royal revenues brought him into conflict with the [[Holy See]] and the Hungarian [[prelate]]s. Andrew pledged to respect the privileges of the clergymen and to dismiss his non-Christian officials in 1233, but he never fulfilled this latter promise.

Andrew married three times. His first wife, [[Gertrude of Merania]], whose blatant favoritism towards his German kinsmen and courtiers stirred up discontent among the native lords, was murdered in 1213. The veneration of their saintly daughters, [[Elizabeth of Hungary]], was confirmed by the Holy See in Andrew's lifetime. After Andrew's death, his sons, [[Béla IV of Hungary|Béla]] and [[Coloman of Galicia-Lodomeria|Coloman]], accused his third wife, [[Beatrice d'Este, Queen of Hungary|Beatrice D'Este]] of adultery and never considered her son, [[Stephen the Posthumous|Stephen]], as Andrew's legitimate son.

==Early life==

===Childhood and youth ({{circa}} 1177–1198)===
Andrew was the second son of King [[Béla III of Hungary|Béla III]] and his first wife, [[Agnes of Antioch]].{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=229, Appendix 4}} The year of his birth is not known, but he seems to have been born in about 1177, according to modern historians, including Gyula Kristó and Tibor Almási.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=229, Appendix 4}}{{sfn|Kristó|1994|p=43}}{{sfn|Almási|2012|p=86}} Being a younger son, Andrew could only succeede his father in case of the premature death of his elder brother, [[Emeric of Hungary|Emeric]], who was crowned king already in 1182, during their father's lifetime.{{sfn|Almási|2012|p=86}}{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=224}}

The first record of Andrew's life is connected to the invasion of the [[Principality of Halych]] by his father in 1188.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=229}} Béla III decided to launch a campaign against this [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] principality after its prince, [[Vladimir II Yaroslavich]], who had been dethroned by his subjects, fled to Hungary and sought his assistance.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=229}}{{sfn|Dimnik|2003|p=191}} Béla invaded Halych and forced its new prince, [[Roman Mstislavich]], to flee, but instead of restoring Vladimir Yaroslavich, he granted the principality to Andrew.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=224}}{{sfn|Dimnik|2003|pp=191, 193}} Béla also had Vladimir Yaroslavich captured and held him in captivity in Hungary.{{sfn|Dimnik|2003|p=193}}

Roman Mstislavich was the first Rus' prince to try to expel Andrew and his Hungarian retinue from Halych.{{sfn|Dimnik|2003|p=193}} Although he was supported by [[Rurik Rostislavich]], [[Prince of Belgorod Kievsky]], their united troops were routed by the Hungarians.{{sfn|Dimnik|2003|p=193}} Next a group of local [[boyar]]s offered the throne to [[Rostislav Ivanovich]], who was a distant cousin of the imprisoned Vladimir Yaroslavich.{{sfn|Dimnik|2003|p=193}} Béla III sent reinforcements to Halych, enabling his son's troops to repel the pretender's attack in 1189.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=127}} However, Andrew's reign remained unpopular in Halych, because the Hungarian soldiers insulted local women and did not respect [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches.{{sfn|Dimnik|2003|p=193}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=54}} After Vladimir Yaroslavich escaped from captivity and persuaded Duke [[Casimir II the Just|Casimir II of Poland]] to join him in invading Halych, the boyars assisted them in expelling Andrew and his retinue from the principality in August 1189 or 1190.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=122}}{{sfn|Berend|Urbańczyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=249}}{{sfn|Dimnik|2003|pp=193-194}}
  
Andrew returned to Hungary, but he only received estates and money from his father, who refrained from granting a whole province to his younger son.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=224}} On his deathbed, Béla III, who had pledged to lead a [[crusade]] to the [[Holy Land]], ordered Andrew to fulfil his vow.{{sfn|Berend|Urbańczyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=234}} Béla III, who died on 23 April 1196, was succeeded by Emeric.{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=30}} Andrew used his funds to recruit followers among the barons and made an alliance with [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria]] against his brother.{{sfn|Almási|2012|p=86}} Their united troops routed the royal army at Mački in Slavonia in December 1197, forcing King Emeric to grant [[Kingdom of Croatia (1102–1526)|Croatia]] and [[Dalmatia]] to Andrew as an appanage.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=124}}{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=347}}

===Duke of Croatia and Dalmatia (1198–1204)===

In practice, Andrew administered his duchies independently.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=347}}{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=22}} He minted coins, made land grants and confirmed privileges in Croatia and Dalmatia.{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=22}}{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=124}} He closely cooperated with the [[House of Frankopan|Frankopans]], the [[House of Babonić|Babonići]], and other local lords.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=347}} The [[Canons Regular of the Holy Sepulchre]] settled in the province during his reign.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=370}} Taking advantage of [[Miroslav of Hum]]'s death, Andrew invaded [[Zachlumia|Hum]] and occupied at least the regions between the rivers [[Cetina]] and [[Neretva]].{{sfn|Fine|1994|p=52}} Thereafter he styled himself &quot;By the grace of God, Duke of Zadar and of all Dalmatia, Croatia and Hum&quot; in his charters.{{sfn|Bárány|2012|p=132}}

[[Pope Innocent III]] urged Andrew to depart for the crusade on 29 January 1198, but he began conspiring against his brother.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=124}} The Pope menaced him with [[excommunication]], but he continued plotting with many prelates and lords, including [[John, Abbot of Pannonhalma]] and [[Boleslaus, Bishop of Vác]].{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|pp=124-125}} King Emeric seized letters written by the conspirators from Bishop Boleslaus on 10 March 1199.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=125}} The royal troops routed Andrew's army near the Lake Balaton in summer, forcing him to flee to Austria.{{sfn|Almási|2012|p=86}}{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=125}} A papal legate arrived in Hungary who brought about a reconciliation between the two brothers in summer 1200.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=125}} Andrew soon returned to his duchy.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=125}} Around this year, he married [[Gertrude of Merania]] whose father, [[Berthold, Duke of Merania]], owned extensive domains in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] along the borders of Andrew's duchy.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=347}}{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=125}}{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=230}}

The birth of Emeric's son, [[Ladislaus III of Hungary|Ladislaus]], around 1200, shattered Andrew's hopes to succeede his brother.{{sfn|Almási|2012|p=86}}{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=230}} Pope Innocent also confirmed the child's position as heir to the crown, and declared that Andrew's future sons were only entitled to inherit their father's duchy.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=230}}{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=125}} Andrew staged a new rebellion against his brother, but King Emeric captured him near [[Varaždin]] in October 1203.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=126}}

{{Quote|[All] the magnates of the kingdom and almost the whole of the Hungarian army deserted [King Emeric] and unlawfully sided with Duke Andrew. Very few men indeed remained with the king, and even they were terrified at the extent of the insurrection, and did not dare to urge the king to hope for success, but rather advised him to flee. Then it happened that one day both sides had drawn close to each other and were beginning to prepare themselves in earnest for battle. ... [After] much wise thought, with inspiration from heaven [King Emeric] found a successful way by which he might recover his right to the kingdom and still remain guiltless of bloodshed. So he said to his men, &quot;Stay here a while, and do not follow me.&quot; Then he laid down his weapons, and taking only a leafy bough in his hand he walked slowly into the enemy ranks. As he passed through the midst of the armed multitude, he cried out in a loud and strong voice, &quot;Now I shall see who will dare to raise a hand to shed the blood of the royal lineage!&quot; Seeing him, all fell back, and not daring even to mutter, they left a wide passage for him on either side. And then when [King Emeric] reached his brother, he took him, and leading him outside the body of troops, he sent him to a certain castle for custody.|[[Thomas the Archdeacon]]: ''History of the Bishops of Salona and Split''&lt;ref&gt;''Archdeacon Thomas of Split: History of the Bishops of Salona and Split'' (ch. 23.), pp. 141-143.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Andrew was held in captivity in the forts of Kene and [[Esztergom]].{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=126}}  A group of his partisans, including Alexander of the Hont-Pázmány clan, released him in early 1204.{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=30}}{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=126}} Emeric, who fell ill, had his four-year-old son crowned king on 26 August.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=89}} In short, the two brothers were reconciled and Emeric entrusted to Andrew &quot;the guardianship of his son and the administration of the entire kingdom until the ward should reach the age of majority&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''Archdeacon Thomas of Split: History of the Bishops of Salona and Split'' (ch. 23.), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; according to the nearly contemporaneous [[Thomas the Archdeacon]].{{sfn|Almási|2012|p=86}}

===His nephew's guardian (1204–1205)===

King Emeric died on 30 November 1204.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=89}} Although Andrew began governing as the guardian of his nephew, Ladislaus III, he counted his regnal years from his brother's death, showing that he regarded himself as the lawful monarch.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=89}} Pope Innocent III requested him to remain loyal to his nephew, but he even took hold of the money that his brother had deposited in the [[Pilis Abbey]] on behalf of the child Ladislaus.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|pp=227, 231}} The child king's mother, [[Constance of Aragon]], fled from Hungary, taking her son to [[Duchy of Austria|Austria]].{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=127}} Andrew made preparations to go to war against [[Leopold VI, Duke of Austria]], but the child king died in [[Vienna]] on 7 May 1205.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|pp=227-228}}

[[File:Andrew II of Hungary.jpg|thumb|right|190px|alt=A crowned man holding a flag in his left hand|Andrew II depicted in ''[[Chronicon Pictum|Illuminated Chronicle]]'']]
[[John, Archbishop of Esztergom|John, Archbishop of Kalocsa]] crowned Andrew king in Székesfehérvár on 29 May 1205.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=127}}{{sfn|Bartl|Čičaj|Kohútova|Letz|2002|p=31}} Andrew introduced a new policy of royal grants of landed property, which he called &quot;new institutions&quot;, or ''novæ institutiones'', in one of his charters.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=91}}{{sfn|Berend|Urbańczyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=427}} Stating that &quot;the best measure of a royal grant is its being immeasurable&quot;, he began distribute large parcels of the royal domain{{mdash}}royal castles and all estates attached to them{{mdash}}as inheritable grant to his partisans.{{sfn|Berend|Urbańczyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=427}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|pp=91-92}} His &quot;new institutions&quot; substantially altered the relations between the sovereign and the lords: in the previous two centuries, a lord's position had primarily depended on the income he received for his services to the monarch, hereafter they had their own revenues yielded by their inheritable estates.{{sfn|Kontler|1999|p=75}} The giving away of the castle lands also diminished the funds upon which the authority of the ''[[ispán]]s'', or heads, of the counties{{mdash}}who were appointed by the monarchs{{mdash}}had up to that time based.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=93}}

Andrew showed an intense interest in the internal affairs of his one-time principality, Halych, throughout his reign.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=89}} He launched his first campaign to Halych in 1205 or 1206.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=89}}{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=127}}{{sfn|Dimnik|2003|pp=251-253}} Upon the boyars' request, he intervened on behalf of [[Daniel of Galicia|Daniel Romanovich]], the child-prince of Halych and [[Prince of Vladimir-in-Volhynia|Lodomeria]] against [[Vsevolod Svyatoslavich]], [[Prince of Chernigov]], and his allies, forcing them to withdraw.{{sfn|Dimnik|2003|pp=253-254}}{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=127}} Andrew also adopted the title of &quot;King of Galicia and Lodomeria&quot;, demonstrating his claim to suzerainty in the region.{{sfn|Berend|Urbańczyk|Wiszewski|2013|p=441}}{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=317}} 
After his return to Hungary, Vsevolod Svyatoslavich's distant cousin, [[Vladimir III Igorevich|Vladimir Igorevich]], seized both Halych and Lodomeria, expelling the child Daniel Romanovich and his mother.{{sfn|Dimnik|2003|pp=254-255, 258}} They first fled to [[Leszek I of Poland]] who sent them to Andrew.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=127}}{{sfn|Dimnik|2003|p=263}} However, Vladimir Igorevich &quot;sent many gifts&quot; to both Andrew and Leszek, dissuating &quot;them from attacking him&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Hypatian Codex II: The Galician-Volynian Chronicle'' (year 1207), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; on behalf of the child prince, according to the ''[[Galician–Volhynian Chronicle]]''.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=127}}{{sfn|Dimnik|2003|p=263}} In the course of 1207, Andrew confirmed the liberties of two Dalmatian towns{{mdash}}Split and [[Omiš]]{{mdash}}and spelled out the privileges of the Archbishopric of Split in a new charter.{{sfn|Bárány|2012|p=136}}

In 1206 or 1208 Vladimir Igorevich's rebellious brother, [[Roman II Igorevich|Roman Igorevich]], arrived in Hungary, seeking Andrew's assistance.{{sfn|Dimnik|2003|p=263}} Roman Igorevich returned at the head of Hungarian reinforcements and forced his brother to leave Halych.{{sfn|Dimnik|2003|p=263}} Taking advantage of a lasting conflict between Roman Igorevich and his boyars, Andrew sent an army under the command of [[Benedict, son of Korlát]] to Halych, which captured the prince and occupied the whole principality in 1208 or 1209.{{sfn|Dimnik|2003|pp=263-264}}{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=128}} Instead of appointing a new prince, Andrew nominated Benedict to administer the principality on his behalf.{{sfn|Dimnik|2003|p=264}} In order to get rid of Benedict, who, as the ''Galician–Volhynian Chronicle'' writes, &quot;tortured boyars and was addicted to lechery&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''The Hypatian Codex II: The Galician-Volynian Chronicle'' (year 1210), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; the boyars offered the throne to [[Mstislav Mstislavich]], [[Prince of Zvenigorod]], but he could not defeat Andrew's governor.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=128}}

Andrew confirmed the privileges of the &quot;[[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxons]]&quot; inhabiting the wider region of [[Hermannstadt]] in southern Transylvania in a royal charter, known as ''[[Diploma Andreanum]]'', in 1224.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=403}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=114}} Next year he launched a campaign against the Teutonic Knights, who had attempted to get rid of his suzerainty, driving them out of the Barcaság and the neighboring regions.{{sfn|Curta|2006|p=403}}{{sfn|Spinei|2009|p=147}} To put an end to the armed conflicts along the borders of Hungary and Austria, Andrew's envoys and Leopold VI of Austria signed a peace treaty on 6 June, compelling the latter to pay an indemnification.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=138}} Andrew appointed his oldest son, Béla, [[Duke of Transylvania]] in 1226; Duke Béla soon set about expanding his suzerainty over the Cumans inhabiting the neighboring regions to the east of the Carpathian Mountains.{{sfn|Curta|2006|pp=405-405}}{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=95}} Andrew granted the provinces Béla had until that time administered to his second son, Coloman.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=138}}

In 1226 Andrew launched a campaign against Mstislav Mstislavich, who had granted [[Przemyśl]] instead of Halych to Andrew's youngest son.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=138}} He besieged and captured Przemyśl, [[Terebovl]], and other fortresses.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=138}} He was forced to withdraw from Halych after his troops were routed at [[Kremenets]] and Zvenigorod.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=138}} Nevertheless, Mstislav Mstislavich ceded Halych to Andrew's son in early 1227.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=138}}

Andrew authorized Duke Béla to revise his previous land grants in 1228.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=139}} The Duke's efforts were also supported by Pope Honorius.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=139}} Around the same time the Duke also confiscated the domains of two noblemen, [[Simon Kacsics]] and [[Bánk Bár-Kalán]], who had taken part in the conspiracy which ended with Queen Gertrude's murder.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=139}} Andrew confirmed the liberties of the Cuman chieftains who had subjected themselves to his son upon the latter's initiative in 1229.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=140}}

Andrew continued to employ non-Christians, prompting [[Robert, Archbishop of Esztergom]] to make a complaint against him to the Holy See.{{sfn|Berend|2006|p=155}} [[Pope Gregory IX]] authorized the Archbishop to apply acts of religious censure if it were necessary to persuade the monarch to change his policy.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=141}} The prelates forced Andrew to issue a new [[Golden Bull of 1231|Golden Bull]] in 1231.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=141}} This document repeated most provisions of the previous document, including the ban of the employment of Muslims by the monarch, and also empowered the Archbishop to excommunicate the King if he failed to respect the provisions of the Golden Bull.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=94}}{{sfn|Berend|2006|pp=154-155}} In the second half of the year, Andrew invaded Halych and restored his youngest son, Andrew, on the throne.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=141}}

Because of promoting the employment of Jews and Muslims, Archbishop Robert excommunicated Palatine Denis and a former head of a local chamber, and also put Hungary under [[interdict]] on 25 February 1232.{{sfn|Berend|2006|p=157}}{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=142}} The Archbishop declared that the Muslims had persuaded the monarch to withdraw donations from the Church.{{sfn|Berend|2006|p=157}} Andrew restored landed properties to the Archbishop who suspened the interdict within two months.{{sfn|Berend|2006|p=157}}{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=142}} Upon the King's demand, Pope Gregory dispatched Cardinal [[Giacomo Pecoraria]] as his legate to Hungary and promised that nobody would be excommunicated without his special authorization.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=142}} Upon the request of his youngest son, Andrew dispatched an army to protect his son's interests in Halych against Daniel Romanovich, but the Hungarian army was routed.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=143}} Andrew departed for a new campaign to Halych, but also continued his negotiations with the papal legate.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=143}} On 20 August 1233, Andrew swore an oath in the forests of [[Bereg County|Bereg]], promising that he would not employ Jews and Muslims in the administration of royal revenues and would pay 10,000 marks as compensation for usurped Church revenues.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=94}}{{sfn|Berend|2006|pp=158-159}} Andrew repeated his oath in [[Esztergom]] in September.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=143}}

To put an end to armed conflicts along the western borderlands, Andrew met [[Frederick II, Duke of Austria]] in [[Wiener Neustadt]] and in Hungary, persuading him to sign a peace treaty in late 1233.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=143}} The widowed Andrew married the 23-year-old [[Beatrice d'Este, Queen of Hungary|Beatrice D'Este]] on 14 May 1234, although his sons and daughter-in-laws opposed his third marriage.{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=243}} Cardinal Pecoraria had already left Hungary, but authorized Archbishop Robert and John, Bishop of Bosnia to apply ecclesiastic censure if the monarch did not act in accordance with his [[oath of Bereg]].{{sfn|Berend|2006|p=159}} For Andrew did not dismiss his non-Christian officials, Bishop John put Hungary under a new interdict in the first half of 1234.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=144}} Andrew and Archbishop Robert jointly protested against the Bishop's act.{{sfn|Berend|2006|p=160}}

===Last years (1234–1235)===
Prince Danylo laid siege to Halych and Andrew's youngest son died during the siege in the autumn of 1234.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=144}} In retaliation for a raid into Hungary by Duke Frederick II, Andrew stormed into Austria in summer 1235, forcing the Duke to pay an indemnification.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=144}} Pope Gregor declared that Andrew and his sons could only be excommunicated with a previous authorization by the Holy See on 31 August.{{sfn|Érszegi|Solymosi|1981|p=144}} Andrew died on 21 September.{{sfn|Engel|2001|p=98}} He was buried in the [[Egres Abbey]].{{sfn|Kristó|Makk|1996|p=244}}
