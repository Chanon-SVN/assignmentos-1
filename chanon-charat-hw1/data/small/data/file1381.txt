The first pharmaceutical amphetamine was [[Benzedrine]], a brand of inhalers used to treat a variety of conditions.  Currently, pharmaceutical amphetamine is typically prescribed as [[Adderall]],{{#tag:ref|&quot;Adderall&quot; is a [[brand name]] as opposed to a nonproprietary name; because the latter (&quot;''dextroamphetamine sulfate, dextroamphetamine saccharate, amphetamine sulfate, and amphetamine aspartate''&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NDCD&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = National Drug Code Amphetamine Search Results | url = http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ndc/results.cfm?beginrow=1&amp;numberperpage=160&amp;searchfield=amphetamine&amp;searchtype=ActiveIngredient&amp;OrderBy=ProprietaryName | work = National Drug Code Directory|publisher=United States Food and Drug Administration | accessdate = 16 December 2013 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20131216080856/http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ndc/results.cfm?beginrow=1&amp;numberperpage=160&amp;searchfield=amphetamine&amp;searchtype=ActiveIngredient&amp;OrderBy=ProprietaryName | archivedate = 7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is excessively long, this article exclusively refers to this amphetamine mixture by the brand name.|name=&quot;Adderall&quot;| group=&quot;note&quot;}} dextroamphetamine, or the inactive [[prodrug]] [[lisdexamfetamine]]. Amphetamine, through activation of a [[TAAR1|trace amine receptor]], increases [[biogenic amine]] and [[Neurotransmitter#Excitatory and inhibitory|excitatory neurotransmitter]] activity in the brain, with its most pronounced effects targeting the [[catecholamine]] neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine. At therapeutic doses, this causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in libido, increased wakefulness, and improved [[cognitive control]]. It induces physical effects such as decreased reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength.{{#tag:ref|&lt;ref name=&quot;Adderall IR&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ergogenics&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Malenka_2009&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Libido&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amph Uses&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Benzedrine&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FDA Effects&quot; /&gt;|group=&quot;sources&quot;}}

Much larger doses of amphetamine are likely to impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown. [[Addiction|Drug addiction]] is a serious risk with large recreational doses, but rarely arises from medical use. Very high doses can result in [[Stimulant psychosis#Amphetamines|psychosis]] (e.g., delusions and paranoia) which rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long-term use. Recreational doses are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses and carry a far greater risk of serious side effects.{{#tag:ref|&lt;ref name=&quot;FDA Abuse &amp; OD&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Malenka_2009&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cochrane&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stimulant Misuse&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EncycOfPsychopharm&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Westfall&quot; /&gt;|group=&quot;sources&quot;}}

Amphetamine is also the parent compound of its own structural class, the [[substituted amphetamine]]s,{{#tag:ref|Due to confusion that may arise from use of the plural form, this article will only use the terms &quot;amphetamine&quot; and &quot;amphetamines&quot; to refer to racemic amphetamine, levoamphetamine, and dextroamphetamine and reserve the term &quot;substituted amphetamines&quot; for the class.|group=&quot;note&quot;}} which includes prominent substances such as [[bupropion]], [[cathinone]], [[MDMA|MDMA (ecstasy)]], and [[methamphetamine]]. As a member of the phenethylamine class, amphetamine is also chemically related to the naturally occurring [[trace amine]] neuromodulators, specifically [[phenethylamine]]{{#tag:ref|Again, due to confusion that may arise from use of the plural form, this article will only use &quot;phenethylamine&quot; and &quot;phenethylamines&quot; to refer to the compound itself and reserve the term &quot;substituted phenethylamines&quot; for the class.|group=&quot;note&quot;}} and {{nowrap|[[N-methylphenethylamine|''N''-methylphenethylamine]]}}, both of which are produced within the human body. Phenethylamine is the parent compound of amphetamine, while ''N''-methylphenethylamine is a [[constitutional isomer]] that differs only in the placement of the methyl group.{{#tag:ref|&lt;ref name=&quot;EMC&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Amphetamine | url = http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/publications/drug-profiles/amphetamine | work = European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction | accessdate = 19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Trace Amines&quot; /&gt;|group=&quot;sources&quot;}}

Over the past two decades, research has progressed from identifying ΔFosB induction to investigating its subsequent action (38). It is likely that ΔFosB research will now progress into a new era – the use of ΔFosB as a biomarker. If ΔFosB detection is indicative of chronic drug exposure (and is at least partly responsible for dependence of the substance), then its monitoring for therapeutic efficacy in interventional studies is a suitable biomarker (Figure 2). Examples of therapeutic avenues are discussed herein.&amp;nbsp;...&lt;br /&gt;Conclusions&lt;br /&gt;ΔFosB is an essential transcription factor implicated in the molecular and behavioral pathways of addiction following repeated drug exposure. The formation of ΔFosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for ΔFosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of ΔFosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of ΔFosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a ‘‘molecular switch’’ (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of ΔFosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75). However, it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments, which are much needed in addiction.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there are currently no effective drugs for treating amphetamine addiction, regularly engaging in sustained aerobic exercise appears to reduce the risk of developing such an addiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Running vs addiction&quot; /&gt; Sustained aerobic exercise on a regular basis also appears to be an effective treatment for amphetamine addiction;&lt;ref name=&quot;Natural and drug addictions&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Running vs addiction&quot; /&gt; exercise therapy improves [[wikt:clinical|clinical]] treatment outcomes and may be used as a [[combination therapy]] with [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], which is currently the best clinical treatment available.&lt;ref name=&quot;Running vs addiction&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nestler CBT&quot;/&gt;

Together, these findings demonstrate that drugs of abuse and natural reward behaviors act on common molecular and cellular mechanisms of plasticity that control vulnerability to drug addiction, and that this increased vulnerability is mediated by ΔFosB and its downstream transcriptional targets.&amp;nbsp;... Sexual behavior is highly rewarding (Tenk et al., 2009), and sexual experience causes sensitized drug-related behaviors, including cross-sensitization to amphetamine (Amph)-induced locomotor activity (Bradley and Meisel, 2001; Pitchers et al., 2010a) and enhanced Amph reward (Pitchers et al., 2010a). Moreover, sexual experience induces neural plasticity in the NAc similar to that induced by psychostimulant exposure, including increased dendritic spine density (Meisel and Mullins, 2006; Pitchers et al., 2010a), altered glutamate receptor trafficking, and decreased synaptic strength in prefrontal cortex-responding NAc shell neurons (Pitchers et al., 2012). Finally, periods of abstinence from sexual experience were found to be critical for enhanced Amph reward, NAc spinogenesis (Pitchers et al., 2010a), and glutamate receptor trafficking (Pitchers et al., 2012).

Exercise also produces neuroadaptations that may influence an individual's vulnerability to initiate drug use. Consistent with this idea, chronic moderate levels of forced treadmill running blocks not only subsequent methamphetamine-induced conditioned place preference, but also stimulant-induced increases in dopamine release in the {{abbr|NAc|nucleus accumbens}} (Chen et al., 2008) and striatum (Marques et al., 2008).&amp;nbsp;... [These] findings indicate the efficacy of exercise at reducing drug intake in drug-dependent individuals&amp;nbsp;... wheel running [reduces] methamphetamine self-administration under extended access conditions (Engelmann et al., 2013)&amp;nbsp;... These findings suggest that exercise may &quot;magnitude&quot;-dependently prevent the development of an addicted phenotype possibly by blocking/reversing behavioral and neuro-adaptive changes that develop during and following extended access to the drug.&amp;nbsp;... Exercise has been proposed as a treatment for drug addiction that may reduce drug craving and risk of relapse. Although few clinical studies have investigated the efficacy of exercise for preventing relapse, the few studies that have been conducted generally report a reduction in drug craving and better treatment outcomes (see Table 4).&amp;nbsp;... Taken together, these data suggest that the potential benefits of exercise during relapse, particularly for relapse to psychostimulants, may be mediated via chromatin remodeling and possibly lead to greater treatment outcomes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exercise leads to better treatment outcomes when used as an adjunct treatment, particularly for psychostimulant addictions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Running vs addiction&quot; /&gt; In particular, [[aerobic exercise]] decreases psychostimulant self-administration, reduces the [[reinstatement]] (i.e., relapse) of drug-seeking, and induces increased [[dopamine receptor D2|dopamine receptor D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] (DRD2) density in the [[striatum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Natural and drug addictions&quot; /&gt; This is the opposite of pathological stimulant use, which induces decreased striatal DRD2 density.&lt;ref name=&quot;Natural and drug addictions&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Olsen CM | title = Natural rewards, neuroplasticity, and non-drug addictions | journal = Neuropharmacology | volume = 61 | issue = 7 | pages = 1109–1122 |date=December 2011  | pmid = 21459101 | pmc = 3139704 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.03.010 | quote = Similar to environmental enrichment, studies have found that exercise reduces self-administration and relapse to drugs of abuse (Cosgrove et al., 2002; Zlebnik et al., 2010). There is also some evidence that these preclinical findings translate to human populations, as exercise reduces withdrawal symptoms and relapse in abstinent smokers (Daniel et al., 2006; Prochaska et al., 2008), and one drug recovery program has seen success in participants that train for and compete in a marathon as part of the program (Butler, 2005).&amp;nbsp;... In humans, the role of dopamine signaling in incentive-sensitization processes has recently been highlighted by the observation of a dopamine dysregulation syndrome in some patients taking dopaminergic drugs. This syndrome is characterized by a medication-induced increase in (or compulsive) engagement in non-drug rewards such as gambling, shopping, or sex (Evans et al., 2006; Aiken, 2007; Lader, 2008).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Withdrawal====

According to another Cochrane Collaboration review on [[drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] in individuals who compulsively use amphetamine and methamphetamine, &quot;when chronic heavy users abruptly discontinue amphetamine use, many report a time-limited withdrawal syndrome that occurs within 24&amp;nbsp;hours of their last dose.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cochrane Withdrawal&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shoptaw SJ, Kao U, Heinzerling K, Ling W | title = Treatment for amphetamine withdrawal | journal = Cochrane Database Syst.

The severity of withdrawal symptoms is greater in amphetamine dependent individuals who are older and who have more extensive amphetamine use disorders (McGregor 2005). Withdrawal symptoms typically present within 24 hours of the last use of amphetamine, with a withdrawal syndrome involving two general phases that can last 3 weeks or more.

====Dopamine====

In certain brain regions, amphetamine increases the concentration of dopamine in the [[synaptic cleft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller&quot; /&gt; Amphetamine can enter the [[presynaptic neuron]] either through {{abbr|DAT|dopamine transporter}} or by diffusing across the neuronal membrane directly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller&quot; /&gt; As a consequence of DAT uptake, amphetamine produces competitive reuptake inhibition at the transporter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller&quot; /&gt; Upon entering the presynaptic neuron, amphetamine activates {{abbr|TAAR1|trace amine-associated receptor 1}} which, through [[protein kinase A]] (PKA) and [[protein kinase C]] (PKC) signaling, causes DAT [[phosphorylation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller&quot; /&gt; Phosphorylation by either protein kinase can result in DAT [[endocytosis|internalization]] ({{nowrap|non-competitive}} reuptake inhibition), but {{nowrap|PKC-mediated}} phosphorylation alone induces reverse transporter function (dopamine [[wikt:efflux|efflux]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TAAR1 Review&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Maguire JJ, Parker WA, Foord SM, Bonner TI, Neubig RR, Davenport AP | title = International Union of Pharmacology.

====Norepinephrine====

Similar to dopamine, amphetamine dose-dependently increases the level of synaptic norepinephrine, the direct precursor of [[epinephrine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Trace Amines&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cognition enhancers&quot; /&gt; Based upon neuronal {{abbr|TAAR1|trace amine-associated receptor 1}} {{abbr|mRNA|messenger RNA}} expression, amphetamine is thought to affect norepinephrine analogously to dopamine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;E Weihe&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TAAR1 Review&quot; /&gt; In other words, amphetamine induces TAAR1-mediated efflux and {{nowrap|non-competitive}} reuptake inhibition at phosphorylated {{abbr|NET|norepinephrine transporter}}, competitive NET reuptake inhibition, and norepinephrine release from {{abbr|VMAT2|vesicular monoamine transporter 2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;E Weihe&quot; /&gt;

====Serotonin====

Amphetamine exerts analogous, yet less pronounced, effects on serotonin as on dopamine and norepinephrine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cognition enhancers&quot; /&gt; Amphetamine affects serotonin via {{abbr|VMAT2|vesicular monoamine transporter 2}} and, like norepinephrine, is thought to phosphorylate {{abbr|SERT|serotonin transporter}} via {{abbr|TAAR1|trace amine-associated receptor 1}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;E Weihe&quot; /&gt;

====Other neurotransmitters====

Amphetamine has no direct effect on [[acetylcholine]] neurotransmission, but several studies have noted that acetylcholine release increases after its use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Acetylcholine&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MEDRS-Cholinergic&quot; /&gt; In lab animals, amphetamine increases acetylcholine levels in certain brain regions as a downstream effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Acetylcholine&quot; /&gt;  In humans, a similar phenomenon occurs via the [[ghrelin]]-mediated [[cholinergic–dopaminergic reward link]] in the [[ventral tegmental area]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MEDRS-Cholinergic&quot; /&gt; This heightened [[cholinergic]] activity leads to increased [[nicotinic receptor]] activation in the {{abbr|CNS|central nervous system}}, a factor which likely contributes to the [[nootropic]] effects of amphetamine.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21334367&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Levin ED, Bushnell PJ, Rezvani AH | title = Attention-modulating effects of cognitive enhancers | journal = Pharmacol.

===Pharmacokinetics===

The oral [[bioavailability]] of amphetamine varies with gastrointestinal pH;&lt;ref name=&quot;FDA Interactions&quot; /&gt; it is well absorbed from the gut, and bioavailability is typically over&amp;nbsp;75% for dextroamphetamine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drugbank-dexamph&quot; /&gt; Amphetamine is a weak base with a [[Acid dissociation constant|pKa]] of {{nowrap|9–10}};&lt;ref name=&quot;FDA Pharmacokinetics&quot; /&gt; consequently, when the pH is basic, more of the drug is in its [[lipid]] soluble [[free base]] form, and more is absorbed through the lipid-rich [[cell membranes]] of the gut [[epithelium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FDA Pharmacokinetics&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FDA Interactions&quot; /&gt; Conversely, an acidic pH means the drug is predominantly in a water soluble [[cation]]ic (salt) form, and less is absorbed.&lt;ref name=&quot;FDA Pharmacokinetics&quot; /&gt; Approximately {{nowrap|15–40%}} of amphetamine circulating in the bloodstream is bound to [[plasma protein]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drugbank-amph&quot; /&gt;

Amphetamine is a [[methyl]] [[homologous series|homolog]] of the mammalian neurotransmitter phenethylamine with the chemical formula {{chemical formula|C|9|H|13|N}}.  The carbon atom adjacent to the [[primary amine]] is a [[stereogenic center]], and amphetamine is composed of a [[racemic]] 1:1 mixture of two [[enantiomer]]ic mirror images.&lt;ref name=&quot;DrugBank1&quot; /&gt;  This racemic mixture can be separated into its optical isomers:{{#tag:ref|Enantiomers are molecules that are mirror images of one another; they are structurally identical, but of the opposite orientation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enantiomers&quot; /&gt;|group = &quot;note&quot;}} [[levoamphetamine]] and [[dextroamphetamine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DrugBank1&quot; /&gt; Physically, at room temperature, the pure free base of amphetamine is a mobile, colorless, and [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] [[liquid]] with a characteristically strong [[amine]] odor, and acrid, burning taste.&lt;ref name=&quot;Properties&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Amphetamine | section-url=http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=3007#section=Chemical-and-Physical-Properties | work=PubChem Compound | publisher = National Center for Biotechnology Information | accessdate=13 October 2013 | section=Chemical and Physical Properties }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frequently prepared solid salts of amphetamine include amphetamine aspartate,&lt;ref name=&quot;FDA Abuse &amp; OD&quot; /&gt; hydrochloride,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Amphetamine Hydrochloride | url=http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=92939 | work = Pubchem Compound | publisher = National Center for Biotechnology Information | accessdate = 8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; phosphate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Amphetamine Phosphate | url=http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/summary/summary.cgi?cid=62885 | work=Pubchem Compound | publisher = National Center for Biotechnology Information | accessdate=8 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; saccharate,&lt;ref name=&quot;FDA Abuse &amp; OD&quot; /&gt; and sulfate,&lt;ref name=&quot;FDA Abuse &amp; OD&quot; /&gt; the last of which is the most common amphetamine salt.&lt;ref name=&quot;EMC&quot; /&gt; Amphetamine is also the parent compound of [[Substituted amphetamine|its own structural class]], which includes a number of psychoactive [[derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DrugBank1&quot; /&gt; In organic chemistry, amphetamine is an excellent [[chiral ligand]] for the [[stereoselective synthesis]] of {{nowrap|[[1,1'-bi-2-naphthol]]}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chiral Ligand&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brussee J, Jansen ACA | year = 1983 | title = A highly stereoselective synthesis of s(-)-[1,1'-binaphthalene]-2,2'-diol | journal = Tetrahedron Lett. | volume = 24 | issue = 31 | pages = 3261–3262 | doi = 10.1016/S0040-4039(00)88151-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthesis===
{{Details3|[[History and culture of substituted amphetamines#Illegal synthesis|Illegal synthesis of substituted amphetamines]]|illicit amphetamine synthesis}}
Since the first preparation was reported in 1887,&lt;ref name=&quot;Vermont&quot;/&gt; numerous synthetic routes to amphetamine have been developed.&lt;ref name = &quot;Allen_Cantrell_1989&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Allen A, Cantrell TS | title = Synthetic reductions in clandestine amphetamine and methamphetamine laboratories: A review | journal = Forensic Science International | date = August 1989 | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 183–199 | doi = 10.1016/0379-0738(89)90086-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Allen_Ely_2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.nwafs.org/newsletters/2011_Spring.pdf | title = Review: Synthetic Methods for Amphetamine | author = Allen A, Ely R | format = PDF | work = | publisher = Northwest Association of Forensic Scientists | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | year = 2009 | pages = 15–25 | journal = Crime Scene | accessdate = 6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these syntheses are based on classic organic reactions.  One such example is the [[Friedel–Crafts reaction#Friedel–Crafts alkylation|Friedel–Crafts]] alkylation of [[chlorobenzene]] by [[allyl chloride]] to yield beta chloropropylbenzene which is then reacted with ammonia to produce racemic amphetamine (method 1).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20985610&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Patrick TM, McBee ET, Hass HB | title = Synthesis of arylpropylamines; from allyl chloride | journal = J.

In this route, [[allylbenzene]] is reacted [[acetonitrile]] in sulfuric acid to yield an [[organosulfate]] which in turn is treated with sodium hydroxide to give amphetamine via an [[acetamide]] intermediate.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18105933&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ritter JJ, Kalish J | title = A new reaction of nitriles; synthesis of t-carbinamines | journal = J.

This synthetic intermediate can be transformed into amphetamine using either a [[Hofmann rearrangement|Hofmann]] or [[Curtius rearrangement]] (method 3).&lt;ref name = &quot;US2413493&quot;&gt;{{ cite patent  | country = US  | number = 2413493  | status = patent  | title = Synthesis of isomer-free benzyl methyl acetoacetic methyl ester  | pubdate =  31 December 1946 | fdate = 3 June 1943  | pridate = 3 June 1943 | inventor = Bitler WP, Flisik AC, Leonard N | assign1 = Kay Fries Chemicals Inc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant number of amphetamine syntheses feature a [[Organic redox reaction#Organic reductions|reduction]] of a [[nitro group|nitro]], [[imine]], [[oxime]] or other nitrogen-containing [[functional group]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Allen_Cantrell_1989&quot;/&gt;  In one such example, a [[Knoevenagel condensation]] of [[benzaldehyde]] with [[nitroethane]] yields {{nowrap|[[phenyl-2-nitropropene]]}}.  The double bond and nitro group of this intermediate is [[organic redox reaction|reduced]] using either catalytic [[hydrogenation]] or by treatment with [[lithium aluminium hydride]] (method 4).&lt;ref name=&quot;Delta Isotope&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Collins M, Salouros H, Cawley AT, Robertson J, Heagney AC, Arenas-Queralt A | title = δ&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C and δ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H isotope ratios in amphetamine synthesized from benzaldehyde and nitroethane | journal = Rapid Commun.

The most common route of both legal and illicit amphetamine synthesis employs a non-metal reduction known as the [[Leuckart reaction]] (method 6).&lt;ref name=&quot;EMC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amph Synth&quot; /&gt;  In the first step, a reaction between phenylacetone and [[formamide]], either using additional [[formic acid]] or formamide itself as a reducing agent, yields {{nowrap|[[N-formylamphetamine|''N''-formylamphetamine]]}}.  This intermediate is then hydrolyzed using hydrochloric acid, and subsequently basified, extracted with organic solvent, concentrated, and distilled to yield the free base. The free base is then dissolved in an organic solvent, sulfuric acid added, and amphetamine precipitates out as the sulfate salt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amph Synth&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jo01145a001 | title = The Mechanism of the Leuckart Reaction |date=May 1951 | author = Pollard CB, Young DC | journal = J. Org. Chem. | volume = 16 | issue = 5 | pages = 661–672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[chiral resolution]]s have been developed to separate the two enantiomers of amphetamine.&lt;ref name = &quot;Allen_Ely_2009&quot;/&gt; For example, racemic amphetamine can be treated with {{nowrap|d-[[tartaric acid]]}} to form a [[diastereoisomer]]ic salt which is [[fractional crystallization (chemistry)|fractionally]] crystallized to yield dextroamphetamine.&lt;ref name = &quot;US2276508&quot;&gt;{{ cite patent  | country = US  | number = 2276508  | status = patent  | title = Method for the separation of optically active alpha-methylphenethylamine  | pubdate = 17 March 1942  | fdate = 3 November 1939  | pridate = 3 November 1939  | inventor = Nabenhauer FP  | assign1 = Smith Kline French }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiral resolution remains the most economical method for obtaining optically pure amphetamine on a large scale.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gray_2007&quot;/&gt; In addition, several [[enantioselective synthesis|enantioselective]] syntheses of amphetamine have been developed. In one example, [[optically pure]] {{nowrap|(''R'')-1-phenyl-ethanamine}} is condensed with phenylacetone to yield a chiral [[schiff base]].  In the key step, this intermediate is reduced by [[catalytic hydrogenation]] with a transfer of chirality to the carbon atom alpha to the amino group.  Cleavage of the [[benzylic]] amine bond by hydrogenation yields optically pure dextroamphetamine.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gray_2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite book  | editor = Johnson DS, Li JJ | author = Gray DL | title = The Art of Drug Synthesis | chapter = Approved Treatments for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: Amphetamine (Adderall), Methylphenidate (Ritalin), and Atomoxetine (Straterra) | chapterurl = http://books.google.com/books?id=zvruBDAulWEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20Art%20of%20Drug%20Synthesis%20(Wiley%20Series%20on%20Drug%20Synthesis)&amp;pg=SA17-PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=amphetamine&amp;f=false | year = 2007 | publisher = Wiley-Interscience | location = New York, USA | isbn = 9780471752158 | page = 247 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
