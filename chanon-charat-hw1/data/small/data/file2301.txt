==Geography and climate==
[[File:NiagaraRiverNASA.jpg|thumb|2001 image of [[Southern Ontario]], [[Niagara Falls]] and Buffalo from a [[NASA]]'s Terra satellite. ]]
Buffalo is located on the eastern end of [[Lake Erie]], opposite [[Fort Erie, Ontario]], and at the beginning of the [[Niagara River]], which flows northward over [[Niagara Falls]] and into [[Lake Ontario]]. The city is 50 miles south-southeast from [[Toronto]]. Buffalo's position on Lake Erie, facing westward, makes it one of the only major cities on the East Coast to have sunsets over a body of water.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|52.5|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|40.6|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|11.9|sqmi|km2}} is water. The total area is 22.66% water.

Buffalo has a reputation for snowy winters, but it is rarely the [[Golden Snowball Award|snowiest city in New York State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldensnowball.com/yearly-winners-golden-award.htm|author=Madsen, Steve|title=Comparison Golden Snowball City Stats 1940 – 2007|publisher=Goldensnowball|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140208002625/http://www.goldensnowball.com/yearly-winners-golden-award.htm|archivedate=February 8, 2014}}, Retrieved 2013-5-31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weatherbug.excite.com/StormCentral/Excite/StormCentral.aspx?no_cookie_zip=90012&amp;no_cookie_stat=LNFR3&amp;no_cookie_world_stat=&amp;zcode=z4639&amp;story_id=6117&amp;lid=SCSPS|date=January 3, 2012|author=WeatherBug Meteorologists|title=What Are The Snowiest Cities in the U.S.?|publisher=Weatherbug}}, Retrieved 2013-5-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Winters in Western New York are generally cold and [[snowstorm|snowy]], but are changeable and include frequent thaws and rain as well. Snow covers the ground more often than not from late December into early March, but periods of bare ground are not uncommon. Over half of the annual snowfall comes from the [[lake effect snow|lake effect]] process and is very localized. Lake effect snow occurs when cold air crosses the relatively warm lake waters and becomes saturated, creating clouds and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] downwind. Due to the prevailing winds, areas south of Buffalo receive much more lake effect snow than locations to the north. The lake's &quot;snow machine&quot; starts as early as mid-November, peaks in December, then virtually shuts down after [[Lake Erie]] freezes in mid-to-late January. The most well-known snowstorm in Buffalo's history, the [[Blizzard of 1977|Blizzard of '77]], was not a lake effect snowstorm in Buffalo in the normal sense of that term (Lake Erie was frozen over at the time), but instead resulted from a combination of high winds and snow previously accumulated both on land and on frozen Lake Erie. Snow does not typically impair the city's operation, but can cause significant damage during the autumn as with the [[Lake Storm &quot;Aphid&quot;|October 2006 storm]], colloquially known as the &quot;October Surprise.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.wistv.com/story/5534235/buffalo-socked-by-wintry-october-surprise|title = Buffalo socked by wintry October surprise|last = |first = |date = October 13, 2006|work = WISTV|accessdate = September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://archive.wgrz.com/news/photo-gallery.aspx?storyid=229120|title = October Surprise Storm: 7th Anniversary|date = |accessdate = |website = WGRZ|publisher = Gannett|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014 the region experienced a record-breaking storm with [[thundersnow]] which killed at least eight people, flattened roofs and dumped over {{convert|6|ft}} of snow in some locations—stranding motorists, triggering a driving ban and forcing a change in venue for a scheduled [[American football|football]] game between the [[Buffalo Bills]] and the [[New York Jets]].&lt;ref name=TerraDaily-2014-11-19&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.terradaily.com/reports/At_least_eight_dead_in_historic_US_snowstorm_999.html |title= At least eight dead in 'historic' US snowstorm |date= 19 November 2014 |publisher= Terra Daily |author= AFP }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CBSroofs&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/deadly-snowstorms-cause-roof-collapses-in-buffalo-area/|title=Deadly snowstorms cause roof collapses in Buffalo area|publisher=[[CBS News]] &amp; [[Associated Press]]|date=November 20, 2014|accessdate=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By November 21, the estimated death toll had increased to 12 and flooding was reported as a major concern with reports of an impending warm-up.

Buffalo has the sunniest and driest summers of any major city in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], but still has enough rain to keep vegetation green and lush.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erh.noaa.gov/buf/bufclifo.htm Buffalo's Climate].

It receives, on average, over 65% of possible sunshine in June, July and August. Obscured by the notoriety of Buffalo's winter snow is the fact that Buffalo benefits from other lake effects such as the cooling southwest breezes off Lake Erie in summer that gently temper the warmest days.

The stabilizing effect of Lake Erie continues to inhibit [[thunderstorms]] and enhance sunshine in the immediate Buffalo area through most of July.

Like most formerly industrial cities of the [[Great Lakes]] region in the United States, Buffalo has experienced an economic depression brought about by the loss of its industrial base. The city's population peaked in 1950, when it was the 15th largest city in the United States and its population has declined every census since then. The demographic change and the impact of such change on the industrial cities of the region, including Buffalo, is significant; based on the 2006 US Census estimate, Buffalo's current population is equivalent to its population in the year 1890, reversing 120 years of demographic change.

At the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]], the city's population was 50.4% White (45.8% non-Hispanic White alone), 38.6% Black or African-American, 0.8% American Indian and Alaska Native, 3.2% Asian, 3.9% from some other race and 3.1% from two or more races. 10.5% of the total population was Hispanic or Latino of any race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/36/3611000.html |title=Buffalo Demographics: 2010 |publisher=quickfacts.census.go |accessdate=November 8, 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140504172555/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/36/3611000.html |archivedate=May 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the 2000 census there were 292,648 people, 122,720 households, and 67,005 [[family|families]] residing in the city. The population density is 7,205.8 people per square mile (2,782.4/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). There are 145,574 [[house|housing]] units at an average density of 3,584.4 per square mile (1,384.1/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The [[Race (U.S. Census)|racial]] makeup of the city is 54.43% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 37.23% African-American, 0.77% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 1.40% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.04% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 3.68% from other races, and 2.45% from two or more races. 7.54% of the population are [[Hispanics in the United States|Hispanic]] or Latino of any race. The top 5 largest ancestries include [[German American|German]] (13.6%), [[Irish American|Irish]] (12.2%), [[Italian American|Italian]] (11.7%), [[Polish American|Polish]] (11.7%), and [[English American|English]] (4.0%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/city/Buffalo-New-York.html |title=Buffalo, New York (NY) Detailed Profile – relocation, real estate, travel, jobs, hospitals, schools, crime, news, sex offenders |publisher=City-data.com |date= |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130927162849/http://www.city-data.com:80/city/Buffalo-New-York.html |archivedate=September 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 122,720 households out of which 28.6% have children under the age of 18 living with them, 27.6% are married couples living together, 22.3% have a female householder with no husband present, and 45.4% are non-families. 37.7% of all households are made up of individuals and 12.1% have someone living alone who is 65 years of age or older. The average household size is 2.29 and the average family size is 3.07.

In the city the population included 26.3% under the age of 18, 11.3% from 18 to 24, 29.3% from 25 to 44, 19.6% from 45 to 64, and 13.4% who are 65 years of age or older. The median age is 34 years.

Buffalo has very sizable populations of Irish, Italian, Polish, German, [[Jewish American|Jewish]], [[Greek American|Greek]], [[Arab American|Arab]], African-American, [[Indian American|Indian]], [[Macedonian American|Macedonian]], and [[Puerto Rican American|Puerto Rican]] descent. Major ethnic neighborhoods still exist but they changed significantly in the second half of the 20th century.

The East Side is now a predominantly African-American neighborhood, while the West Side has become a [[melting pot]] of many ethnicities, with Latino culture being the strongest influence. Throughout the history of Buffalo, the neighborhoods collectively called the First Ward, as well as much of [[South Buffalo]], have comprised almost entirely people of [[Irish descent]]. Recently, there has been an influx of inhabitants that are of Arab descent, mainly from Yemen, as the city's [[Muslim]] population has increased to approximately 3,000 according to an estimate.&lt;ref&gt;http://wings.buffalo.edu/sa/muslim/LocalMosques.htm  {{Wayback|url=http://wings.buffalo.edu/sa/muslim/LocalMosques.htm|date =20100212075820}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1950s and 1960s, the greater portion of the Jewish population has moved to the suburban areas outside of the city, or to the city's upper West Side.

In a 2008 United Nations report entitled ''State of the World's Cities'', figures from the Buffalo-Niagara Falls metropolitan area were used to show economic and racial inequality throughout the world.

Buffalo and the surrounding region is home to two major league [[professional sports]] teams. The [[Buffalo Sabres]] of the [[NHL]] play in the City of Buffalo, and the [[Buffalo Bills]] of the [[NFL]] play in the suburb of [[Orchard Park, New York]]. Buffalo is also home to several minor sports teams including the [[Buffalo Bisons]] ([[baseball]]), [[Buffalo Bandits]] ([[Box lacrosse|indoor lacrosse]]) and [[FC Buffalo]] ([[Association football|soccer]]). Several Buffalo-area colleges and universities are active in college athletics.

The Buffalo Bills, established in 1959, played in [[War Memorial Stadium (Buffalo)|War Memorial Stadium]] until 1973, when Ralph Wilson Stadium was constructed. The team competes in the [[AFC East]] division. Since the [[AFL–NFL merger]] in 1970, the Bills have won the division title seven times (1980, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1995), and the [[American Football Conference|AFC]] conference championship four consecutive times (1990, 1991, 1992, 1993), resulting in four lost [[Super Bowl]]s.

The Buffalo Sabres, established in 1970, played in [[War Memorial Auditorium]] until 1996, when [[Marine Midland Arena]], now First Niagara Center, opened. The team is within the [[Atlantic Division (NHL)|Atlantic Division of the NHL]]. The team has won six division titles, one [[Presidents' Trophy]] (2006–07) and three conference championships (1974–75, 1979–80, 1998–99). However, like the Buffalo Bills, the team does not have a league championship.

The Buffalo Bandits, established in 1992, played home games in War Memorial Auditorium until their move to Marine Midland Arena. They have won eight division championships and four league championships (1992, 1993, 1996, 2008).

==Parks and recreation==
{{Main|Buffalo, New York parks system}}
[[File:Buffalo Botanical Gardens.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Buffalo and Erie County Botanical Gardens]]]]

The Buffalo parks system contains over 20 parks with multiple parks accessible from any part of the city. The Olmsted Park and Parkway System is the hallmark of Buffalo's many green spaces. Three-fourths of city park land is part of the system, which comprises six major parks, eight connecting parkways, nine circles and seven smaller spaces. Constructed in 1868 by [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] and his partner [[Calvert Vaux]], the system was integrated into the city and marks the first attempt in America to lay out a coordinated system of public parks and parkways. The Olmsted designed portions of the Buffalo park system are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and are maintained by the Buffalo Olmsted Parks Conservancy.
[[File:Buffharbor view.jpg|thumb|250px|left|View of Buffalo's harbor]]
Situated at the confluence of [[Lake Erie]] and the [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo River]] and [[Niagara River]]s, Buffalo is a waterfront city. The city's rise to economic power came through its waterways in the form of [[transshipment]], manufacturing, and an endless source of energy. Buffalo's waterfront remains, though to a lesser degree, a hub of commerce, trade, and industry.
[[File:Erie Canal Harbor redevelopment project.jpg|thumb|221x221px|Canalside at Erie Canal Harbor]]
As of 2009, a significant portion of Buffalo's waterfront is being transformed into a focal point for social and recreational activity. Buffalo's intent is to stress its architectural and historical heritage, creating a tourism destination.

An ongoing project within downtown Buffalo is the development of &quot;Canalside,&quot; intended to revitalize the original [[Erie Canal Harbor]] with shops, eateries, and tourist attractions. An early phase of the project was the excavation and filling of Erie Canal [[Commercial Slip]], which is the original western terminus of the Erie Canal System. Currently, work is underway to restore the canal system which was displaced by the construction of the [[Buffalo Memorial Auditorium]].

{{Main|Politics and Government of Buffalo, New York}}
{{See also|List of mayors of Buffalo, New York}}[[File:Buffalo federal court.jpg|thumb|right|[[Robert H. Jackson United States Courthouse]]]]
At the [[City (New York)|municipal]] level, the City of Buffalo has a mayor and a council consisting of nine [[city council|councilmembers]]. Buffalo also serves as the seat of [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] with some of the 11 members of county legislature representing at least a portion of Buffalo. At the state level, there are three state [[New York State Assembly|assemblymembers]] and two state [[New York State Senate|senators]] representing parts of the city proper. At the federal level, Buffalo is represented by three members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].

In a trend common to Northern &quot;[[Rust Belt]]&quot; regions, political life in Buffalo has been dominated by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] for the last half-century, and has been roiled by racial division and social issues. The last time anyone other than a Democrat held the position of Mayor in Buffalo was 1965 [[Chester A. Kowal]]. In 1977, Democratic Mayor [[James D. Griffin]] was first elected as the nominee of two minor parties, the [[Conservative Party (New York)|Conservative Party]] and the [[Right to Life Party]], after he lost the Democratic primary for Mayor to then Deputy State Assembly Speaker [[Arthur Eve]]. Griffin switched political allegiance several times during his 16 years as Mayor, generally hewing to socially conservative platforms. His successor, Democrat [[Anthony M. Masiello]] (elected in 1993) continued to campaign on [[social conservatism]], often crossing party lines in his endorsements and alliances. In 2005, however, Democrat [[Byron Brown]] was elected the city's first African-American mayor in a landslide (64%–27%) over [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Kevin Helfer, who ran on a conservative platform. In 2013, Brown would be endorsed by the Conservative Party because of his pledge to cut taxes.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

This change in local politics was preceded by a fiscal crisis in 2003 when years of economic decline, a diminishing tax-base, and civic mismanagement left the city deep in debt and teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. At the urging of [[New York State Comptroller]] [[Alan Hevesi]], the state took over the management of Buffalo's finances, appointing the Buffalo Fiscal Stability Authority. Conversations about merging the city with the larger Erie County government were initiated the following year by Mayor Tony Masiello, but came to naught.

The offices of the Buffalo District, [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] are located adjacent to the Black Rock Lock in the Black Rock channel of the [[Erie Canal]]. In addition to maintaining and operating the lock, the District is responsible for planning, design, construction and maintenance of water resources projects in an area extending from [[Toledo, Ohio]] to [[Massena (town), New York|Massena, New York]]. These include the [[Mount Morris Dam|flood-control dam]] at [[Mount Morris (town), New York|Mount Morris, New York]], oversight of the lower [[Great Lakes]] ([[Lake Erie|Erie]] and [[Lake Ontario|Ontario]]), review and permitting of wetlands construction, and remedial action for hazardous waste sites.

Buffalo is also the home of a major office of the [[National Weather Service]] (NOAA), which serves all of western and much of central New York State.

Buffalo is home to one of the 56 national [[List of FBI field offices|FBI field offices]]. The field office covers all of Western New York and parts of the Southern Tier and Central New York. The field office operates several task forces in conjunction with local agencies to help combat issues such as gang violence, terrorism threats and health care fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buffalo.fbi.gov/ |title=FBI Buffalo Division |publisher=Buffalo.fbi.gov |date=March 29, 2011 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110310043306/http://buffalo.fbi.gov/ |archivedate=March 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buffalo is also the location of the chief judge, [[United States Attorney]], and administrative offices for the [[United States District Court for the Western District of New York]].

Buffalo has increasingly become a center for [[bioinformatics]] and [[human genome]] research, including work by researchers at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]] and the [[Roswell Park Cancer Institute]], through a consortium known as the [[Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus]].

=== Transportation ===

==== Airports ====
[[File:Deford airport small.jpg|thumb|right|Buffalo Niagara International Airport]]
The [[Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority]] (NFTA) operates [[Buffalo Niagara International Airport]] and [[Niagara Falls International Airport]], however Buffalo is primarilyserved by the Buffalo Niagara International Airport, located in the nearby suburb of [[Cheektowaga]]. The airport, reconstructed in 1997, serves over 5&amp;nbsp;million passengers per year and growing{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}. Buffalo Niagara International Airport ranks among the five cheapest airports from which to fly in the country, according to the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics{{Citation needed|date = September 2014}}. The average round trip flight cost is $295.58.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffaloniagara.org/files/content/Industry/Back_Office.pdf|title=Buffalo Niagara Region Shared Services Opportunities|publisher=Buffaloniagra.org|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6IZClRJZF|archivedate=August 2, 2013}}, Retrieved 2013-5-31.&lt;/ref&gt; In the last few years there has been a surge in Canadians flying out of Buffalo, mainly due to much cheaper tax and airline surcharges, as compared with Canadian airports and the ability to fly on some US based discount carriers not available in Canada (for example, [[JetBlue Airways]] and [[Southwest Airlines]]). As of 2006, plans are in the works by U.S. Senator [[Charles Schumer]] to make the under-used Niagara Falls International Airport into an international cargo hub for New York and [[Toronto]], as well as Canada as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Niagara airport pushed as trade hub; Schumer joins effort to bring global cargo|author=Bill Michelmore|work=Buffalo News|page=B1|date=June 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Public transit ====
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
The [[Buffalo Metro Rail]], also operated by the NFTA, is a {{convert|6.4|mi|km}} long, single line [[light rail]] system that extends from [[Erie Canal Harbor]] in downtown Buffalo to the [[University Heights, Buffalo, New York|University Heights]] district (specifically, the South Campus of [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]]) in the northeastern part of the city. The downtown section of the line runs above ground and is free of charge to passengers. North of Theater Station, at the northern end of downtown, the line moves underground, remaining underground until it reaches the northern terminus of the line at University Heights. Passengers pay a fare to ride this section of the rail.
[[File:Main Court Building, Buffalo.JPG|thumb|A [[Buffalo Metro Rail]] station in downtown]]

A NFTA project underway, &quot;Cars Sharing Main Street&quot; will substantially revise the downtown portion of the Metro Rail. It will allow vehicular traffic and Metro Rail cars to share Main St. in a manner similar to that of the trolleys of [[Muni Metro|San Francisco]]. The design includes new stations and pedestrian-friendly improvements. The first phase of the project, restoring two way traffic on Main Street between Edward and West Tupper, was completed in 2009.

The NFTA operates bus lines throughout the city, region and suburbs.

==== Railroads ====
Two train stations, [[Buffalo-Depew (Amtrak station)|Buffalo-Depew]] and [[Buffalo-Exchange Street Station|Buffalo-Exchange Street]] serve the city and are operated by [[Amtrak]]. Historically the city was a major stop on through routes between Chicago and New York City through the lower Ontario peninsula.&lt;ref name=&quot;drury&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Drury | first = George H. | authorlink =  | title = The Historical Guide to North American Railroads: Histories, Figures, and Features of more than 160 Railroads Abandoned or Merged since 1930 | publisher = Kalmbach Publishing | year = 1994 | location = [[Waukesha, Wisconsin]] | pages = 91, 229–231| doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-89024-072-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] ran trains between Buffalo and Washington, D.C. on the [[Buffalo Line]] through central [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;1957 Pennsylvania Railroad schedules reprinted at http://www.therailwire.net/forum/index.php?topic=17913.15 {{Wayback|url=http://www.therailwire.net/forum/index.php?topic=17913.15|date =20140313045007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, New York Central trains went through the [[Buffalo Central Terminal]], [[Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad|Lackawanna]] trains went through its terminal on Main Street until the mid-1950s and the [[Lehigh Valley Railroad]]'s trains went through its terminal until 1952. From 1935 the [[Erie Railroad]] used the Lehigh Valley facility.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Central Terminal of Buffalo, New York History, 1842–1945 http://www.buffalohistoryworks.com/terminal/history/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buffalo Central Terminal, Decline, 1945–1960 http://www.buffalohistoryworks.com/terminal/death/death.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Freight service for Buffalo is served by [[CSX Transportation]] and [[Norfolk Southern]] (NS), as well as [[Canadian National]] (CN) and [[Canadian Pacific]] (CP) railroads from across the Border. The area has 4 large rail yards: Frontier (CSX), Bison (NS), SK (NS / CP) and Buffalo Creek (NS / CSX). A large amount of hazardous cargo also crosses through the Buffalo area, such as liquid [[propane]] and [[anhydrous ammonia]].

==== Waterways ====
[[File:Buffalo New York aerial view.jpg|thumb|The Buffalo Outer Harbor in 1992. Northeast of the city is the [[Niagara River]].]]
Buffalo is at the eastern end of one of the Great Lakes, Lake Erie, which boasts the greatest variety of freshwater sportfish in the country. The Lake serves as a playground for numerous personal yachts, sailboats, power boats and watercraft. The city has an extensive [[breakwall]] system protecting its inner and outer Lake Erie harbors, which are maintained at commercial navigation depths for [[Great Lakes]] freighters.

A Lake Erie tributary that flows through south Buffalo is the [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo River]] and Buffalo Creek. Buffalo is historically linked to the fabled [[Erie Canal]], which ends where the Black Rock Channel enters Lake Erie. When the Erie Canal was dedicated in 1825, its conceiver, New York State governor [[DeWitt Clinton]] planned to take waters from Lake Erie at Buffalo's western terminus of the canal (now the [[Commercial Slip]]), and pour it into the Atlantic Ocean in New York City. He sailed to New York on the [[Packet boat|canal packet]] ''Seneca Chief.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_boat|title = Erie Canal Time Machine|date = |accessdate = September 19, 2014|website = New York State Archives|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The seawater was poured into the Lake by Judge and future Buffalo Mayor [[Samuel Wilkeson]]. Once a major route for passengers and cargo, the Erie Canal played a primary role in opening up the American West to settlers from the east. The canal is now used primarily for pleasure craft and some light local freight, and in Buffalo it bypasses the swift upper reach of the [[Niagara River]]. A tributary of the Niagara River is [[Scajaquada Creek]], which flows though Buffalo, via the Olmsted-designed Delaware Lake and Park.

==== Streets and highways ====
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
Eight [[New York State Routes|New York State highways]], one three-digit [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highway]] and one [[U.S. Highway]] traverse the city of Buffalo. [[New York State Route 5]], commonly referred to as Main Street within the city{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}, enters through [[Lackawanna, New York|Lackawanna]] as a [[limited-access highway]] and intersects with [[Interstate 190 (New York)|Interstate 190]], a north-south highway connecting [[Interstate 90 in New York|Interstate 90]] in the southeastern suburb of [[Cheektowaga (town), New York|Cheektowaga]] with Niagara Falls. [[NY 354]] (Clinton Street) and [[NY 130]] (Broadway Avenue) are east to west highways connecting south and downtown Buffalo to the eastern suburbs of [[West Seneca, New York|West Seneca]] and [[Depew, New York|Depew]]. [[NY 265]] (Delaware Avenue) and [[NY 266]] (Niagara Street and Military Road) both originate in downtown Buffalo and terminate in the city of [[Tonawanda (city), New York|Tonawanda]].

One of three U.S. highways in Erie County, the others being [[U.S. 20]] and [[US Route 219|U.S. 219]], [[U.S. 62]] (Bailey Avenue) is a north to south trunk road that enters the city through Lackawanna and exits at the [[Amherst, NY|Amherst]] town border at a junction with NY 5. Within the city, the route passes by light industrial developments and high density areas of the city. Bailey Avenue has major intersections with Interstate 190 and the Kensington Expressway.

Three major expressways serve the city of Buffalo. The Scajaquada Expressway ([[NY 198]]) is primarily a limited access highway connecting Interstate 190 near [[Squaw Island (Buffalo)|Squaw Island]] to [[New York State Route 33]]. The Kensington Expressway (NY 33) begins at the edge of downtown and the city's [[East Side, Buffalo, New York|East Side]], continues through heavily populated areas of the city, intersects with Interstate 90 in Cheektowaga and ends shortly at the airport.

The [[Peace Bridge]] is a major international crossing located near the [[Black Rock, Buffalo, New York|Black Rock]] district of the city. The bridge connects [[Fort Erie, Ontario]] with the city.

=== Utilities ===
Buffalo’s water system was begun in 1827 with the founding of the Buffalo &amp; Black Rock Jubilee Water Works. This was followed in 1852 by the founding of the Buffalo Water Works Co. In 1868, the City of Buffalo bought both companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buffalohistory.com/water-works-intake-buffalo-n-y.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of the first [[water crib]] built by the city are still visible in the NIagara River just downstream of the Peace Bridge. This was replaced by a new water intake in 1907. The current water intake is in Emerald Channel, approximately halfway between the [[Buffalo Main Light]] and the ruins of the pier at Erie Beach in Fort Erie. From the water intake, the water goes to the Colonel Ward Pumping Station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lighthousefriends.com/light.asp?ID=299]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Buffalo’s water system is operated by [[Veolia Water]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buffalowater.org/Treatment]&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to reduce large-scale ice blockage blockage in the Niagara River, with resultant flooding, ice damage to docks and other waterfront structures, and blockage of the water intakes for the hydro-electric power plants at Niagara Falls, the [[New York Power Authority]] and [[Ontario Power Generation]] have jointly operated the Lake Erie-Niagara River Ice Boom since 1964. The boom is installed on December 16, or when the water temperature reaches 4˚ Celsius (C) (39˚ Fahrenheit (F)), whichever happens first. The boom is opened on April 1 unless there is more than 650 square kilometres (250 square miles) of ice remaining in Eastern Lake Erie. When in place, the boom stretches 2,680 metres (8,800 feet) from the outer breakwall at Buffalo Harbor almost to the Canadian shore near the ruins of the pier at Erie Beach in Fort Erie. Originally, the boom was made of wooden timbers, but these have been replaced by steel pontoons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijc.org/rel/boards/niagara/ice_glace-info_e.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
