==History==

===Formation and early years (1996–1998)===
Belle and Sebastian were formed in Glasgow, Scotland in 1996 by [[Stuart Murdoch (musician)|Stuart Murdoch]] and [[Stuart David]].&lt;ref name=&quot;a2x&quot;/&gt; Together, with [[Stow College]] music professor [[Alan Rankine]], they recorded some demos; these demos were picked up by the college's Music Business course that produces and releases one single each year on the college's label, [[Electric Honey (label)|Electric Honey]]. As the band had a number of songs already and the label was extremely impressed with the demos, Belle and Sebastian were allowed to record a full-length album, which was titled ''[[Tigermilk]]''. Murdoch once described the band as a &quot;product of botched capitalism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;a2x&quot;/&gt;

''Tigermilk'' was recorded in three days and originally only one thousand copies were pressed on [[Gramophone record|vinyl]].&lt;ref name=&quot;grd&quot;/&gt; These original copies now sell for up to £400.&lt;ref name=&quot;rse&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Pareles |first=John |title=The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll |publisher=[[Fireside Publishing]] |year=2001 |page=66 |isbn=0-7432-0120-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Shiel |first=George |title=Tigermilk |url=http://www.eclectichoney.com/tigermilk.html |work=Eclectic Honey |accessdate=4 November 2007 |format=&lt;sup&gt;[http://scholar.google.co.uk/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=author%3AShiel+intitle%3ATigermilk&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;btnG=Search Scholar search]&lt;/sup&gt; |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070616110535/http://www.eclectichoney.com/tigermilk.html |archivedate = 16 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs&quot;&gt;{{Citation |title=Belle and Sebastian 2nd Melbourne show! |url=http://www.pbsfm.org.au/Documents.asp?ID=2536&amp;Title=Belle+and+Sebastian+2nd+Melbourne+show!++ |work=PBS 106.7FM |accessdate=4 November 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070916203738/http://pbsfm.org.au/Documents.asp?ID=2536&amp;Title=Belle+and+Sebastian+2nd+Melbourne+show!++ |archivedate = 16 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The warm reception the album received inspired Murdoch and David to turn the band into a full-time project, recruiting [[Stevie Jackson]] (guitar and vocals), [[Isobel Campbell]] (cello/vocals), [[Chris Geddes]] (keys) and [[Richard Colburn]] (drums) to fill out the group.

After the success of the debut album, Belle and Sebastian were signed to [[Jeepster Records]] in August 1996 and ''[[If You're Feeling Sinister]]'', their second album, was released on 18 November.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs&quot;/&gt; The album was named by ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' as one of the 100 greatest albums between 1985 and 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005 |url=http://www.spin.com/articles/100-greatest-albums-1985-2005 |work=Spin |date=20 June 2005 |accessdate=11 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is widely considered the band's masterpiece.&lt;ref name=&quot;notebook&quot;/&gt; Just before the recording of ''Sinister'', [[Sarah Martin (musician)|Sarah Martin]] (violin/vocals) joined the band. Following this a series of EPs were released in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hornby |first=Nick |title=Lazy Line Painter Jane |url=http://www.salon.com/music/sharps/1997/11/14sharps.html |work=Salon |date=14 November 1997 |accessdate=5 November 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071210214633/http://www.salon.com/music/sharps/1997/11/14sharps.html| archivedate= 10 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these was ''[[Dog on Wheels]]'', which contained four demo tracks recorded before the real formation of the band. In fact, the only long-term band members to play on the songs were Murdoch, David, and [[Mick Cooke]], who played trumpet on the EP but would not officially join the band until a few years later. It charted at No.&amp;nbsp;59 in the UK singles chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs&quot;/&gt;

The ''[[Lazy Line Painter Jane]]'' EP followed in July. The track was recorded in the church where Murdoch lived&lt;ref name=&quot;lim&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Lim |first=Dennis |title=Winter of Their Youth |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/1998-09-15/music/winter-of-their-youth/ |work=The Village Voice |date=15 September 1998 |accessdate=5 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and features vocals from [[Monica Queen]]. The EP narrowly missed out of the UK top 40, peaking at No.&amp;nbsp;41.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs&quot;/&gt; The last of the 1997 EPs was October's ''[[3.. 6.. 9 Seconds of Light]]''. The EP was made Single of the Week in both the ''[[NME]]'' and ''[[Melody Maker]]'' and reached No.&amp;nbsp;32 in the charts, thus becoming the band's first top 40 single.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs&quot;/&gt;

In 1999 the band was awarded with Best Newcomer (for their third album) at the [[BRIT Awards]], upsetting better-known acts such as [[Steps (band)|Steps]] and [[5ive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Robbie rules over Brits |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/special_report/1999/02/99/brit_awards/280847.stm |publisher=BBC |date=17 February 1999 |accessdate=4 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, the band hosted their own festival, the [[Bowlie Weekender]]. ''[[Tigermilk]]'' was also given a full release by [[Jeepster Records|Jeepster]] before the band started work on their next LP. The result was ''[[Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant]]'', which became the band's first top 10 album in the UK.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs&quot;/&gt; A stand-alone single, &quot;[[Legal Man]]&quot;, reached No.&amp;nbsp;15 and gave them their first appearance on [[Top of the Pops]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Urban |first=Andy |title=Side Project Becomes Full-Length Let Down |url=http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/237 |work=Dusted Magazine |date=18 June 2002 |accessdate=4 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the band's popularity and recognition was growing worldwide, their music began appearing in films and on television.

===Line-up and label changes (2000&amp;ndash;2005)===
[[Stuart David]] soon left the band to concentrate on his side project, [[Looper (band)|Looper]], and his book writing, which included his ''The Idle Thoughts of a Daydreamer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Heim |first=Joe |title=Sharps &amp; Flats: Looper |url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/music/review/2000/05/09/looper/index.html |work=Salon |date=9 May 2000 |accessdate=5 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by [[Bobby Kildea]] of [[V-Twin (band)|V-Twin]]. The &quot;[[Jonathan David]]&quot; single, sung by Stevie Jackson, was released in June 2001 and was followed by &quot;[[I'm Waking Up to Us]]&quot; in November. &quot;I'm Waking Up to Us&quot; saw the band use an outside producer ([[Mike Hurst (producer)|Mike Hurst]]) for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;pop&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Sturges |first=Fiona |title=Pop: Scots of the arch antics |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20011130/ai_n14433572 |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=30 November 2001 |accessdate=5 November 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071210184343/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20011130/ai_n14433572 |archivedate = 10 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of 2002 was spent touring and recording a soundtrack album, ''[[Storytelling (Belle and Sebastian album)|Storytelling]]'' (for ''[[Storytelling (film)|Storytelling]]'' by [[Todd Solondz]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Nichols |first=Peter M. |title=The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |year=2004 |page=955 |isbn=0-312-32611-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell left the band in the spring of 2002, in the middle of the band's North American tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hansen |first=Liane |title=Isobel Campbell: After Belle Comes 'Ballad' |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5288601 |work=National Public Radio |date=19 March 2006 |accessdate=4 November 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071213050305/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5288601| archivedate= 13 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mtv&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |title=Belle and Sebastian: Full Biography |url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/belle_sebastian_1/artist.jhtml#bio |publisher=MTV |accessdate=4 November 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071012020424/http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/belle_sebastian_1/artist.jhtml| archivedate= 12 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to success (2005&amp;ndash;2010)===
In April 2005, members of the band visited [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian territories]] with the UK charity [[War on Want]];&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot;/&gt; the group subsequently recorded a song inspired by the trip titled &quot;The Eighth Station of the Cross Kebab House&quot;, which would first appear on the digital-download version of the charity album [[Help!: A Day in the Life]] and would later have a physical release as a B-side on 2006's &quot;[[Funny Little Frog]]&quot; single. ''[[Push Barman to Open Old Wounds]]'', a compilation of the Jeepster singles and EPs, was released in May 2005 while the band were recording their seventh album in California. The result of the sessions was ''[[The Life Pursuit]]'', produced by [[Tony Hoffer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Petridis |first=Alexis |title=Belle and Sebastian, The Life Pursuit |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2006/feb/03/popandrock.shopping9 |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=3 February 2006 |accessdate=5 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Beaujon |first=Andrew |title=The Happiness Of 'Pursuit' |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/07/AR2006020701798.html |work=Washington Post |date=8 February 2006 |accessdate=5 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album, originally intended to be a double album,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=McBay |first=Nadine |title=Belle &amp; Sebastian: We managed to do things without pandering to the London machine |url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/580171-belle-sebastian--we-managed-to-do-things-without-pandering-to-the-london-machine |work=Drowned In Sound |date=19 January 2006 |accessdate=4 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; became the band's highest-charting album upon its release in February 2006, peaking at No.&amp;nbsp;8 in the UK and No.&amp;nbsp;65 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Harris |first=Chris |title=Jack Johnson Scores First Billboard No.&amp;nbsp;1 With 'Curious' Tunes |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1524351/20060215/johnson_jack.jhtml |publisher=MTV |date=15 February 2006 |accessdate=5 November 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071213055146/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1524351/20060215/johnson_jack.jhtml| archivedate= 13 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Belle &amp; Sebastian get the 'Blues' on new single |url=http://www.nme.com/news/belle-and-sebastian/22384 |work=NME |location=UK |date=3 March 2006 |accessdate=5 November 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071130035714/http://www.nme.com/news/belle-and-sebastian/22384| archivedate= 30 November 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Funny Little Frog&quot;, which preceded it, also proved to be their highest-charting single, debuting at No.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;ref name=&quot;notebook&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Sanneh |first=Kelefa |title=CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; A Quiet Band Worth Fighting Loudly About Makes Some More Noise |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CEFDB1F3FF931A35751C0A9609C8B63 |work=New York Times |date=2 February 2006 |accessdate=5 November 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071211024132/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CEFDB1F3FF931A35751C0A9609C8B63| archivedate= 11 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Pitchforkmedia|Pitchfork TV]] released an hour-long documentary in February, directed by RJ Bentler which focused on the band's 1996 album [[If You're Feeling Sinister]], as well as the formation and early releases of the band.
