[[Moloch|Milcom]] and [[Moloch|Molech]] (who may be one and the same) are named in the Bible as the gods of Ammon.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:05-33|NIV}}; {{bibleverse|2|Kings|23:13|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Bible==

According to the biblical account, Ammon and [[Moab]] were born to [[Lot (biblical)|Lot]] and Lot's younger and elder daughters, respectively, in the aftermath of the destruction of [[Sodom and Gomorrah]]. The Bible refers to both the Ammonites and Moabites as Lot's sons {{bibleverse||Genesis|19:37-38|NIV}}.  The Hebrew tradition makes this tribe related to the Israelites. This is reflected in the name usually employed in the Old Testament to designate them, Ben `Ammi, Bene `Ammon, &quot;son of my people,&quot; &quot;children of my people,&quot; i.e. relatives. Hence we find that the Israelites are commanded to avoid conflict with them on their march to the Promised Land ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_deuteronomy02_sml.htm#deuteronomy_2:19 Deuteronomy 2:19]). Their dwelling-place was on the east of the Dead Sea and the Jordan, between the Arnon and the Jabbok, but, before the advance of the Hebrews, they had been dispossessed of a portion of their land by the Amorites, who founded, along the east side of the Jordan and the Dead Sea, the kingdom of Sihon ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_numbers21_sml.htm#numbers_21:21 Numbers 21:21] - [http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_numbers21_sml.htm#numbers_21:31 31]).&lt;ref name=&quot;bibler.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bibler.org/glossary/ammon.html |title=www.Bibler.org - Dictionary - Ammon |date=2012-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Bible, the Ammonites and Israelites are portrayed as mutual antagonists. During [[the Exodus]], the Israelites were prohibited by the Ammonites from passing through their lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Deuteronomy|23:4|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Book of Judges]], the Ammonites work with [[Eglon (king)|Eglon]], king of the Moabites against Israel. Attacks by the Ammonites on Israelite communities east of the Jordan were the impetus behind the unification of the tribes under [[Saul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|11:1-15|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; They seem to have been completely subdued by David and their capital was taken, and we find a better spirit manifested afterward, for Nahash of Rabbah showed kindness to him when a fugitive ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_2samuel17_sml.htm#2samuel_17:27 2 Samuel 17:27] - [http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_2samuel17_sml.htm#2samuel_17:29 29]). David was also aided by Zelek the Ammonite of his [[David's Mighty Warriors|mighty warriors]] in the conquering of the [[City of David]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|11:39|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their country came into the possession of Jeroboam, on the division of the kingdom, and when the Syrians of Damascus deprived the kingdom of Israel of their possessions east of the Jordan, the Ammonites became subjects of Benhadad, and we find a contingent of 1,000 of them serving as allies of that king in the great battle of the Syrians with the Assyrians at Qarqar (854 BC) in the reign of Shalmaneser III. They may have regained their old territory when Tiglath-pileser carried off the Israelites East of the Jordan into captivity ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_2kings15_sml.htm#2kings_15:29 2 Kings 15:29] ; [http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_1chronicles05_sml.htm#1chronicles_5:26 1 Chronicles 5:26]). Their hostility to both kingdoms, Judah and Israel, was often manifested. In the days of Jehoshaphat they joined with the Moabites in an attack upon him, but met with disaster ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_2chronicles20_sml.htm 2 Chronicles 20]). They paid tribute to Jotham ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_2chronicles27_sml.htm#2chronicles_27:5 2 Chronicles 27:5]). After submitting to Tiglath-pileser they were generally tributary to Assyria, but we have mention of their joining in the general uprising that took place under Sennacherib; but they submitted and we find them tributary in the reign of Esarhaddon. Their hostility to Judah is shown in their joining the Chaldeans to destroy it ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_2kings24_sml.htm#2kings_24:2 2 Kings 24:2]). Their cruelty is denounced by the prophet Amos
([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_amos01_sml.htm#amos_1:13 Amos 1:13]), and their destruction (with their return in the future) by Jeremiah ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_jeremiah49_sml.htm#jeremiah_49:1 Jeremiah 49:1] - [http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_jeremiah49_sml.htm#jeremiah_49:6 6]) ; Ezekiel ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_ezekiel21_sml.htm#ezekiel_21:28 Ezekiel 21:28] - [http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_ezekiel21_sml.htm#ezekiel_21:32 32]) ; and Zechariah ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_zechariah02_sml.htm#zechariah_2:8 Zechariah 2:8], [http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_zechariah02_sml.htm#zechariah_2:9 9]). Their murder of Gedaliah ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_2kings25_sml.htm#2kings_25:22 2 Kings 25:22] - [http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_2kings25_sml.htm#2kings_25:26 26] ; [http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_jeremiah40_sml.htm#jeremiah_40:14 Jeremiah 40:14]) was a dastardly act.

Tobiah the Ammonite united with Sanballat to oppose Nehemiah ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_nehemiah04_sml.htm Nehemiah 4]), and their opposition to the Jews did not cease with the establishment of the latter in Judea.

They also joined the Syrians in their wars with the Maccabees and were defeated by Judas.&lt;ref name=&quot;bibler.org&quot;/&gt;

According to both {{bibleverse|1|Kings|14:21-31|NIV}} and {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|12:13|NIV}}, [[Naamah (wife of Solomon)|Naamah]] was an Ammonite. She was the only wife of King [[Solomon]] to be mentioned by name in the [[Tanakh]] as having borne a child. She was the mother of Solomon's successor, [[Rehoboam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = |first = |title = The Jewish Encyclopedia|url = http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1&amp;letter=N|accessdate = 2007-08-05| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070813035717/http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1&amp;letter=N| archivedate= 13 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ammonites presented a serious problem to the [[Pharisees]] because many marriages with Ammonite (and Moabite) wives had taken place in the days of [[Nehemiah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Nehemiah|13:23|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The men had married women of the various nations without conversion, which made the children not Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;The identity of those particular tribes had been lost during the ''mixing of the nations'' caused by the conquests of [[Assyria]]. As a result, people from those nations were treated as complete gentiles and could convert without restriction.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legitimacy of [[David]]'s claim to royalty was disputed on account of his descent from Ruth, the Moabite.&lt;ref&gt;The Babylonian [[Talmud]] points out that [[Doeg the Edomite]] was the source of this dispute. He claimed that since David was descended from someone who was not allowed to marry into the community, his male ancestors were no longer part of the [[tribe of Judah]] (which was the tribe the King had to belong to).  As a result, he could neither be the king, nor could he marry any Jewish woman (since he descended from a [[Moab]]ite convert). The Prophet [[Samuel]] wrote the Book of Ruth in order to remind the people of the original law that women from [[Moab]] and Ammon were allowed to convert and marry into the Jewish people immediately.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to Assyria==
Ammon maintained its independence from the [[Assyria]]n empire through tribute to the Assyrian king, at a time when nearby kingdoms were being raided or conquered.&lt;ref name = Jordan/&gt; [[Kurkh Monolith|Inscriptions describe]] the Ammonite king [[Baasha ben Ruhubi]]'s army fighting alongside [[Ahab]] of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Syria]]n allies against [[Shalmaneser III]] at the [[Battle of Qarqar]] in 853 BC, possibly as vassals of [[Hadadezer]], the Aramaean king of [[Aram Damascus|Damascus]]. In 734 BC the Ammonite king [[Sanipu]] was a vassal of [[Tiglath-Pileser III]], and Sanipu's successor [[Pudu-ilu]] held the same position under [[Sennacherib]] and [[Esarhaddon]]. An Assyrian tribute-list exists from this period, showing that Ammon paid one-fifth of Judah's tribute.&lt;ref&gt;See Schrader, ''K.A.T.'' pp. 141 et seq.; Delitzsch, ''Paradies,'' p. 294; Winckler, ''Geschichte Israels,'' p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

Somewhat later, the Ammonite king [[Amminadab (Ammon)|Amminadab I]] was among the tributaries who suffered in the course of the great [[Arabia]]n campaign of [[Assurbanipal]]. Other kings attested to in contemporary sources are [[Barakel]] (attested to in several contemporary [[seal (device)|seals]]) and [[Hissalel]], the latter of whom reigned about 620 BCE. Hissalel is mentioned in an inscription on a bottle found at [[Tel Siran]], Jordan along with his son, King Amminadab II, who reigned around 600 BCE.

==In the Persian, Hellenistic, and Roman eras==
Little mention is made of the Ammonites through the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] and early [[Hellenistic Age|Hellenistic]] periods{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}.

Their name appears, however, during the time of the [[Maccabees]]. The Ammonites, with some of the neighboring tribes, did their utmost to resist and check the revival of the Jewish power under [[Judas Maccabaeus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[1 Maccabees]] 5:6; cf. [[Josephus]] ''[[Jewish Antiquities]]'' xii. 8. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last notice of the Ammonites is in [[Justin Martyr]] (second century) ''Dialogue with Trypho'' (§ 119), where it is affirmed that they were still a numerous people, concentrated in the south of [[Palestine]].{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Language==
{{Main|Ammonite language}}
The few Ammonite names that have been preserved also include Nahash and [[Hanun (disambiguation)|Hanun]], both from the Bible. The Ammonites' language is believed to be [[Semitic]], closely related to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Moabite language|Moabite]]. Ammonite may have incorporated certain [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] influences, including the use of ''‘bd'', instead of commoner Biblical Hebrew ''‘śh'', for &quot;work&quot;. The only other notable difference with Biblical Hebrew is the sporadic retention of feminine singular ''-t'' (e.g. ''’šħt'' &quot;cistern&quot;, but ''‘lyh'' &quot;high (fem.)&quot;.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Cohen|first = D (ed)|year = 1988|title = Les langues dans le monde ancien et modern, part 3|chapter = Les Langues Chamito-semitiques|publisher = [[French National Centre for Scientific Research|CNRS]]|location = Paris}}{{cite book|last = Aufrecht|first = WE|title = A Corpus of Ammonite Inscriptions|isbn = 0-88946-089-2|location =  Lewiston|publisher = E. Mellen Press|year = 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Like its sister-kingdom of Moab, Ammon was the source of numerous natural resources, including [[sandstone]] and [[limestone]]. It had a productive agricultural sector and occupied a vital place along the [[King's Highway (ancient)|King's Highway]], the ancient trade route connecting [[Egypt]] with [[Mesopotamia]], [[Syria]], and [[Asia Minor]]. As with the Edomites and Moabites, trade along this route gave them considerable revenue. Circa 950 BCE Ammon showed rising prosperity, due to [[agriculture]] and [[trade]], and built a series of fortresses. Its capital was located in what is now the Citadel of [[Amman]].&lt;ref name = Jordan&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_testament.html|title = The Old Testament Kingdoms of Jordan|accessdate = 2009-05-12| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090506015442/http://www.kinghussein.gov.jo/his_testament.html| archivedate= 6 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
