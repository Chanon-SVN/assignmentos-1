Absolute Infinite
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Confusing|date=November 2007}}

The '''Absolute Infinite''' is [[mathematician]] [[Georg Cantor]]'s concept of an &quot;[[infinity]]&quot; that transcends the [[transfinite number]]s.  Cantor linked the Absolute Infinite with [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;§3.2, {{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He held that the Absolute Infinite had various [[mathematical]] properties, including the [[reflection principle]] which says that every property of the Absolute Infinite is also held by some smaller object.&lt;ref&gt;''Infinity: New Research and Frontiers'' by Michael Heller and W. Hugh Woodin (2011), [http://books.google.com/books?id=PVNbIGS37wMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 11].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cantor's view ==
Cantor is quoted as saying:

{{quote|The actual infinite arises in three contexts: first when it is realized in the most complete form, in a fully independent otherworldly being, ''in Deo'', where I call it the Absolute Infinite or simply Absolute; second when it occurs in the contingent, created world; third when the mind grasps it ''in abstracto'' as a mathematical magnitude, number or order type.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Mind Tools: The Five Levels of Mathematical Reality'', Rudy Rucker, Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1987; ISBN 0-395-38315-3.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cantor also mentioned the idea in his letters to [[Richard Dedekind]] (text in square brackets not present in original):{{#tag:ref|''Gesammelte Abhandlungen'',&lt;ref&gt;''Gesammelte Abhandlungen mathematischen und philosophischen Inhalts'', Georg Cantor, ed. Ernst Zermelo, with biography by Adolf Fraenkel; orig. pub.

However, as [[Ivor Grattan-Guinness]] has discovered,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digizeitschriften.de/home/services/pdfterms/?ID=516899 The Rediscovery of the Cantor-Dedekind Correspondence], I. Grattan-Guinness, ''Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereinigung'' '''76''' (1974/75), pp. 104–139, at p. 126 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; this is in fact an amalgamation by Cantor's editor, [[Ernst Zermelo]], of two letters from Cantor to Dedekind, the first dated July 28 and the second dated August 3.|name=GesammelteAbhandlungen}}

A [[cardinal number|multiplicity]] is called [[well-ordered]] if it fulfills the condition that every sub-multiplicity has a first [[element (mathematics)|element]]; such a multiplicity I call for short a &quot;sequence&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now I envisage the system of all [ordinal] numbers and denote it ''Ω''.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The system ''Ω'' in its natural ordering according to magnitude is a &quot;sequence&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
Now let us adjoin 0 as an additional element to this sequence, and place it, obviously, in the first position; then we obtain a sequence ''Ω′'':&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
0, 1, 2, 3, ... &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1, ..., &amp;gamma;, ...
&lt;br /&gt;
of which one can readily convince oneself that every number γ occurring in it is the type [i.e., order-type] of the sequence of all its preceding elements (including 0).  (The sequence ''Ω'' has this property first for ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1. [ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;+1 should be ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.])&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now ''Ω&amp;prime;'' (and therefore also ''Ω'') cannot be a consistent multiplicity. For if ''Ω&amp;prime;'' were consistent, then as a well-ordered set, a number ''δ'' would correspond to it which would be greater than all numbers of the system ''Ω''; the number ''δ'', however, also belongs to the system ''Ω'', because it comprises all numbers. Thus ''δ'' would be greater than ''δ'', which is a contradiction. Therefore:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
''The system Ω of all [ordinal] numbers is an inconsistent, absolutely infinite multiplicity.''}}

== The Burali-Forti paradox ==
{{main|Burali-Forti paradox}}
The idea that the collection of all ordinal numbers cannot logically exist seems [[paradoxical]] to many. This is related to [[Burali-Forti paradox|Cesare Burali-Forti's &quot;paradox&quot;]] which states that there can be no greatest [[ordinal number]]. All of these problems can be traced back to the idea that, for every property that can be logically defined, there exists a set of all objects that have that property. However, as in Cantor's argument (above), this idea leads to difficulties.

More generally, as noted by [[A.W. Moore (mathematician)|A.W. Moore]], there can be no end to the process of [[set (mathematics)|set]] formation, and thus no such thing as the ''totality of all sets'', or the ''set hierarchy''.  Any such totality would itself have to be a set, thus lying somewhere within the [[cumulative hierarchy|hierarchy]] and thus failing to contain every set.

A standard solution to this problem is found in [[Zermelo set theory|Zermelo's set theory]], which does not allow the unrestricted formation of sets from arbitrary properties. Rather, we may form the set of all objects that have a given property ''and lie in some given set'' (Zermelo's [[Axiom schema of specification|Axiom of Separation]]). This allows for the formation of sets based on properties, in a limited sense, while (hopefully) preserving the consistency of the theory.

While this solves the logical problem, one could argue that the philosophical problem remains. It seems natural that a set of individuals ought to exist, so long as the individuals exist. Indeed, [[naive set theory]] might be said to be based on this notion. Although Zermelo's fix allows a [[Class (set theory)|class]] to describe arbitrary (possibly &quot;large&quot;) entities, these predicates of the [[meta-language]] may have no formal existence (i.e., as a set) within the theory. For example, the class of all sets would be a [[proper class]]. This is philosophically unsatisfying to some and has motivated additional work in [[set theory]] and other methods of formalizing the foundations of mathematics such as [[New Foundations#How NF.28U.29 avoids the set-theoretic paradoxes|New Foundations]] by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]].
