***** EDITORS, PLEASE NOTE: *****

The question of nationality is a contentious one in that Alexander Graham Bell has been variously claimed as Scottish, British, American, and Canadian. Bell made a number of inventions as a formal British citizen after immigrating to Canada and then moving to the United States, notably the telephone in 1876; however he did not become an American citizen until 1882. Therefore if nationality is to be described specifically ... Alexander Graham Bell, British inventor of the telephone, died as an American citizen in Canada. The wording in the lead paragraph was carefully crafted after input from many editors to accommodate the many diverse claims. It is recognized that in the last years of his life, Bell had American citizenship, although he lived primarily in Canada on his estate. His life's work and details on his nationality and citizenship are provided in later sections. Please discuss any potentially divisive submissions prior to editing the introductory section.

Of course, he never had one in his study. That was where he went when he wanted to be alone with his thoughts and his work. The telephone, of course, means intrusion by the outside world.

But all really important business over the telephone he transacted himself. There are few private houses more completely equipped with telephones than ours... and there was nothing that Mr. Bell was more particular about than our telephone service...

== Early life ==

Alexander Bell was born in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, on March 3, 1847.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie 1975, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The family home was at 16 South Charlotte Street, and has a stone inscription marking it as Alexander Graham Bell's birthplace. He had two brothers: Melville James Bell (1845–70) and Edward Charles Bell (1848–67). Both of his brothers died of [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/bellhtml/belltime.html &quot;Time Line of Alexander Graham Bell.&quot;] ''memory.loc.goiv.'' Retrieved: July 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Professor [[Alexander Melville Bell]], and his mother was Eliza Grace (née Symonds).{{#tag:ref|&quot;Alexander M. Bell Dead. Father of Prof. A.G. Bell Developed [[Sign language|Sign Language]] for Mutes.&quot; ''[[New York Times]]'' Tuesday, August 8, 1905.|group=N}} Although he was born &quot;Alexander&quot;, at age 10, he made a plea to his father to have a middle name like his two brothers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fi.edu/case_files/bell/agb.html &quot;Call me Alexander Graham Bell.&quot;] ''fi.edu.'' Retrieved: July 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref| Bell typically signed his name in full on his correspondence.|group=N}} For his 11th birthday, his father acquiesced and allowed him to adopt the middle name &quot;Graham&quot;, chosen out of admiration for Alexander Graham, a Canadian being treated by his father and boarder who had become a family friend.&lt;ref&gt;Groundwater 2005, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; To close relatives and friends he remained &quot;Aleck&quot; which his father continued to call him into later life.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, pp. 17–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First invention===
As a child, young Alexander displayed a natural curiosity about his world, resulting in gathering botanical specimens as well as experimenting even at an early age. His best friend was Ben Herdman, a neighbor whose family operated a flour mill, the scene of many forays. Young Aleck asked what needed to be done at the mill. He was told wheat had to be dehusked through a laborious process and at the age of 12, Bell built a homemade device that combined rotating paddles with sets of nail brushes, creating a simple dehusking machine that was put into operation and used steadily for a number of years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce p. 16.&quot;&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In return, John Herdman gave both boys the run of a small workshop in which to &quot;invent&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce p. 16.&quot;/&gt;

From his early years, Bell showed a sensitive nature and a talent for art, poetry and music that was encouraged by his mother. With no formal training, he mastered the piano and became the family's pianist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray p. 8&quot;&gt;Gray 2006, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being normally quiet and introspective, he reveled in mimicry and &quot;voice tricks&quot; akin to [[ventriloquism]] that continually entertained family guests during their occasional visits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray p. 8&quot;/&gt; Bell was also deeply affected by his mother's gradual deafness, (she began to lose her hearing when he was 12) and learned a manual finger language so he could sit at her side and tap out silently the conversations swirling around the family parlour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray p. 9&quot;&gt;Gray 2006, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; He also developed a technique of speaking in clear, modulated tones directly into his mother's forehead wherein she would hear him with reasonable clarity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mackay p.25&quot;&gt;Mackay 1997, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell's preoccupation with his mother's deafness led him to study [[acoustics]].

His family was long associated with the teaching of elocution: his grandfather, Alexander Bell, in London, his uncle in [[Dublin]], and his father, in Edinburgh, were all elocutionists. His father published a variety of works on the subject, several of which are still well known, especially his ''The Standard Elocutionist'' (1860),&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray p. 8&quot;/&gt; which appeared in Edinburgh in 1868. ''The Standard Elocutionist'' appeared in 168 British editions and sold over a quarter of a million copies in the United States alone. In this treatise, his father explains his methods of how to instruct [[deaf-mute]]s (as they were then known) to articulate words and read other people's lip movements to decipher meaning. Aleck's father taught him and his brothers not only to write [[Visible Speech]] but to identify any symbol and its accompanying sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;Petrie p. 7&quot;&gt;Petrie 1975, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Aleck became so proficient that he became a part of his father's public demonstrations and astounded audiences with his abilities. He could decipher Visible Speech representing virtually every language, including [[Latin]], [[Scottish Gaelic]] and even [[Sanskrit]], accurately reciting written tracts without any prior knowledge of their pronunciation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Petrie p. 7&quot;/&gt;

===Education===
As a young child, Bell, like his brothers, received his early schooling at home from his father. At an early age, however, he was enrolled at the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|Royal High School]], Edinburgh, Scotland, which he left at age 15, completing only the first four forms.&lt;ref&gt;Mackay 1997, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; His school record was undistinguished, marked by absenteeism and lacklustre grades. His main interest remained in the sciences, especially biology, while he treated other school subjects with indifference, to the dismay of his demanding father.&lt;ref&gt;Gray 2006, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon leaving school, Bell travelled to London to live with his grandfather, Alexander Bell. During the year he spent with his grandfather, a love of learning was born, with long hours spent in serious discussion and study. The elder Bell took great efforts to have his young pupil learn to speak clearly and with conviction, the attributes that his pupil would need to become a teacher himself.&lt;ref&gt;Town 1988, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; At age 16, Bell secured a position as a &quot;pupil-teacher&quot; of [[elocution]] and music, in Weston House Academy, at [[Elgin, Moray]], Scotland. Although he was enrolled as a student in Latin and Greek, he instructed classes himself in return for board and £10 per session.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he attended the [[University of Edinburgh]]; joining his older brother Melville who had enrolled there the previous year. In 1868, not long before he departed for Canada with his family, Aleck completed his matriculation exams and was accepted for admission to the [[University of London]].&lt;ref&gt;Shulman 2008, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First experiments with sound===
Bell's father encouraged Aleck's interest in speech and, in 1863, took his sons to see a unique [[automaton]], developed by Sir [[Charles Wheatstone]] based on the earlier work of [[Wolfgang von Kempelen|Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Groundwater p. 25&quot;&gt;Groundwater 2005, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  The rudimentary &quot;mechanical man&quot; simulated a human voice. Aleck was fascinated by the machine and after he obtained a copy of von Kempelen's book, published in German, and had laboriously translated it, he and his older brother Melville built their own automaton head. Their father, highly interested in their project, offered to pay for any supplies and spurred the boys on with the enticement of a &quot;big prize&quot; if they were successful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Groundwater p. 25&quot;/&gt; While his brother constructed the throat and [[larynx]], Aleck tackled the more difficult task of recreating a realistic skull. His efforts resulted in a remarkably lifelike head that could &quot;speak&quot;, albeit only a few words.&lt;ref name=&quot;Groundwater p. 25&quot;/&gt; The boys would carefully adjust the &quot;lips&quot; and when a [[bellows]] forced air through the [[Vertebrate trachea|windpipe]], a very recognizable &quot;Mama&quot; ensued, to the delight of neighbors who came to see the Bell invention.&lt;ref name=&quot;Petrie pp. 7–9&quot;&gt;Petrie 1975, pp. 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intrigued by the results of the automaton, Bell continued to experiment with a live subject, the family's [[Skye Terrier]], &quot;Trouve&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie 1975, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; After he taught it to growl continuously, Aleck would reach into its mouth and manipulate the dog's lips and [[Vocal folds|vocal cords]] to produce a crude-sounding &quot;Ow ah oo ga ma ma&quot;. With little convincing, visitors believed his dog could articulate &quot;How are you grandma?&quot; More indicative of his playful nature, his experiments convinced onlookers that they saw a &quot;talking dog&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Groundwater p. 30.&quot; &quot;&gt;Groundwater 2005, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; However, these initial forays into experimentation with sound led Bell to undertake his first serious work on the transmission of sound, using [[tuning fork]]s to explore [[resonance]].

At the age of 19, he wrote a report on his work and sent it to philologist [[Alexander John Ellis|Alexander Ellis]], a colleague of his father (who would later be portrayed as Professor Henry Higgins in ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Groundwater p. 30.&quot; &quot;&gt;Groundwater 2005, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis immediately wrote back indicating that the experiments were similar to existing work in Germany, and also lent Aleck a copy of [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]'s work, ''The Sensations of Tone as a Physiological Basis for the Theory of Music''.&lt;ref&gt;Shulman 2008, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dismayed to find that groundbreaking work had already been undertaken by Helmholtz who had conveyed vowel sounds by means of a similar tuning fork &quot;contraption&quot;, he pored over the German scientist's book. Working from his own erroneous mistranslation of a French edition,&lt;ref name=&quot;DictionaryOfCanBiography&quot; /&gt; Aleck fortuitously then made a deduction that would be the underpinning of all his future work on transmitting sound, reporting: &quot;Without knowing much about the subject, it seemed to me that if vowel sounds could be produced by electrical means, so could consonants, so could articulate speech.&quot;  He also later remarked: &quot;I thought that Helmholtz had done it ... and that my failure was due only to my ignorance of electricity. It was a valuable blunder ... If I had been able to read German in those days, I might never have commenced my experiments!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MacKenzie2008&quot;&gt;MacKenzie 2003, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Groundwater 2005, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shulman 2008, pp. 46–48.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref| Helmholtz's ''The Sensations of Tone'' is credited with inspiring Bell, at age 23, to further his studies of electricity and electromagnetism.&lt;ref name=&quot;DictionaryOfCanBiography&quot; /&gt;|group=N}}

===Family tragedy===
In 1865, when the Bell family moved to London,&lt;ref&gt;Micklos 2006, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell returned to Weston House as an assistant master and, in his spare hours, continued experiments on sound using a minimum of laboratory equipment. Bell concentrated on experimenting with electricity to convey sound and later installed a [[telegraph]] wire from his room in Somerset College to that of a friend.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout late 1867, his health faltered mainly through exhaustion. His younger brother, Edward &quot;Ted,&quot; was similarly bed-ridden, suffering from [[tuberculosis]]. While Bell recovered (by then referring to himself in correspondence as &quot;A.G. Bell&quot;) and served the next year as an instructor at Somerset College, [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], England, his brother's condition deteriorated. Edward would never recover. Upon his brother's death, Bell returned home in 1867. His older brother Melville had married and moved out. With aspirations to obtain a degree at the [[University College London]], Bell considered his next years as preparation for the degree examinations, devoting his spare time at his family's residence to studying.

Helping his father in Visible Speech demonstrations and lectures brought Bell to Susanna E. Hull's private school for the deaf in [[South Kensington]], London. His first two pupils were &quot;deaf mute&quot; girls who made remarkable progress under his tutelage. While his older brother seemed to achieve success on many fronts including opening his own elocution school, applying for a patent on an invention, and starting a family, Bell continued as a teacher. However, in May 1870, Melville died from complications due to tuberculosis, causing a family crisis. His father had also suffered a debilitating illness earlier in life and had been restored to health by a convalescence in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. Bell's parents embarked upon a long-planned move when they realized that their remaining son was also sickly. Acting decisively, Alexander Melville Bell asked Bell to arrange for the sale of all the family property,&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|The family pet was given to his brother's family.|group=N}} conclude all of his brother's affairs (Bell took over his last student, curing a pronounced lisp),&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; and join his father and mother in setting out for the &quot;[[New World]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref2&quot;&gt;Groundwater 2005, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Reluctantly, Bell also had to conclude a relationship with Marie Eccleston, who, as he had surmised, was not prepared to leave England with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiref2&quot;/&gt;

In 1870, at age 23, Bell, his brother's widow, Caroline (Margaret Ottaway),&lt;ref&gt;Mackay 1997, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; and his parents travelled on the SS ''Nestorian'' to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie 1975, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; After landing at [[Quebec City]] the Bells transferred to another steamer to [[Montreal]] and then boarded a train to [[Paris, Ontario]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray-2006.b&quot;&gt;Gray 2006, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; to stay with the Reverend Thomas Henderson, a family friend. After a brief stay with the Hendersons, the Bell family purchased a farm of {{convert|10.5|acre|m2}} at Tutelo Heights (now called Tutela Heights), near [[Brantford]], Ontario. The property consisted of an orchard, large farm house, stable, pigsty, hen-house and a [[carriage house]], which bordered the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]].&lt;ref&gt;Mackay 1997, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref| The estate, dating from 1858, is in the present day located at 94 Tutela Heights Road, Brantford, and is now known as the &quot;Bell Homestead&quot;, and formally as the [[Bell Homestead National Historic Site|Bell Homestead National Historic Site of Canada]].

Bell's father was invited by Sarah Fuller, principal of the Boston School for Deaf Mutes (which continues today as the public [[Horace Mann School for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing|Horace Mann School for the Deaf]]),&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; in Boston, Massachusetts, to introduce the Visible Speech System by providing training for Fuller's instructors, but he declined the post in favor of his son. Traveling to Boston in April 1871, Bell proved successful in training the school's instructors.&lt;ref&gt;Town 1988, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently asked to repeat the program at the [[American School for the Deaf|American Asylum for Deaf-mutes]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], and the [[Clarke School for the Deaf]] in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]].

Returning home to Brantford after six months abroad, Bell continued his experiments with his &quot;harmonic telegraph&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander Graham Bell' 1979, p. 8&quot;&gt;''Alexander Graham Bell'' 1979, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|In later years, Bell described the invention of the telephone and linked it to his &quot;dreaming place&quot;.|group=N}}  The basic concept behind his device was that messages could be sent through a single wire if each message was transmitted at a different pitch, but work on both the transmitter and receiver was needed.&lt;ref name = &quot;Groundwater p. 39&quot;/&gt;

Unsure of his future, he first contemplated returning to London to complete his studies, but decided to return to Boston as a teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Petrina 1975, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  His father helped him set up his private practice by contacting [[Gardiner Greene Hubbard]], the president of the Clarke School for the Deaf for a recommendation. Teaching his father's system, in October 1872, Alexander Bell opened his &quot;School of Vocal Physiology and Mechanics of Speech&quot; in Boston, which attracted a large number of deaf pupils, with his first class numbering 30 students.&lt;ref&gt;Petrel 1975, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Town 1988, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;  While he was working as a private tutor, one of his most famous pupils was [[Helen Keller]], who came to him as a young child unable to see, hear, or speak. She was later to say that Bell dedicated his life to the penetration of that &quot;inhuman silence which separates and estranges.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Petrie 1975, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, Keller performed the sod-breaking ceremony for the construction of the new Bell's new [[Volta Bureau]], dedicated to &quot;the increase and diffusion of knowledge relating to the deaf&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schoenherr2005&quot;&gt;Schoenherr, Steven.

Several influential people of the time, including Bell, viewed deafness as something that should be eradicated, and also believed that with resources and effort they could teach the deaf to speak and avoid the use of [[sign language]], thus enabling their integration within the wider society from which many were often being excluded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller-Branson&quot;&gt;Miller and Branson 2002, pp. 30–31, 152–153.&lt;/ref&gt; In several schools, children were mistreated, for example by having their hands tied behind their backs so they could not communicate by signing—the only language they knew—in an attempt to force them to attempt oral communication. Owing to his efforts to suppress the teaching of sign language, Bell is often viewed negatively by those embracing [[deaf culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Ayers et al. 2009, pp. 194–195.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following year, Bell became professor of Vocal Physiology and Elocution at the [[Boston University]] School of Oratory. During this period, he alternated between Boston and Brantford, spending summers in his Canadian home. At Boston University, Bell was &quot;swept up&quot; by the excitement engendered by the many scientists and inventors residing in the city. He continued his research in sound and endeavored to find a way to transmit musical notes and articulate speech, but although absorbed by his experiments, he found it difficult to devote enough time to experimentation. While days and evenings were occupied by his teaching and private classes, Bell began to stay awake late into the night, running experiment after experiment in rented facilities at his boarding house. Keeping &quot;night owl&quot; hours, he worried that his work would be discovered and took great pains to lock up his notebooks and laboratory equipment. Bell had a specially made table where he could place his notes and equipment inside a locking cover.&lt;ref&gt;Town 1988, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Worse still, his health deteriorated as he suffered severe headaches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Groundwater p. 39&quot;&gt;Groundwater 2005, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Boston in fall 1873, Bell made a fateful decision to concentrate on his experiments in sound.

Deciding to give up his lucrative private Boston practice, Bell retained only two students, six-year-old &quot;Georgie&quot; Sanders, deaf from birth, and 15-year-old [[Mabel Gardiner Hubbard|Mabel Hubbard]]. Each pupil would play an important role in the next developments. George's father, Thomas Sanders, a wealthy businessman, offered Bell a place to stay in nearby [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] with Georgie's grandmother, complete with a room to &quot;experiment&quot;. Although the offer was made by George's mother and followed the year-long arrangement in 1872 where her son and his nurse had moved to quarters next to Bell's boarding house, it was clear that Mr. Sanders was backing the proposal. The arrangement was for teacher and student to continue their work together, with free room and board thrown in.&lt;ref&gt;Town 1988, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Mabel was a bright, attractive girl who was ten years Bell's junior, but became the object of his affection.

Mabel's exact age when she became deaf would later play a part in the debate on the effectiveness of [[Manualism and oralism|manual versus oral education for deaf children]], as children who are older at the onset of deafness retain greater vocalization skills and are thus more successful in oral education programs. Some of the debate centred on whether Mabel had to relearn oral speech from scratch, or whether she never lost it.|group=N}} she had learned to [[Lip reading|read lips]] but her father, [[Gardiner Greene Hubbard]], Bell's benefactor and personal friend, wanted her to work directly with her teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn 1990, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Invention of the telephone}}

By 1874, Bell's initial work on the harmonic telegraph had entered a formative stage, with progress made both at his new Boston &quot;laboratory&quot; (a rented facility) and at his family home in Canada a big success.{{#tag:ref| Quote: &quot;Brantford is justified in calling herself 'The Telephone City' because the telephone originated there. It was invented in Brantford at Tutela Heights in the summer of 1874.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander Graham Bell' 1979, p. 8&quot;/&gt;|group=N}} While working that summer in Brantford, Bell experimented with a &quot;[[phonautograph]]&quot;, a pen-like machine that could draw shapes of sound waves on smoked glass by tracing their vibrations. Bell thought it might be possible to generate undulating electrical currents that corresponded to sound waves.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews 1999, pp. 19–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell also thought that multiple metal reeds tuned to different frequencies like a harp would be able to convert the undulating currents back into sound. But he had no working model to demonstrate the feasibility of these ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Matthews 1999, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874, telegraph message traffic was rapidly expanding and in the words of [[Western Union]] President William Orton, had become &quot;the nervous system of commerce&quot;. Orton had contracted with inventors [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Elisha Gray]] to find a way to send multiple telegraph messages on each telegraph line to avoid the great cost of constructing new lines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieee.cincinnati.fuse.net/reiman/03_2005.htm &quot;A History of Electrical Engineering.&quot;] ''ieee.cincinnati.fuse.net''. Retrieved: December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; When Bell mentioned to Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders that he was working on a method of sending multiple tones on a telegraph wire using a multi-reed device, the two wealthy patrons began to financially support Bell's experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Town 1988, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Patent matters would be handled by Hubbard's [[patent attorney]], [[Anthony Pollok]].&lt;ref&gt;Evenson 2000, pp. 18–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1875, Bell and Pollok visited the famous scientist [[Joseph Henry]], who was then director of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], and asked Henry's advice on the electrical multi-reed apparatus that Bell hoped would transmit the human voice by telegraph. Henry replied that Bell had &quot;the germ of a great invention&quot;. When Bell said that he did not have the necessary knowledge, Henry replied, &quot;Get it!&quot; That declaration greatly encouraged Bell to keep trying, even though he did not have the equipment needed to continue his experiments, nor the ability to create a working model of his ideas. However, a chance meeting in 1874 between Bell and [[Thomas A. Watson]], an experienced electrical designer and mechanic at the electrical machine shop of Charles Williams, changed all that.

With financial support from Sanders and Hubbard, Bell hired Thomas Watson as his assistant,{{#tag:ref| Hubbard's financial support to the research efforts fell far short of the funds needed, necessitating Bell to continue teaching while conducting his experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, Brian. [http://www.bu.edu/bridge/archive/2001/09-14/bell.html &quot;Alexander Graham Bell: The BU Years.&quot;] ''B.U. Bridge,''  Vol. V, No. September 5, 14, 2001. Retrieved: March 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell was so short of funds at times that he had to borrow money from his own employee, [[Thomas A. Watson|Thomas Watson]]. Bell also sought an additional CAD$150 from the former [[Premier (Canada)|Premier of Canada]], [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], in exchange for 50% of the patent rights in the British Empire (Brown later retracted his offer to patent the telephone in the U.K. for fear of being ridiculed). The [[Bell Telephone Company#Predecessor to the Bell Company|Bell Patent Association]], composed of Hubbard, Sanders and Bell and which would become the precursor of the Bell Telephone Company (and later, [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]]), would later assign an approximate 10% interest of its shares to Watson,&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; in lieu of salary and for his earlier financial support to Bell while they worked together creating their first functional telephone.|group=N}} and the two of them experimented with [[acoustic telegraphy]]. On June 2, 1875, Watson accidentally plucked one of the reeds and Bell, at the receiving end of the wire, heard the overtones of the reed; overtones that would be necessary for transmitting speech. That demonstrated to Bell that only one reed or armature was necessary, not multiple reeds. This led to the &quot;gallows&quot; [[sound-powered telephone]], which could transmit indistinct, voice-like sounds, but not clear speech.

===The race to the patent office===
{{main|Elisha Gray and Alexander Bell telephone controversy}}
In 1875, Bell developed an [[Acoustic Telegraph|acoustic telegraph]] and drew up a [[patent application]] for it. Since he had agreed to share U.S. profits with his investors Gardiner Hubbard and Thomas Sanders, Bell requested that an associate in Ontario, [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], attempt to patent it in Britain, instructing his lawyers to apply for a patent in the U.S. only after they received word from Britain (Britain would issue patents only for discoveries not previously patented elsewhere).&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, pp. 158–159.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--not in the right article- belongs in the Gray and Bell controversy---NPOV involved--[[File:Bell-gray-smoking-gun.png|thumb|Excerpts from Elisha Gray's patent caveat of February 14 and Alexander Graham Bell's lab notebook entry of March 8, note their similarity]]---&gt;
[[File:TelephonePatentDrawingBell.jpg|thumb|right|Alexander Graham Bell's telephone patent&lt;ref&gt;{{Patent|US|174465|Alexander Graham Bell: &quot;Improvement in Telegraphy&quot; filed on February 14, 1876, granted on March 7, 1876.}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing, March 7, 1876.]]

Meanwhile, [[Elisha Gray]] was also experimenting with acoustic telegraphy and thought of a way to transmit speech using a water transmitter. On February 14, 1876, Gray filed a [[Patent caveat|caveat]] with the U.S. Patent Office for a telephone design that used a water transmitter. That same morning, Bell's lawyer filed Bell's application with the patent office. There is considerable debate about who arrived first and Gray later challenged the primacy of Bell's patent. Bell was in Boston on February 14 and did not arrive in Washington until February 26.

Bell's patent 174,465, was issued to Bell on March 7, 1876, by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent Office]]. Bell's patent covered &quot;the method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically ... by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sound&quot;&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod 1999, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; {{#tag:ref|A copy of a draft of the patent application is shown, described as &quot;probably the most valuable patent ever.&quot;|group=N}} Bell returned to Boston the same day and the next day resumed work, drawing in his notebook a diagram similar to that in Gray's patent caveat.

On March 10, 1876, three days after his patent was issued, Bell succeeded in getting his telephone to work, using a liquid transmitter similar to Gray's design. Vibration of the diaphragm caused a needle to vibrate in the water, varying the [[electrical resistance]] in the circuit. When Bell spoke the famous sentence &quot;Mr. Watson—Come here—I want to see you&quot; into the liquid transmitter,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/treasures/trr002.html &quot;Bell's Lab notebook I, pp. 40–41 (image 22).&quot;] ''loc.gov.'' Retrieved: July 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Watson, listening at the receiving end in an adjoining room, heard the words clearly.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod 1999, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Bell was, and still is, accused of stealing the telephone from Gray,&lt;ref&gt;Shulman 2008, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell used Gray's water transmitter design only after Bell's patent had been granted, and only as a [[proof of concept]] scientific experiment,&lt;ref&gt;Evenson 2000, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; to prove to his own satisfaction that intelligible &quot;articulate speech&quot; (Bell's words) could be electrically transmitted.&lt;ref&gt;Evenson 2000, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; After March 1876, Bell focused on improving the electromagnetic telephone and never used Gray's liquid transmitter in public demonstrations or commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;Evenson 2000, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of priority for the variable resistance feature of the telephone was raised by the examiner before he approved Bell's patent application. He told Bell that his claim for the variable resistance feature was also described in Gray's caveat. Bell pointed to a variable resistance device in Bell's previous application in which Bell described a cup of mercury, not water. Bell had filed the mercury application at the patent office a year earlier on February 25, 1875, long before Elisha Gray described the water device. In addition, Gray abandoned his caveat, and because he did not contest Bell's priority, the examiner approved Bell's patent on March 3, 1876. Gray had reinvented the variable resistance telephone, but Bell was the first to write down the idea and the first to test it in a telephone.&lt;ref&gt;Evenson 2000, pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Patent clerk|patent examiner]], Zenas Fisk Wilber, later stated in an [[affidavit]] that he was an alcoholic who was much in debt to Bell's lawyer, [[Marcellus Bailey]], with whom he had served in the Civil War. He claimed he showed Gray's patent caveat to Bailey. Wilber also claimed (after Bell arrived in Washington D.C. from Boston) that he showed Gray's caveat to Bell and that Bell paid him $100. Bell claimed they discussed the patent only in general terms, although in a letter to Gray, Bell admitted that he learned some of the technical details. Bell denied in an affidavit that he ever gave Wilber any money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=The Washington Post |title=Mr. Wilbur &quot;confesses&quot;|date= May 22, 1886|page=1|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Mr._Wilber_Confesses}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later developments===
Continuing his experiments in Brantford, Bell brought home a working model of his telephone. On August 3, 1876, from the telegraph office in [[County of Brant|Mount Pleasant]] five miles (eight&amp;nbsp;km) away from Brantford, Bell sent a tentative telegram indicating that he was ready. With curious onlookers packed into the office as witnesses, faint voices were heard replying. The following night, he amazed guests as well as his family when a message was received at the Bell home from Brantford, four miles (six km) distant, along an improvised wire strung up along telegraph lines and fences, and laid through a tunnel. This time, guests at the household distinctly heard people in Brantford reading and singing. These experiments clearly proved that the telephone could work over long distances.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod 1999, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alexander Graham Telephone in Newyork.jpg|thumb|Bell at the opening of the long-distance line from New York to Chicago in 1892.]]
Bell and his partners, Hubbard and Sanders, offered to sell the patent outright to Western Union for $100,000. The president of Western Union balked, countering that the telephone was nothing but a toy. Two years later, he told colleagues that if he could get the patent for $25&amp;nbsp;million he would consider it a bargain. By then, the Bell company no longer wanted to sell the patent.&lt;ref&gt;Fenster, Julie M. {{Wayback|date=20060311000120 |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/events/articles/web/20060307-alexander-graham-bell-telephone-patent-telegraph-elisha-gray-thomas-watson-gardiner-hubbard-western-union-thomas-edison.shtml |title=Inventing the Telephone—And Triggering All-Out Patent War }} ''AmericanHeritage.com, American Heritage'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell's investors would become millionaires, while he fared well from residuals and at one point had assets of nearly one million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Winfield 1987, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell began a series of public demonstrations and lectures to introduce the new invention to the [[scientific community]] as well as the general public. A short time later, [[Bell Telephone Company#Early promotional success|his demonstration of an early telephone prototype]] at the 1876 [[Centennial Exposition]] in [[Philadelphia]] brought the telephone to international attention.&lt;ref&gt;Webb 1991, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Influential visitors to the exhibition included Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil]]. Later Bell had the opportunity to demonstrate the invention personally to [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Sir William Thomson]] (later, Lord Kelvin), a renowned Scottish scientist, as well as to [[Queen Victoria]], who had requested a private audience at [[Osborne House]], her [[Isle of Wight]] home. She called the demonstration &quot;most extraordinary&quot;. The enthusiasm surrounding Bell's public displays laid the groundwork for universal acceptance of the revolutionary device.&lt;ref&gt;Ross 1995, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bell Telephone Company]] was created in 1877, and by 1886, more than 150,000 people in the U.S. owned telephones. Bell Company engineers made numerous other improvements to the telephone, which emerged as one of the most successful products ever. In 1879, the Bell company acquired Edison's patents for the [[carbon microphone]] from Western Union. This made the telephone practical for longer distances, and it was no longer necessary to shout to be heard at the receiving telephone.

In January 1915, Bell made the first ceremonial transcontinental [[telephone call]]. Calling from the [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]] head office at 15 Dey Street in New York City, Bell was heard by [[Thomas A. Watson|Thomas Watson]] at 333 Grant Avenue in San Francisco. The ''New York Times'' reported:

On July 11, 1877, a few days after the [[Bell Telephone Company]] was established, Bell married [[Mabel Gardiner Hubbard|Mabel Hubbard]] (1857–1923) at the Hubbard estate in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. His wedding present to his bride was to turn over 1,487 of his 1,497 shares in the newly formed Bell Telephone Company.&lt;ref&gt;Eber 1982, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, the newlyweds embarked on a year-long honeymoon in Europe. During that excursion, Alec took a handmade model of his telephone with him, making it a &quot;working holiday&quot;. The courtship had begun years earlier; however, Alexander waited until he was more financially secure before marrying. Although the telephone appeared to be an &quot;instant&quot; success, it was not initially a profitable venture and Bell's main sources of income were from lectures until after 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn 1990, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; One unusual request exacted by his fiancée was that he use &quot;Alec&quot; rather than the family's earlier familiar name of &quot;Aleck&quot;.

&lt;br&gt;
Marian was born only days after Bell and his assistant [[Charles Sumner Tainter|Sumner Tainter]] had successfully tested their new wireless telecommunication invention at their [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Laboratory]], one which Bell would name as his greatest achievement. Bell was so ecstatic that he wanted to jointly name his new invention and his new daughter [[Photophone]] (Greek: &quot;''light–sound''&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;Grosvenor &amp; Wesson&quot;&gt;Grosvenor and Wesson 1997, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carson-2007-gvttw&quot;&gt;Carson 2007, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell wrote:  &quot;Only think!—Two babies in one week!

The Bell family home was in Cambridge, Massachusetts, until 1880 when Bell's father-in-law bought a house in Washington, D.C., and later in 1882 bought a home in the same city for Bell's family, so that they could be with him while he attended to the numerous court cases involving patent disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Gray 2006, pp. 202–205.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell was a [[British subject]] throughout his early life in Scotland and later in Canada until 1882, when he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States. In 1915, he characterized his status as: &quot;I am not one of those hyphenated Americans who claim allegiance to two countries.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this declaration, Bell has been proudly claimed as a &quot;native son&quot; by all three countries he resided in: the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom&lt;!-- Bell also lived in London, so 'UK' is more appropriate than 'Scotland' --&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, pp. 471–472.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1885, a new summer retreat was contemplated. That summer, the Bells had a vacation on [[Cape Breton Island]] in Nova Scotia, spending time at the small village of Baddeck.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bethune&quot;&gt;Bethune 2009, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Returning in 1886, Bell started building an estate on a point across from Baddeck, overlooking [[Bras d'Or Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;Bethune 2009, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1889, a large house, christened ''The Lodge'' was completed and two years later, a larger complex of buildings, including a new laboratory,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bethune&quot; /&gt; were begun that the Bells would name [[Beinn Bhreagh]] (Gaelic: ''beautiful mountain'') after Alec's ancestral [[Scottish Highlands|Scottish highlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Tulloch 2006, pp. 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt;  {{#tag:ref|Under the direction of the Boston architects, Cabot, Everett and Mead, a Nova Scotia company, Rhodes, Curry and Company, carried out the actual construction.|group=N}} Bell also built the [[Bell Boatyard]] on the estate, employing up to 40 people building experimental craft as well as wartime lifeboats and workboats for the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] and pleasure craft for the Bell family. An enthusiastic boater, Bell and his family sailed a rowed a long series of vessels on Bras d'Or Lake, ordering additional vessels from the [[H.W. Embree and Sons]] boatyard in [[Port Hawkesbury, Nova Scotia]]. In his final, and some of his most productive years, Bell split his residency between Washington, D.C., where he and his family initially resided for most of the year, and at Beinn Bhreagh where they spent increasing amounts of time.&lt;ref&gt;MacLeod 1999, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the end of his life, Bell and his family would alternate between the two homes, but ''Beinn Bhreagh'' would, over the next 30 years, become more than a summer home as Bell became so absorbed in his experiments that his annual stays lengthened.

==Later inventions==
[[File:AG Bell 1.jpg|thumb|Alexander Graham Bell in his later years.]]
{{Commons|Alexander_Graham_Bell#Inventions|Bell's many inventions}}

Although Alexander Graham Bell is most often associated with the invention of the telephone, his interests were extremely varied. According to one of his biographers, [[Charlotte Gray (author)|Charlotte Gray]], Bell's work ranged &quot;unfettered across the scientific landscape&quot; and he often went to bed voraciously reading the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', scouring it for new areas of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Gray 2006, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; The range of Bell's inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators. These included 14 for the telephone and telegraph, four for the [[photophone]], one for the [[phonograph]], five for aerial vehicles, four for &quot;hydroairplanes&quot; and two for [[selenium]] cells. Bell's inventions spanned a wide range of interests and included a metal jacket to assist in breathing, the [[audiometer]] to detect minor hearing problems, a device to locate icebergs, investigations on how to separate salt from seawater, and work on finding [[alternative fuel]]s.

Bell worked extensively in [[medical research]] and invented techniques for teaching speech to the deaf. During his [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Laboratory]] period, Bell and his associates considered impressing a [[magnetic field]] on a record as a means of reproducing sound. Although the trio briefly experimented with the concept, they could not develop a workable prototype. They abandoned the idea, never realizing they had glimpsed a basic principle which would one day find its application in the [[tape recorder]], the [[hard disc]] and [[floppy disc]] drive and other [[magnetic medium|magnetic media]].

Bell's own home used a primitive form of air conditioning, in which fans blew currents of air across great blocks of ice. He also anticipated modern concerns with fuel shortages and industrial pollution. [[Methane]] gas, he reasoned, could be produced from the waste of farms and factories. At his Canadian estate in Nova Scotia, he experimented with [[composting toilet]]s and devices to capture water from the atmosphere. In a magazine interview published shortly before his death, he reflected on the possibility of using [[Photovoltaic module|solar panels]] to heat houses.

===Photophone===
{{main|Photophone}}
[[File:Photophony1.jpg|thumb|Photophone receiver, one half of Bell's wireless [[optical communication]] system, ca. 1880]]

Bell and his assistant [[Charles Sumner Tainter]] jointly invented a wireless telephone, named a [[photophone]], which allowed for the transmission of both sounds and normal human conversations on a beam of [[light]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SDU&quot;&gt;Jones, Newell.

Retrieved from the ''University of San Diego History Department'' website, November 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Both men later became full associates in the [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau#Laboratory projects|Volta Laboratory Association]].

On June 21, 1880, Bell's assistant transmitted a wireless voice telephone message a considerable distance, from the roof of the [[Franklin School (Washington, D.C.)|Franklin School]] in Washington, D.C., to Bell at the window of his laboratory, some {{convert|213|m|ft|-2}} away, 19 years before the first voice radio transmissions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carson-2007-gvttw&quot;&gt;Carson 2007, pp. 76–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce 1990, p. 338.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Groth&quot;&gt;Groth, Mike.

Bell believed the photophone's principles were his life's &quot;greatest achievement&quot;, telling a reporter shortly before his death that the photophone was &quot;the greatest invention [I have] ever made, greater than the telephone&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Phillipson, Donald J.C., and Laura Neilson.

===Metal detector===
[[File:Telephone Inventor’s Voice Heard in Restored Recording « Science World.theora.ogv|thumbnail|Bell's voice, from a [[Volta Laboratory and Bureau|Volta Laboratory]] recording in 1885. Restored by the Smithsonian in 2013.]]

Bell is also credited with the invention of the [[metal detector]] in 1881. The device was quickly put together in an attempt to find the bullet in the body of U.S. President [[James Garfield]]. According to some accounts, the metal detector worked flawlessly in tests but did not find the assassin's bullet partly because the metal bed frame on which the President was lying disturbed the instrument, resulting in static.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grosvenor and Wesson, p. 107&quot;&gt;Grosvenor and Wesson 1997, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  The president's surgeons, who were skeptical of the device, ignored Bell's requests to move the president to a bed not fitted with metal springs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grosvenor and Wesson, p. 107&quot;/&gt; Alternatively, although Bell had detected a slight sound on his first test, the bullet may have been lodged too deeply to be detected by the crude apparatus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grosvenor and Wesson, p. 107&quot;/&gt;

Bell's own detailed account, presented to the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 1882, differs in several particulars from most of the many and varied versions now in circulation, most notably by concluding that extraneous metal was not to blame for failure to locate the bullet. Perplexed by the peculiar results he had obtained during an examination of Garfield, Bell &quot;...proceeded to the Executive Mansion the next morning...to ascertain from the surgeons whether they were perfectly sure that all metal had been removed from the neighborhood of the bed. It was then recollected that underneath the horse-hair mattress on which the President lay was another mattress composed of steel wires. Upon obtaining a duplicate, the mattress was found to consist of a sort of net of woven steel wires, with large meshes. The extent of the [area that produced a response from the detector] having been so small, as compared with the area of the bed, it seemed reasonable to conclude that the steel mattress had produced no detrimental effect.&quot; In a footnote, Bell adds that &quot;The death of President Garfield and the subsequent ''post-mortem'' examination, however, proved that the bullet was at too great a distance from the surface to have affected our apparatus.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bell, A. 1882. &quot;Upon the electrical experiments to determine the location of the bullet in the body of the late President Garfield; and upon a successful form of induction balance for the painless detection of metallic masses in the human body.&quot; [https://archive.org/details/uponelectricalex00bell (Available at archive.org)].

===Hydrofoils===
{{Main|HD-4}}
[[File:Bell HD-4.jpg|thumb|Bell [[HD-4]] on a test run ca. 1919]]

The March 1906 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article by American pioneer William E. Meacham explained the basic principle of [[hydrofoil]]s and [[Hydroplane (boat)|hydroplanes]]. Bell considered the invention of the hydroplane as a very significant achievement. Based on information gained from that article he began to sketch concepts of what is now called a hydrofoil boat. Bell and assistant [[Frederick W. Baldwin|Frederick W. &quot;Casey&quot; Baldwin]] began hydrofoil experimentation in the summer of 1908 as a possible aid to airplane takeoff from water. Baldwin studied the work of the Italian inventor [[Enrico Forlanini]] and began testing models. This led him and Bell to the development of practical hydrofoil watercraft.

During his world tour of 1910–11, Bell and Baldwin met with Forlanini in France. They had rides in the Forlanini hydrofoil boat over [[Lake Maggiore]]. Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying. On returning to Baddeck, a number of initial concepts were built as experimental models, including the ''Dhonnas Beag'', the first self-propelled Bell-Baldwin hydrofoil.&lt;ref&gt;Boileau 2004, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The experimental boats were essentially proof-of-concept prototypes that culminated in the more substantial [[HD-4]], powered by [[Renault]] engines. A top speed of {{convert|54|mph|km/h}} was achieved, with the hydrofoil exhibiting rapid acceleration, good stability and steering along with the ability to take waves without difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;Boileau 2004, pp. 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, Dr. Bell hired Walter Pinaud, a Sydney yacht designer and builder as well as the proprietor of Pinaud's Yacht Yard in [[Westmount, Nova Scotia]] to work on the pontoons of the HD-4. Pinaud soon took over the boatyard at Bell Laboratories on Beinn Bhreagh, Bell's estate near [[Baddeck, Nova Scotia]]. Pinaud's experience in boat-building enabled him to make useful design changes to the HD-4. After the First World War, work began again on the HD-4. Bell's report to the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] permitted him to obtain two {{convert|350|hp|kW|abbr=off}} engines in July 1919. On September 9, 1919, the HD-4 set a world marine speed record of {{convert|70.86|mph|km/h|abbr=off}},&lt;ref&gt;Boileau 2004, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; a record which stood for ten years.

===Aeronautics===
{{Main|Aerial Experiment Association|AEA Silver Dart}}
[[File:AEA Silver Dart.jpg|thumb|AEA Silver Dart ca.&amp;nbsp;1909]]

In 1891, Bell had begun experiments to develop motor-powered heavier-than-air aircraft. The AEA was first formed as Bell shared the vision to fly with his wife, who advised him to seek &quot;young&quot; help as Alexander was at the age of 60.

In 1898, Bell experimented with [[tetrahedral]] [[box kite]]s and wings constructed of multiple compound [[tetrahedral kite]]s covered in maroon silk.{{#tag:ref|Bell was inspired in part by Australian aeronautical engineer [[Lawrence Hargrave]]'s work with man-carrying box kites.&lt;ref&gt;''Technical Gazette'', New South Wales, 1924, p.&amp;nbsp;46.&lt;/ref&gt; Hargrave declined to take patents on his inventions, similar to Bell's decision not to file patents on some of his inventions. Bell also chose maroon-colored silk as it would show up clearly against the light-colored sky in his photographic studies.|group=&quot;N&quot;}} The tetrahedral wings were named ''Cygnet'' I, II and III, and were flown both unmanned and manned (''Cygnet I'' crashed during a flight carrying Selfridge) in the period from 1907–1912. Some of Bell's kites are on display at the [[Alexander Graham Bell honors and tributes|Alexander Graham Bell National Historic Site]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ns1763.ca/victco/bellmusbbm.html &quot;Nova Scotia's Electric Scrapbook.&quot;] ''ns1763.ca''.

Bell was a supporter of [[aerospace engineering]] research through the [[Aerial Experiment Association]] (AEA), officially formed at Baddeck, Nova Scotia, in October 1907 at the suggestion of his wife [[Mabel Gardiner Hubbard|Mabel]] and with her financial support after the sale of some of her real estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gillis&quot;&gt;Gillis, Rannie.

The AEA's work progressed to heavier-than-air machines, applying their knowledge of kites to gliders. Moving to Hammondsport, the group then designed and built the ''[[AEA Red Wing|Red Wing]]'', framed in bamboo and covered in red silk and powered by a small [[Engine cooling|air-cooled]] engine.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips 1977, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 12, 1908, over [[Keuka Lake]], the biplane lifted off on the first public flight in North America.{{#tag:ref|&quot;Selfridge Aerodrome Sails Steadily for {{convert|319|ft|m}}.&quot; ''[[Washington Post]]'' May 13, 1908.|group=N}} {{#tag:ref| At 25 to 30 Miles an Hour.

However, the AEA had depleted its initial reserves and only a [[Mabel Gardiner Hubbard#Support to aeronautical research|$15,000 grant from Mrs. Bell]] allowed it to continue with experiments.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips 1977, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Lt. Selfridge had also become the first person killed in a powered heavier-than-air flight in a crash of the [[Wright Model A|Wright Flyer]] at [[Fort Myer]], [[Virginia]], on September 17, 1908.

Their final aircraft design, the ''[[AEA Silver Dart|Silver Dart]]'', embodied all of the advancements found in the earlier machines. On February 23, 1909, Bell was present as the ''Silver Dart'' flown by J.A.D. McCurdy from the frozen ice of Bras d'Or, made the first aircraft flight in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=|first1=|date=October 19, 1956|title=Link with Canadian Pioneers |journal=[[Flight International|Flight]] |volume=70|issue=2491|page=642|url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1956/1956%20-%201488.html|accessdate=August 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell had worried that the flight was too dangerous and had arranged for a doctor to be on hand.

&lt;!--Bell's work with Eugenics is still considered contentious. Any submissions to this section should be documented in the &quot;talk page&quot; associated with this article.--&gt;
Bell was connected with the [[eugenics]] movement in the United States. In his lecture ''Memoir upon the formation of a deaf variety of the human race'' presented to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] on November 13, 1883 he noted that congenitally deaf parents were more likely to produce deaf children and tentatively suggested that couples where both parties were deaf should not marry.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Alexander Graham.

In 1921, he was the honorary president of the [[Second International Congress of Eugenics]] held under the auspices of the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York. Organisations such as these advocated passing laws (with success in some states) that established the [[compulsory sterilization]] of people deemed to be, as Bell called them, a &quot;defective variety of the human race&quot;. By the late 1930s, about half the states in the U.S. had eugenics laws, and California's compulsory sterilization law was used as a model for that of [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Lusane 2003, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

Honors and tributes flowed to Bell in increasing numbers as his most famous invention became ubiquitous and his personal fame grew. Bell received numerous honorary degrees from colleges and universities, to the point that the requests almost became burdensome.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Alexander Graham Bell Family Papers.&quot; ''Library of Congress.''&lt;/ref&gt; During his life he also received dozens of major awards, medals and other tributes. These included statuary monuments to both him and the new form of communication his telephone created, notably the [[Bell Telephone Memorial]] erected in his honor in ''Alexander Graham Bell Gardens'' in [[The Telephone City|Brantford, Ontario]], in 1917.&lt;ref name=&quot;NAS&quot;&gt;Osborne, Harold S.

* &quot;The inventor is a man who looks around upon the world and is not contented with things as they are. He wants to improve whatever he sees, he wants to benefit the world; he is haunted by an idea. The spirit of invention possesses him, seeking materialization.&quot; (1891)&lt;ref name=&quot;DictionaryOfCanBiography&quot; /&gt;

He and Mabel occasionally attended Presbyterian services and sometimes Episcopalian, at which Mabel could follow the prayer book. Since otherwise she depended on Alec's interpreting, their church goings were rare; but their children attended Presbyterian services regularly. In 1901 Bell came across a Unitarian pamphlet and found its theology congenially undogmatic. &quot;I have always considered myself as an Agnostic,&quot; he wrote Mabel, &quot;but I have now discovered that I am a Unitarian Agnostic.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* &quot;Every town or city has a vast expanse of roof exposed to the sun. There is no reason why we should not use the roofs of our houses to install [[Solar water heating|solar apparatus to catch and store the heat]] received from the sun.
