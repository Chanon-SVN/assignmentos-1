A military '''armored''' (or '''armoured''') '''car''' is a wheeled [[vehicle armour|light armored vehicle]], lighter than other [[armoured fighting vehicle|armored fighting vehicle]]s, primarily being armored and/or armed for self-defense of the occupants. Other multi-axled wheeled military vehicles can be quite large, and actually be superior to some smaller tracked vehicles in terms of armor and armament.

==History==

===Armed car===
[[File:Simms Motor Scout 1899.jpg|thumb|[[Frederick Richard Simms|F.R. Simms]]' [[Motor Scout]], built in 1898 as an armed car.]]
The [[Motor Scout]] was designed and built by British inventor [[Frederick Richard Simms|F.R. Simms]] in 1898. It was the first armed petrol engine powered vehicle ever built. The vehicle was a [[De Dion-Bouton]] [[Quadracycle|quadricycle]] with a mounted [[Maxim gun|Maxim machine gun]] on the front bar. An iron shield in front of the car protected the driver.&lt;ref&gt;Macksey, Kenneth (1980). The Guinness Book of Tank Facts and Feats. Guinness Superlatives Limited, ISBN 0-85112-204-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early armed car was invented by [[Royal Page Davidson]] at [[Northwestern Military and Naval Academy]] in 1898 with the [[Davidson-Duryea gun carriage]] and the later [[Davidson Automobile Battery armored car]].

However, these were not 'armored cars' as the term is understood today, as they provided no real protection for their crews against any kind of opposing fire. They were also, by virtue of their small capacity engines, far less efficient than the cavalry and horse-drawn guns that they were intended to complement.

===First armored cars===
At the beginning of the twentieth century, the first military armored vehicles were manufactured, by adding armor and weapons to existing vehicles.

[[File:Simms Motor War Car 1902.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frederick Richard Simms|F.R. Simms]]' 1902 [[Motor War Car]], the first armored car to be built.]]
The first armoured car was the [[Motor War Car|Simms' Motor War Car]], designed by [[Frederick Richard Simms|F.R. Simms]] and built by [[Vickers#Vickers, Sons &amp; Maxim|Vickers, Sons &amp; Maxim]] of [[Barrow-in-Furness|Barrow]] on a special [[Coventry]]-built [[Daimler Company|Daimler]] chassis&lt;ref name=DCMB /&gt; with a [[Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft|German-built Daimler]] motor in 1899.&lt;ref name=DCMB /&gt; and a single prototype was ordered in April 1899&lt;ref name=&quot;DCMB&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author = Edward John Barrington Douglas-Scott-Montagu Baron Montagu of Beaulieu|author2=Lord Montagu|author3=David Burgess Wise| title = Daimler Century: The Full History of Britain's Oldest Car Maker| year = 1995| publisher = Haynes Publications| isbn = 978-1-85260-494-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prototype was finished in 1902,&lt;ref name=DCMB /&gt; too late to be used during the [[Boer Wars|Boer War]].

The vehicle had Vickers armour 6&amp;nbsp;mm thick and was powered by a four-cylinder 3.3-litre&lt;ref name=DCMB /&gt; 16 [[Horsepower|hp]] Cannstatt Daimler engine giving it a maximum speed of around 9 miles per hour (14.5&amp;nbsp;km/h). The armament, consisting of two [[Maxim gun]]s, was carried in two turrets with 360° traverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macksey|first=Kenneth|title=The Guinness Book of Tank Facts and Feats|year=1980|publisher=Guinness Superlatives Limited|isbn=0-85112-204-3|pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tucker|first=Spencer|title=The European Powers in the First World War|url=http://books.google.com/?id=gv3GEyB19wIC&amp;pg=PA65|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-8153-3351-X|pages=816}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a crew of four. Simms' Motor War Car was presented at [[the Crystal Palace]], [[London]], in April 1902.&lt;ref&gt;''Armoured Fighting Vehicules of the World'', Duncan, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charron Girardot Voigt 1902.jpg|thumb|right|The earliest French armored car - the [[Charron-Girardot-Voigt 1902]].]]
Another early armoured car of the period was the French [[Charron, Girardot et Voigt 1902]], presented at the ''Salon de l'Automobile et du cycle'' in [[Brussels]], on 8 March 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Gougaud| first = Alain| title = L'aube de la gloire: les autos mitrailleuses et les chars français pendant la Grande Guerre, histoire technique et militaire, arme blindée, cavalerie, chars, Musée des blindés| year = 1987| isbn = 978-2-904255-02-1| page = 11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle was equipped with a [[Hotchkiss machine gun]], and with 7&amp;nbsp;mm armour for the gunner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=PknxxLTNhU8C&amp;pg=PA5 ''Early Armoured Cars'' E. Bartholomew, p.4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gougaud, p.11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italians used armored cars during the [[Italo-Turkish War]].&lt;ref&gt;Crow, ''Encyclopedia of Armored Cars'', pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt; A great variety of armored cars appeared on both sides during [[World War I]] and these were used in various ways.

=== World War I ===
Generally, the armored cars were used by more or less independent car commanders. However, sometimes they were used in larger units up to squadron size. The cars were primarily armed with light machine guns. But larger units usually employed a few cars with heavier guns. As air power became a factor, armored cars offered a mobile platform for anti-aircraft guns.&lt;ref&gt;Crow, ''Encyclopedia of Armored Cars'', pg. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

The first effective use of an armored vehicle in combat was achieved by the [[Belgian Army]] in August–September 1914. They had placed [[John Cockerill (company)|Cockerill]] armour plating and a [[Hotchkiss machine gun]] on [[Minerva Armored Car]]s. Their successes in the early days of the war convinced the Belgian GHQ to create a [[Belgian Expeditionary Corps in Russia|Corps of Armoured Cars]], who would be sent to fight on the Eastern front once the western front immobilized after the [[Battle of the Yser]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philatelicdatabase.com/postal-history/wwi-belgium-armoured-car-division-in-russia/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wio.ru/tank/for-rus.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greatwardifferent.com/Great_War/Russia/Russia_00.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Naval Air Service]] dispatched aircraft to Dunkirk to defend the UK from Zeppelins. The officers' cars followed them and these began to be used to rescue downed reconnaissance pilots in the battle areas. They mounted machine guns on them&lt;ref&gt;''Band of Brigands'' p 59&lt;/ref&gt; and as these excursions became increasingly dangerous, they improvised boiler plate armoring on the vehicles provided by a local shipbuilder. In London [[Murray Sueter]] ordered &quot;fighting cars&quot; based on Rolls-Royce, Talbot and Wolseley chassis. By the time [[Rolls-Royce Armoured Car]]s arrived in December 1914, the mobile period on the Western Front was already over.&lt;ref&gt;''First World War'' - Willmott, H.P., [[Dorling Kindersley]], 2003, Pg. 59&lt;/ref&gt; As described below, they had a fascinating birth and long and interesting service.

More tactically important was the development of formed units of armoured cars, such as the [[Canadian Automobile Machine Gun Brigade]], which was the first fully mechanized unit in the history of the British Army. The brigade was established on September 2, 1914 in [[Ottawa]], as Automobile Machine Gun Brigade No. 1 by [[Raymond Brutinel|Brigadier-General Raymond Brutinel]]. The Brigade was originally equipped with 8 Armoured Autocars mounting 2 machine guns. By 1918 Brutinel's force consisted of two Motor Machine Gun Brigades (each of five gun batteries containing eight weapons apiece).&lt;ref&gt;P. Griffith p 129 &quot;Battle Tactics on the Western Front - The British Army's art of attack 1916–18 Yale university Press quoting the Official History 1918 vol.4, p42&lt;/ref&gt; The brigade, and its armoured cars, provided yeoman service in many battles, notably at Amiens.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron Pulsifer (2007). ' 'The Armoured Autocar in Canadian Service' ', [[Service Publications]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rolls-Royce Armoured Car was famously proposed, developed, and utilised&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Verdin|first=Lt.-Col. Sir Richard|title=The Cheshire (Earl of Chester's) Yeomanry|year=1971|publisher=Willmer Bros. Ltd|location=Birkenhead|pages=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by the [[Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster|2nd Duke of Westminster]]. He took a squadron of these cars to France in time to make a noted contribution to the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], and thereafter the cars with their master were sent to the Middle East to play a part in the British campaign in [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Palestine]] and elsewhere. These cars appear in the memoirs of numerous officers of the BEF during the earlier stages of the Great War - their ducal master often being described in an almost piratical style.

=== World War II ===

The British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) in the [[Middle East]] was equipped with [[Rolls-Royce Armoured Car]]s and Morris tenders. Some of these vehicles were among the last of a consignment of ex-[[Royal Navy]] armored cars that had been serving in the [[Middle East]] since 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, ''Iraq 1941'', pg. 40&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 1940 a section of the No. 2 Squadron RAF Regiment Company was detached to [[Archibald Wavell, 1st Earl Wavell|General Wavell’s]] ground forces during the first offensive against the Italians in Egypt. It is said{{By whom|date=July 2010}} that these armored cars became ‘the eyes and ears of Wavell’. During the actions in the October of that year the Company was employed on convoy escort tasks, airfield defense, fighting reconnaissance patrols and screening operations.

During the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]], some of the units located in the [[British Mandate of Palestine]]&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; were sent to Iraq and drove Fordson armored cars.&lt;ref&gt;Lyman, ''Iraq 1941'', pg. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;Fordson&quot; armored cars were Rolls-Royce armored cars which received new chassis from a [[Fordson]] truck in [[Egypt]].

Since the [[Treaty of Versailles]] did not mention armored cars, Germany began developing them early. By the start of the new war, the German army possessed some highly effective reconnaissance vehicles, such as the ''[[Schwerer Panzerspähwagen]]''.

The Soviet [[BA-64]] was influenced by a captured ''[[Leichter Panzerspähwagen]]'' before it was first tested in January 1942.

In the second half of the war, the American [[M8 Greyhound]] and the British [[Daimler Armoured Car]]s featured turrets with light guns (40&amp;nbsp;mm or less) mounted in turrets. As with other wartime armored cars, their reconnaissance roles emphasized greater speed and stealth than a tracked vehicle could provide, so their limited armor, armament and off-road capabilities were seen as acceptable compromises.

==Military use==

A military armored car is a type of [[armored fighting vehicle]] having [[wheel]]s (from four to ten large, off-road wheels) instead of [[Caterpillar track|tracks]], and usually light [[vehicle armor|armor]]. Armored cars are typically less expensive and on roads have better speed and range than tracked military vehicles. They do however have less mobility as they have less off-road capabilities because of the higher ground pressure. They also have less obstacle climbing capabilities than tracked vehicles. Wheels are more vulnerable to enemy fire than tracks, they have a higher signature and in most cases less armor than comparable tracked vehicles. As a result they are not intended for heavy fighting; their normal use is for [[reconnaissance]], command, control, and communications, or for use against lightly armed insurgents or rioters. Only some are intended to enter close combat, often accompanying convoys to protect soft-skinned vehicles.

Light armored cars, such as the British [[Ferret armoured car|Ferret]] are armed with just a machine gun. Heavier vehicles are armed with [[autocannon]] or a small tank gun. The heaviest armored cars, such as the German, World War II era [[SdKfz 234]] or the modern, US [[M1128 Mobile Gun System]], mount the same guns that arm medium tanks.

Armored cars are popular for peacekeeping or internal security duties. Their appearance is less confrontational and threatening than tanks, and their size and maneuverability is said to be more compatible with tight urban spaces designed for wheeled vehicles. However they do have a larger turning radius compared to tracked vehicles which can turn on the spot and their tires are vulnerable and are less capable in climbing and crushing obstacles. However when there is true combat they are easily outgunned and lightly armored. The threatening appearance of a tank is often enough to keep an opponent from attacking, whereas a less threatening vehicle such as an armored car is more likely to be attacked.

Many modern forces now have their dedicated armored car designs, to exploit the advantages noted above. Examples would be the [[M1117 Armored Security Vehicle]] of the [[United States|USA]] or [[Alvis Saladin]] of the post-World War II era in the [[United Kingdom]].

Alternatively, civilian vehicles may be modified into improvised armored cars in ''ad hoc'' fashion. Many militias and irregular forces adapt civilian vehicles into AFVs (armored fighting vehicles) and troop carriers, and in some regional conflicts these [[technical (fighting vehicle)|&quot;technicals&quot;]] are the only combat vehicles present. On occasion, even the soldiers of national militaries are forced to adapt their [[Gun truck|civilian-type vehicles]] for combat use, often using [[Improvised vehicle armour|improvised armor]] and scrounged weapons.
