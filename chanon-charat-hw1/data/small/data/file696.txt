'''''Amaranthus''''', collectively known as '''amaranth''',{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} is a [[cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] [[genus]] of [[annual plant|annual]] or short-lived [[perennial plant]]s. Some amaranth species are cultivated as [[leaf vegetable]]s, [[cereal]]s, and [[ornamental plant]]s. Most of the species from ''Amaranthus'' are summer annual weeds and are commonly referred to as [[pigweed]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Bensch&quot;&gt;Bensch et al. (2003).

Members of this genus share many characteristics and uses with members of the closely related genus ''[[Celosia]]''.

&quot;Amaranth&quot; derives from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀμάραντος}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%234949 Liddell &amp; Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, s.v. ἀμάραντος]&lt;/ref&gt; (''amarantos''), &quot;unfading,&quot; with the Greek word for &quot;flower,&quot; ἄνθος (''anthos''), factoring into the word's development as &quot;amaranth.&quot; The more accurate &quot;amarant&quot; is an archaic variant.

[[File:Día de muertos.jpg|thumb|Skull shapes made of amaranth and honey for [[Day of the Dead]] in Mexico]]

''Amaranthus'' shows a wide variety of morphological diversity among and even within certain species. Although the family ([[Amaranthaceae]]) is distinctive, the [[genus]] has few distinguishing characters among the 70 species included.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1095-8339.2007.00665.x | author = Juan et al. | year = 2007 | title = Electrophoretic characterization of ''Amaranthus'' L. seed proteins and its systematic implication | url = | journal = Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society | volume = 155 | issue = | pages = 57–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This complicates [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] and ''Amaranthus'' has generally been considered among systematists as a &quot;difficult&quot; genus.&lt;ref name = &quot;Costea&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.2307/3088717 | author = Costea M, DeMason D | year = 2001 | title = Stem morphology and anatomy in Amaranthus L.

Formerly, Sauer (1955) classified the genus into two subgenera, differentiating only between [[Plant sexual morphology#Individual plant morphology|monoecious]] and [[Plant sexual morphology#Individual plant morphology|dioecious]] species: ''Acnida'' (L.) Aellen ex K.R. Robertson and ''Amaranthus''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Costea&quot; /&gt; Although this classification was widely accepted, further infrageneric classification was (and still is) needed to differentiate this widely diverse group.

Currently, ''Amaranthus'' includes three recognized subgenera and 70 species, although species numbers are questionable due to [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] and species concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Judd et al. (2008). Plant Systematics: A Phylogenetic Approach, Third Edition. Sinauer Associates, Inc. Sunderland, MA&lt;/ref&gt; Infrageneric classification focuses on inflorescence, flower characters and whether a species is monoecious/dioecious, as in the Sauer (1955) suggested classification.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot; /&gt; A modified infrageneric classification of ''Amaranthus'' was published by Mosyakin &amp; Robertson (1996) and includes three subgenera: ''Acnida'', ''Amaranthus'', and ''Albersia''. The taxonomy is further differentiated by sections within each of the subgenera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mosyakin &amp; Robertson |year=1996 |title=New infrageneric taxa and combinations in ''Amaranthus'' (Amaranthaceae) |journal=Ann.

=== History ===
Known to the Aztecs as '''huauhtli''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Coe, S.D.|year=1994|title=America's First Cuisines|publisher=University of Texas Press|isbn=9780292711594|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=guKnUdrLhtYC}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is thought to have represented up to 80% of their caloric consumption before the conquest. Another important use of amaranth throughout [[Mesoamerica]] was to prepare ritual drinks and foods.
To this day, [[amaranth grain]]s are toasted much like popcorn and mixed with honey, molasses or chocolate to make a treat called ''alegría'', meaning &quot;joy&quot; in Spanish.
[[Diego Duran]] described the festivities for [[Huitzilopochtli]], whose name means &quot;hummingbird of the left side&quot; or &quot;left-handed hummingbird&quot;. (Real hummingbirds feed on amaranth flowers.) The Aztec month of [[Aztec calendar|Panquetzaliztli]] (7 December to 26 December) was dedicated to Huitzilopochtli.  People decorated their homes and trees with paper flags; there were ritual races, processions, dances, songs, prayers, and finally human sacrifices. This was one of the more important Aztec festivals, and the people prepared for the whole month. They fasted or ate very little; a statue of the god was made out of amaranth (''huautli'') seeds and honey, and at the end of the month, it was cut into small pieces so everybody could eat a little piece of the god. After the Spanish conquest, cultivation of amaranth was outlawed, while some of the festivities were subsumed into the Christmas celebration.

Because of its importance as a symbol of indigenous culture, its gluten-free palatability, ease of cooking, and a protein that is particularly well-suited to human nutritional needs, interest in grain amaranth (especially ''A. cruentus'' and ''A. hypochondriacus'') revived in the 1970s. It was recovered in Mexico from wild varieties and is now commercially cultivated. It is a popular snack sold in Mexico, sometimes mixed with chocolate or puffed rice, and its use has spread to Europe and parts of North America.  Amaranth and [[quinoa]] are called [[pseudograin]]s because of their flavor and cooking similarities to grains.

=== Amaranth seed ===
Several species are raised for amaranth [[pseudograin|&quot;grain&quot;]] in Asia and the Americas.

Ancient amaranth grains still used to this day include the three species, ''[[Amaranthus caudatus]]'', ''[[Amaranthus cruentus]]'', and ''[[Amaranthus hypochondriacus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Costea et al. (2006). Delimitation of ''A. cruentus'' L. and ''A. caudatus'' L. using micromorphology and AFLP analysis: an application in germplasm identification. Genetic Resources and Crop Evolution 53: 1625-1633.&lt;/ref&gt; Although amaranth was cultivated on a large scale in ancient Mexico, Guatemala, and Peru, nowadays it is only cultivated on a small scale there, along with India, China, Nepal, and other tropical countries; thus, there is potential for further cultivation in those countries, as well as in the U.S. In a 1977 article in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', amaranth was described as &quot;the crop of the future.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Marx (1977). Speaking of Science: Amaranth: A Comeback for the Food of the Aztecs? Science 198(4312): 40.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been proposed as an inexpensive native crop that could be cultivated by indigenous people in rural areas for several reasons:
# It is easily harvested.
# Its seeds are a good source of protein.  Compared to grains, amaranth is unusually rich in the essential amino acid  [[lysine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foodwiki.com/vprotein/default/chart?combo=1059|title=vProtein}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common grains such as wheat and corn are comparatively  rich in amino acids that amaranth lacks; thus, amaranth and grains can complement each other.&lt;ref name=mpoll&gt;De Macvean &amp; Pöll (1997). Chapter 8: Ethnobotany. Tropical Tree Seed Manual, USDA Forest Service, edt. J.A Vozzo.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foodwiki.com/vprotein/default/index?filter=all+foods&amp;opt=maximize+efficiency&amp;protein=25.0&amp;q=Amaranth%2C+uncooked|title=vProtein_Foodwiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tucker/&gt;
# The seeds of ''Amaranthus'' species contain about thirty percent more protein than cereals like rice, sorghum and rye.&lt;ref name=mpoll/&gt; In cooked and edible forms, amaranth is competitive with wheat germ and oats - higher in some nutrients, lower in others.&lt;ref name=usdamrth&gt;{{cite web|title=USDA nutrient database, search for: cooked amaranth, wheat germ, oats |url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/foodcomp/search/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# It is easy to cook.  
# As befits its weedy life history, amaranth grains grow very rapidly and their large seedheads can weigh up to 1 kilogram and contain a half-million seeds in three species of amaranth.&lt;ref name = &quot;Tucker&quot;&gt;Tucker, J. (1986). Amaranth: the once and future crop. Bioscience 36(1): 9-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Amaranth seed flour ===

Amaranth seed flour has been evaluated as an additive to wheat flour by food specialists. To determine palatability, different levels of amaranth grain flour were mixed with the wheat flour and baking ingredients (1% salt, 2.5% fat, 1.5% yeast, 10% sugar and 52–74% water), fermented, molded, pan-proofed and baked. The baked products were evaluated for loaf volume, moisture content, color, odor, taste and texture. The amaranth containing products were then compared with bread made from 100% wheat flour. The loaf volume decreased by 40% and the moisture content increased from 22 to 42% with increase in amaranth grain flour. The study found that the sensory scores of the taste, odor, color, and texture decreased with increasing amounts of amaranth. Generally, above 15% amaranth grain flour, there were significant differences in the evaluated sensory qualities and the high amaranth-containing product was found to be of unacceptable palatability to the population sample that evaluated the baked products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=THE EFFECT OF AMARANTH GRAIN FLOUR ON THE QUALITY OF BREAD|author=Jerome Ayo|doi=10.1081/JFP-100105198|journal=International Journal of Food Properties|year=2001|volume=4|issue=2|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1081/JFP-100105198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Leaves, roots, and stems ===

Amaranth species are cultivated and consumed as a [[leaf vegetable]] in many parts of the world. There are four species of ''Amaranthus'' documented as cultivated vegetables in eastern Asia: ''[[Amaranthus cruentus]]'', ''[[Amaranthus blitum]], [[Amaranthus dubius]]'', and ''[[Amaranthus tricolor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Costea (2003). Notes on Economic Plants. ''Economic Botany'' 57(4): 646-649&lt;/ref&gt;

In Indonesia and Malaysia, leaf amaranth is called ''bayam''. In the Philippines, the Ilocano word for the plant is &quot;kalunay&quot;; the Tagalog word for the plant is ''kilitis'' or &quot;kulitis&quot;. In the state of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in India, it is called Chaulai and is a popular green leafy vegetable (referred to in the class of vegetable preparations called [[saag]]). It is called Chua in Kumaun area of Uttarakhand, where it is a popular red-green vegetable. In Karnataka state in India, it is called Harive (ಹರಿವೆ). It is used to prepare curries like Hulee, palya, Majjigay-hulee and so on. In the state of Kerala, it is called 'Cheera' and is consumed by stir-frying the leaves with spices and red chillies to make 'Cheera [[Thoran]]'. In Tamil Nadu State, it is called முளைக்கீரை and is regularly consumed as a favourite dish, where the greens are steamed, and mashed, with light seasoning of salt, red chillis and cumin. It is  called ''keerai masial (கீரை மசியல்)''.  In Andhra Pradesh this leaf is added in preparation of a popular [[dal]] called ''thotakura pappu'' తొట కూర పప్పు ([[Telugu language|Telugu]]). In Maharashtra, it is called &quot;Shravani Maath&quot; (literally माठ grown in month of ''Shravan'') and it is available in both red and white colour. In Orissa, it is called &quot;Khada saga&quot;, it is used to prepare 'Saga Bhaja', in which the leaf is fried with chillies and onions.

The root of mature amaranth is a popular vegetable. It is white and cooked with tomatoes or tamarind gravy. It has a milky taste and is alkaline.

In China, the leaves and stems are used as a stir-fry vegetable, or in soups, and called 苋菜 (Mandarin [[Pinyin]]: xiàncài; Cantonese [[Jyutping]]: jin6 coi3) with variations in various dialects). Amaranth greens are believed to help enhance eyesight.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In Vietnam, it is called ''rau dền'' and is used to make [[soup]]. There are two species popular as edible vegetable in Vietnam: ''dền đỏ''- amaranthus tricolor and ''dền cơm'' or ''dền trắng''- amaranthus viridis.

A traditional food plant in Africa, amaranth has the potential to improve nutrition, boost [[food security]], foster rural development and support sustainable land care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |author=National Research Council |editor= |others= |title=Lost Crops of Africa: Volume II: Vegetables |url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11763 |format= |accessdate=2008-07-15 |edition= |series=Lost Crops of Africa |volume=2 |date=2006-10-27 |publisher=National Academies Press |location= |isbn=978-0-309-10333-6 |oclc= 34344933 79635740|doi= |id= |pages= |chapter=Amaranth |chapterurl=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11763&amp;page=35 |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In East Africa, amaranth leaf is known in [[Chewa language|chewa]] as ''bonongwe'', and in [[Swahili language|Swahili]] as ''mchicha'', as ''terere'' in [[Kikuyu language|Kikuyu]], [[Meru language|Meru]] and [[Embu language|Embu]]; and as ''telele'' in [[Kamba language|Kamba]]. In Bantu regions of Uganda it is known as ''doodo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | author=Goode, P. M. | title=Edible plants of Uganda | publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations  | year=1989| isbn= 9789251027134}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is recommended by some doctors for people having low [[Hematocrit|red blood cell count]]. It is also known among the [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] as a [[drought]] crop (''chepkerta''). In [[Lingala language|Lingala]] (spoken in the Congo), it is known as ''lɛngalɛnga'' or ''bítɛkutɛku''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | author=Enama, M. | year=1994 | title=Culture: The missing nexus in ecological economics perspective | journal=Ecological Economics | issue=10 | pages=93–95 | doi=10.1016/0921-8009(94)00010-7 | volume=10
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Nigeria, it is a common vegetable and goes with all Nigerian starch dishes. It is known in [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] as ''efo tete'' or ''arowo jeja'' (meaning &quot;we have money left over for fish&quot;). In the Caribbean, the leaves are called ''bhaji'' in Trinidad and ''callaloo'' in Jamaica, and are stewed with onions, garlic and tomatoes, or sometimes used in a soup called pepperpot soup.

In Greece, green amaranth (''[[Amaranthus viridis]]'') is a popular dish and is called βλήτα, ''vlita'' or ''vleeta''. It is boiled, then served with olive oil and lemon juice like a salad, sometimes alongside fried fish. Greeks stop harvesting the plant (which also grows wild) when it starts to bloom at the end of August.

In Sri Lanka, it is called &quot;koora thampala&quot;. Sri Lankans cook it and eat it with rice. Fiji Indians call it ''choraiya bhaji''.

=== Dyes ===

The flowers of the 'Hopi Red Dye' amaranth were used by the [[Hopi]] (a tribe in the western United States) as the source of a deep red [[natural dye|dye]].  There is also a synthetic dye that has been named &quot;[[Amaranth (dye)|amaranth]]&quot; for its similarity in color to the natural amaranth [[pigment]]s known as [[betalain]]s. This synthetic dye is also known as ''Red No. 2'' in North America and E123 in the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The following color additives are not authorized for use in food products in the United States: (1) Amaranth (C.I. 16185, EEC No. E123, formerly certifiable as FD&amp;C red No. 2);&quot; [http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~comm/cp03803.html FDA/CFSAN Food Compliance Program: Domestic Food Safety Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ornamentals ===
[[File:Amaranthus flowers.jpg|thumb|Amaranthus flowering]]
The genus also contains several well-known ornamental plants, such as ''Amaranthus caudatus'' (love-lies-bleeding), a native of [[India]] and a vigorous, hardy annual with dark purplish [[flower]]s crowded in handsome drooping spikes. Another Indian annual, ''A. hypochondriacus'' (prince's feather), has deeply veined lance-shaped leaves, purple on the under face, and deep crimson flowers densely packed on erect spikes.

Amaranths are recorded as food plants for some [[Lepidoptera]] ([[butterfly]] and [[moth]]) species including the [[Nutmeg (moth)|nutmeg moth]] and various case-bearer moths of the genus ''[[Coleophora]]'': ''C. amaranthella'', ''C. enchorda'' (feeds exclusively on ''Amaranthus''), ''C. immortalis'' (feeds exclusively on ''Amaranthus''), ''C. lineapulvella'' and ''C. versurella'' (recorded on ''A. spinosus'').

== Nutritional value ==

'''Amaranth greens''' are a common leaf vegetable throughout the tropics and in many warm temperate regions. See [[Callaloo]]

Cooked amaranth leaves are a good source of [[vitamin A]], [[vitamin C]], and [[folate]]; they are also a complementing source of other vitamins such as [[thiamine]], [[niacin]], and [[riboflavin]], plus some dietary minerals including [[calcium]], [[iron]], [[potassium]], [[zinc]], [[copper]], and [[manganese]]. Cooked amaranth grains are a complementing source of [[thiamine]], [[niacin]], [[riboflavin]], and [[folate]], and dietary minerals including [[calcium]], [[iron]], [[magnesium]], [[phosphorus]], [[zinc]], [[copper]], and [[manganese]] - comparable to common grains such as wheat germ, oats and others.&lt;ref name=usdamrth/&gt;

Amaranth seeds contain [[lysine]], an essential amino acid, limited in grains or other plant sources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wholehealthmd.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=17E09E7CFFF640448FFB0B4FC1B7FEF0&amp;nm=Reference+Library&amp;type=AWHN_Foods&amp;mod=Foods&amp;mid=&amp;id=7404261D57C74A058ACB873C7E17627F&amp;tier=2   Reference Library | WholeHealthMD&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify credibility|date=August 2014}} Most fruits and vegetables do not contain a complete set of amino acids, and thus different sources of protein must be used.

Amaranth may be a promising source of protein to those who are gluten sensitive, because unlike the protein found in grains such as wheat and rye, its protein does not contain [[gluten]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://glutenfreecooking.about.com/od/nutritionmealplanning/a/amaranth.htm 10 Reasons to Use Amaranth in Your Gluten-Free Recipes], by Teri Gruss, URL accessed Oct 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2007 report, amaranth compares well in nutrient content with gluten-free vegetarian options such as buckwheat, corn, millet, wild rice, oats and quinoa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The gluten-free vegetarian|journal=Practical Gastroenterology|date=May 2007|pages=94–106|url=http://www.practicalgastro.com/pdf/May07/May07PaganoArticle.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Recent advances in the formulation of gluten-free cereal-based products | journal = Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology | first = E. | last = Gallagher |author2=T.

Several studies have shown that like [[oat]]s, amaranth seed or oil may be of benefit for those with [[hypertension]] and [[cardiovascular disease]]; regular consumption reduces [[blood pressure]] and [[cholesterol]] levels, while improving [[antioxidant]] status and some immune parameters.&lt;ref&gt;

Amaranth remains an active area of scientific research for both human nutritional needs and foraging applications. Over 100 scientific studies suggest a somewhat conflicting picture on possible [[antinutrient|anti-nutritional]] and toxic factors in amaranth, more so in some particular strains of amaranth. Lehmann, in a review article, identifies some of these reported anti-nutritional factors in amaranth to be phenolics, saponins, tannins, phytic acid, oxalates, protease inhibitors, nitrates, polyphenols and phytohemagglutinins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legacy - The Official Newsletter of Amaranth Institute; see pages 6-9|publisher=Amaranth Institute|year=1992|url=http://www.ars-grin.gov/ars/MidWest/Ames/repository/oldsitearchive/Reports_New/Special_Reports/Amaranth/Legacy92.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, oxalates and nitrates are of more concern when amaranth grain is used in foraging applications. Some studies suggest thermal processing of amaranth, particularly in moist environment, prior to its preparation in food and human consumption may be a promising way to reduce the adverse effects of amaranth's anti-nutritional and toxic factors.

== Ecology ==

Amaranth weed species have an extended period of germination, rapid growth, and high rates of seed production,&lt;ref name = &quot;Bensch&quot;/&gt; and have been causing problems for farmers since the mid-1990s. This is partially due to the reduction in [[tillage]], reduction in herbicidal use and the evolution of herbicidal resistance in several species where herbicides have been applied more often.&lt;ref&gt;Wetzel et al. (1999). Use of PCR-based molecular markers to identify weedy Amaranthus species. Weed Science 47: 518-523.&lt;/ref&gt; The following 9 species of ''Amaranthus'' are considered invasive and noxious weeds in the U.S and Canada: ''A. albus'', ''A. blitoides'', ''A. hybridus'', ''A. palmeri'', ''A. powellii'', ''A. retroflexus'', ''A. spinosus'', ''A. tuberculatus'', and ''A. viridis''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=AMARA USDA Plant Database. Plants Profile- ''Amaranthus'' L]&lt;/ref&gt;

A new herbicide-resistant strain of ''[[Amaranthus palmeri]]'' has appeared; it is [[glyphosate]]-resistant and so cannot be killed by herbicides using the chemical. Also, this plant can survive in tough conditions.This could be of particular concern to [[cotton]] farmers using glyphosate-resistant cotton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.organicconsumers.org/ge/cotton060404.cfm Herbicide Resistant Weeds Causing Problems for US Cotton Growers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The species ''Amaranthus palmeri'' (Palmer amaranth) causes the greatest reduction in [[soybean]] yields and has the potential to reduce yields by 17-68% in field experiments.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bensch&quot;/&gt; Palmer amaranth is among the &quot;top five most troublesome weeds&quot; in the southeast of the United States and has already evolved resistances to [[dinitroaniline]] herbicides and [[acetolactate synthase inhibitor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Culpepper et al. (2006). Glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth (''Amaranthus palmeri'') confirmed in Georgia. Weed Science 54: 620-626.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the proper identification of ''Amaranthus'' species at the seedling stage essential for agriculturalists. Proper weed control needs to be applied before the species successfully colonizes in the crop field and causes significant yield reductions.

== Seed saving ==

There are a multitude of varieties which cross with one another very easily. Some species have been found to cross with one another e.g. ''Amaranthus caudatus'' and ''[[Amaranthus hypochondriacus]]''.
For most types, flowering occurs as the days become shorter.

Being wind-pollinated, they will cross with one another if less than 400 metres apart at flowering time. If the seed is to be used for planting, [[roguing]] is necessary to remove inferior individuals before they can flower and pollinate better plants.

The seed heads mature gradually from bottom to top, requiring harvesters to be selective when choosing plants for seed harvesting. Seed harvest is maximized by shaking the near-mature seed heads into a paper bag or onto a canvas. In large growing areas the heads are cut all at once when most of the seeds are ripe. Once the heads have fully ripened, they tend to drop their seeds, so harvesting is done just before this point.

Heads are then dried for a week and threshed with gloved hands or feet on canvas as the chaff is somewhat prickly. Care is required not to lose the seeds when winnowing because the chaff and seeds are of similar size and the seeds are of a light weight. Heaping uncleaned seeds in a bowl and tossing them will concentrate the light debris on the top, and it can then blow away. The process is repeated until only seeds remain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Fanton M., Fanton J. | year = 1993 | title = Seed Savers' Handbook | pages = 53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Myth, legend and poetry ==

The word '''amaranth''' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''amaranton'', meaning &quot;unwilting&quot; (from the verb ''marainesthai'', meaning &quot;wilt&quot;).&lt;ref name=Nagy_2013&gt;{{cite book|last=Nagy|first=Gregory|title=The Ancient Greek Hero in 24 Hours |year=2013 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, MA, USA |isbn=978-0674073401 |page=14§32 |quote=Technically, the blossoms that form the circles of these garlands come from the name of a flower known as ''amaranton'' or 'amaranth', which literally means 'unwilting' (from the verb ''marainesthai'', meaning 'wilt'). The blossoms of the flower ''amaranth'' that are plaited into garlands mimic eternity, since the blossom of the amaranth is observably slow in wilting, unlike the blossoms of most flowers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The word was applied to amaranth because it did not soon fade and so symbolized immortality. &quot;Amarant&quot; is a more correct, albeit archaic form, chiefly used in poetry. The current spelling, ''amaranth'', seems to have come from [[folk etymology]] that assumed the final syllable derived from the Greek word ''anthos'' (&quot;flower&quot;), common in botanical names.

An early Greek fable counted among [[Aesop's Fables]] compares the rose to the amaranth to illustrate the difference in fleeting and everlasting beauty:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:An amaranth planted in a garden near a Rose-Tree, thus addressed it:  &quot;What a lovely flower is the Rose, a favorite alike with Gods and with men.  I envy you your beauty and your perfume.&quot;  The Rose replied, &quot;I indeed, dear Amaranth, flourish but for a brief season! If no cruel hand pluck me from my stem, yet I must perish by an early doom.  But thou art immortal and dost never fade, but bloomest for ever in renewed youth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mythfolklore.net/aesopica/perry/369.htm Aesopica site]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In  [[John Milton]]'s epic ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' it is given a more fitting neighbour:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Immortal amaranth, a flower which once
:In paradise, fast by the tree of life,
:Began to bloom; but soon for man's offence
:To heaven removed, where first it grew, there grows,
:And flowers aloft, shading the fount of life,
:And where the river of bliss through midst of heaven
:Rolls o'er elysian flowers her amber stream:
:With these that never fade the spirits elect
:Bind their resplendent locks. (III, 353)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], in ''[[q:Samuel Taylor Coleridge#Work Without Hope (1825)|Work Without Hope]]'' (1825), also refers to the herb, likely referencing Milton's earlier work. (ll 7-10 excerpted):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Yet well I ken the banks where Amaranths blow,
:Have traced the fount whence streams of nectar flow.
:Bloom, O ye Amaranths! bloom for whom ye may,
:For me ye bloom not! Glide, rich streams, away!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Percy Bysshe Shelley]] refers to the herb in his poem &quot;Bereavement&quot; (Lines 13-16 excerpted):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Eternity points, in its amaranth bower
:Where no clouds of fate o'er the sweet prospect lour,
:Unspeakable pleasure, of goodness the dower,
:When woe fades away like the mist of the heath.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his dialogue &quot;Aesop and Rhodopè&quot;, published in 1844, [[Walter Savage Landor]] wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:There are no fields of amaranth on this side of the grave:
:there are no voices, O Rhodopè, that are not soon mute, however tuneful:
:there is no name, with whatever emphasis of passionate love repeated,
:of which the echo is not faint at last.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Joachim du Bellay]] mentioned the herb in his &quot;A Vow To Heavenly Venus,&quot; ca. 1500.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:We that with like hearts love, we lovers twain,
:New wedded in the village by thy fane,
:Lady of all chaste love, to thee it is
:We bring these amaranths, these white lilies,
:A sign, and sacrifice; may Love, we pray,
:Like amaranthine flowers, feel no decay;
:Like these cool lilies may our loves remain,
:Perfect and pure, and know not any stain;
:And be our hearts, from this thy holy hour,
:Bound each to each, like flower to wedded flower.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the fourth book&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/126/35.html|title=Endymion_Book IV}}&lt;/ref&gt; of ''[[Endymion (poem)|Endymion]]'', [[John Keats]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:The spirit culls	
:Unfaded amaranth, when wild it strays	
:Through the old garden-ground of boyish days.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ancient [[Greece]], the amaranth (also called [[chrysanthemum]] and [[helichrysum]]) was sacred to Ephesian [[Artemis]]. It was supposed to have special healing properties, and, as a symbol of immortality, was used to decorate images of the gods and [[tomb]]s. In legend, [[Amarynthus]] (a form of Amarantus) was a hunter of Artemis and king of [[Euboea]]; in a village of Amarynthus, of which he was the eponymous hero, there was a famous temple of Artemis Amarynthia or Amarysia (Strabo x. 448; Pausan. i. 31, p.&amp;nbsp;5). It was also widely used by the Chinese for its healing chemicals, curing illnesses such as infections, rashes, and migraines.  The ''&quot;Amarantos&quot;'' is the name of a several-century-old popular Greek folk song:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Look at the amaranth:
:on tall mountains it grows,
:on the very stones and rocks
:and places inaccessible.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
