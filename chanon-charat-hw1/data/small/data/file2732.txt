BT's origins date back to the founding of the [[Electric Telegraph Company]] in 1846 which developed a nationwide communications network. In 1912, the [[General Post Office]], a government department, became the monopoly telecoms supplier in GB. The Post Office Act of 1969 led to the GPO becoming a public corporation. '''British Telecommunications''', trading as British Telecom, was formed in 1980, and became independent of the Post Office in 1981. British Telecommunications was privatised in 1984, becoming '''British Telecommunications plc''', with some 50 per cent of its shares sold to investors. The Government sold its remaining stake in further share sales in 1991 and 1993.

BT has a primary listing on the [[London Stock Exchange]], a secondary listing on the [[New York Stock Exchange]], and is a constituent of the [[FTSE 100 Index]].

==History==
BT's origins date back to the establishment of the first telecommunications companies in Britain.  Among them was the first commercial [[Telegraphy|telegraph service]], the [[Electric Telegraph Company]], established in 1846. As these companies amalgamated and were taken over or collapsed, the remaining companies were transferred to [[Government-owned corporation|state control]] under the [[General Post Office|Post Office]] in 1912. These companies were merged and [[Rebranding|rebranded]] as British Telecom.&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/BTsHistory/History.htm | title = The historical development of BT | year = 2010 | accessdate =12 June 2010 | publisher=BT Group| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100527143141/http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/BTsHistory/History.htm| archivedate= 27 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1878 to 1969===
[[File:BT Tower-1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[BT Tower]], originally the Post Office Tower, constructed between 1961 and 1964]]
In January 1878 [[Alexander Graham Bell]] demonstrated his recently developed telephone to [[Queen Victoria]] at [[Osborne House]] on the [[Isle of Wight]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Linge&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=First helped put us in touch 135 years ago|last=Linge|first=Prof. Nigel|date=4 February 2013|work=Manchester Evening News|publisher=MEN Media|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later the first telephone in Britain was installed, under licence from the General Post Office, by engineers from David Moseley and Sons, to connect the Dantzic Street premises of [[Manchester]] hardware merchant, Mr. John Hudson, with his other premises in nearby Shudehill.&lt;ref name=&quot;Linge&quot;/&gt; As the number of installed telephones across the country grew it became sensible to consider constructing telephone exchanges to allow all the telephones in each city to be connected together. The first exchange was opened in London in August 1879, closely followed by the Lancashire Telephonic Exchange in Manchester.&lt;ref name=&quot;Linge&quot;/&gt; From 1878, the telephone service in Britain was provided by private sector companies such as the [[National Telephone Company]], and later by the General Post Office. In 1896, the National Telephone Company was taken over by the General Post Office. In 1912 it became the primary supplier of telecommunications services, after the Post Office took over the private sector telephone service in GB, except for a few local authority services. Those services all folded within a few years, the sole exception being  [[Kingston upon Hull]], where the telephone department became present day [[KCOM Group]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot;/&gt; Telegraph and Telephone services became the exclusive responsibility of the Post Office Engineering department.

===Public corporation===
Converting the Post Office into a nationalised industry, as opposed to a governmental department, was first discussed in 1932 by Lord Wolmer. In 1932 the Bridgeman Committee produced a report that was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btplc.com/thegroup/btshistory/1912to1968/1932.htm Bridgeman Committee]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961, more proposals were ignored. The Post Office remained a department of central government, with the [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]] sitting in [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] as a [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot;/&gt;

In March 1965, [[Tony Benn]], the acting [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]], wrote to [[Harold Wilson]], the Prime Minister, proposing that studies be undertaken aimed at converting the Post Office into a  [[State ownership|nationalised industry]]. A committee was set up to look into the advantages and disadvantages of the proposal, and its findings were found to be favourable enough for the Government to re-establish a Steering Group on the Organisation of the Post Office. After some initial deliberations that the business should be divided into five divisions; [[General Post Office|Post]], Telecommunications, [[National Savings and Investments|Saving]]s, [[Girobank|Giro]] and National Data Processing Services, it was decided that there should be two: ''Post'' and ''Telecommunications''. These events finally resulted in the introduction of the Post Office Act, 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot;/&gt;

On 1 October 1969, under the Post Office Act of 1969, the Post Office ceased to be a government department and it became established as a [[Public company|public corporation]]. The Act gave the Post Office the exclusive privilege of operating telecommunications systems with listed powers to authorise others to run such systems. Effectively, the General Post Office retained its telecommunications monopoly.&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot;/&gt;

=== 1969 to 1982 ===
[[File:British Telecom 1981.svg|thumb|150px|The British Telecom &quot;T&quot; symbol logo, used from 1980 to 1991]]
In 1977, the Carter Committee Report recommended a further division of the two main services and for their relocation under two individual corporations. The findings contained in the report led to the renaming of [[Post Office Telecommunications]] as British Telecommunications (trading as British Telecom) in 1980, although it remained part of the Post Office.&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot;/&gt;

The [[British Telecommunications Act 1981]] transferred the responsibility for telecommunications services from the Post Office, creating two separate corporations, [[Post Office Ltd.]] and British Telecommunications. At this time the first steps were taken to introduce competition into British telecommunications industry. In particular, the Act empowered the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, as well as British Telecommunications, to license other operators to run public telecommunications systems. Additionally, a framework was established which enabled the Secretary of State to set standards with the [[British Standards Institution]] (BSI) for apparatus supplied to the public by third parties, and had the effect of requiring British Telecommunications to connect approved apparatus to its systems. The Secretary of State made use of these new powers and began the process of opening up the apparatus supply market, where a phased programme of liberalisation was started in 1981. In 1982, a licence was granted to Cable &amp; Wireless to run a public telecommunications network through its subsidiary, [[Mercury Communications Ltd]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/mercury-communications-ltd-history/ History of Mercury Communications] fundinguniverse.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===1982 to 1991===
On 19 July 1982, the Government formally announced its intention to privatise British Telecommunications with the sale of up to 51% of the company's shares to private investors. This intention was confirmed by the passing of the [[Telecommunications Act 1984]], which received Royal Assent on 12 April that year. The transfer to British Telecommunications plc of the business of British Telecommunications, the statutory corporation, took place on 6 August 1984 and, on 20 November 1984, more than 50 per cent of British Telecommunications shares were sold to the public. At the time, this was the largest share issue in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressandstar.com/days/1976-2000/1984.html Tory conference bombed] Express and Star. Retrieved 24 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The new legislation was intended to enable British Telecommunications to become more responsive to competition in GB and to expand its operations globally. Commercial freedom granted to British Telecommunications allowed it to enter into new joint ventures and, if it so decided, to engage in the manufacture of its own apparatus. The company's transfer into the private sector continued in December 1991 when the Government sold around half its remaining holding of 47.6% of shares, reducing its stake to 21.8%. Substantially all the government's remaining shares were sold in a third flotation in July 1993, raising £5&amp;nbsp;billion for the Treasury and introducing 750,000 new shareholders to the company.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/8898538/Privatisation-shares-how-have-they-fared.html Privatisation shares – how have they fared?] The Telegraph, 18 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1984 Act also abolished British Telecommunications's exclusive privilege of running telecommunications systems and established a framework to safeguard the workings of competition. This meant that British Telecommunications finally lost its monopoly in running telecommunications systems, which it had technically retained under the 1981 Act despite the Secretary of State's licensing powers. It now required a licence in the same way as any other telecommunications operator.  The principal licence granted to British Telecommunications laid down strict and extensive conditions affecting the range of its activities, including those of manufacture and supply of apparatus.&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot;/&gt;

In 1985, [[Cellnet]] was launched as a subsidiary of Telecom Securicor Cellular Radio Limited, a 60:40 venture between British Telecommunications and [[G4S|Securicor]] respectively. Securicor originally invested £4&amp;nbsp;million in Cellnet in 1983. In 1999, BT purchased Securicor's shares in Cellnet for £3.15&amp;nbsp;billion. The company was later rebranded as BT Cellnet, and became a part of BT Wireless, a group of subsidiary companies owned by BT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/404792.stm | title= BT gobbles up Cellnet | date= 27 July 1999 | accessdate =1 May 2010 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major development for British Telecommunications, and a move towards a more open market in telecommunications, occurred in 1991. On 5 March, the Government's [[White Paper]], &quot;Competition and Choice: Telecommunications Policy&quot; for the 1990s, was issued. In effect, it ended the duopoly which had been shared by British Telecommunications and [[Mercury Communications]] in the UK since November 1983 and the build-up to privatisation. The new policy enabled customers to acquire telecommunications services from competing providers using a variety of technologies. Independent &quot;retail&quot; companies were permitted to bulk-buy telecommunications capacity and sell it in packages to business and domestic users. The White Paper was endorsed by British Telecommunications, the new policy enabling the company to compete freely and more effectively by offering flexible pricing packages to meet the needs of different types of customer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030859619190039E Competition and choice in telecommunications: The Duopoly review consultative document]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1991 to 2001===
[[File:BT old logo.svg|thumb|150px|The BT brand and piper logo were introduced in 1991. The logo remained until 2003.]]
On 2 April 1991, the company started using a new trading name, BT, and branding.&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot;/&gt;

In June 1994, BT and [[MCI Communications|MCI Communication Corporation]], the second largest carrier of long distance telecommunications services in the United States, launched [[Concert Communications Services]], a $1&amp;nbsp;billion joint venture company. This alliance gave BT and MCI a global network for providing end-to-end connectivity for advanced business services. Concert was the first company to provide a single-source broad portfolio of global communications services for multinational customers. On 3 November 1996, BT and MCI announced they had entered into a merger agreement to create a global telecommunications company called Concert plc, to be incorporated in GB, with headquarters in both [[London]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] As part of the alliance BT acquired a 20% holding in MCI. Nevertheless, following U.S. carrier [[WorldCom]]'s rival bid for MCI on 1 October 1997, BT ultimately decided in November, to sell its stake in MCI to WorldCom for $7&amp;nbsp;billion. The deal with WorldCom resulted in a profit of more than $2&amp;nbsp;billion on BT's original investment in MCI, with an additional $465&amp;nbsp;million severance fee for the break-up of the proposed merger.&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot;/&gt;

In December 2000, following modifications to BT’s licence in April 2000, BT offered [[local loop unbundling]] (LLU) to other telecommunications operators, enabling them to use BT’s copper local loops (the connection between the customer’s premises and the exchange) to connect directly with their customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silverlinings.eu/voice/telephone-lines/local-loop-unbundling/|title=Local loop unbundling|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2001 to 2006===
[[File:British Telecom offices in Madrid (Spain) 01.jpg|thumb|BT offices in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]]]
Following the [[dot com crash]], the group undertook a board restructuring and asset sale to address its large debts. In May 2001, BT announced a three-for-ten rights issue to raise £5.9&amp;nbsp;billion—still GB's largest ever rights issue—and the sale of [[Yell Group]], the international directories and associated e-commerce business, for £2.14&amp;nbsp;billion. Both activities were completed in June 2001. The group also sold its property portfolio to [[Telereal Trillium|Telereal]], a property company. 

BT renamed its BT Wireless division as [[O2 (United Kingdom)|O2]] in September 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1522609.stm | title = BT unveils new mobile brand | date=3 September 2001 | accessdate=20 December 2014 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and confirmed it planned to demerge the unit in November that year. Shareholders approved the demerger at a [[extraordinary general meeting]] held in Birmingham in October 2001, with 4.297&amp;nbsp;billion British Telecommunications shares voted in favour, and 0.67&amp;nbsp;million voted against.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1615100.stm | title = BT approves mobiles spin-off | date = 23 October 2001 | accessdate =1 April 2010 |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; BT Wireless demerged In 2001, and was relaunched on 18 June 2002 as O2. O2 was ultimately acquired by [[Telefónica]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityam.com/article/telefonica-says-it-has-no-plans-uk-float-o2|title=Telefónica says it has no plans for a UK float of O2|publisher=City AM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2003, BT unveiled its current corporate identity, known as the &quot;Connected World&quot;, and brand values.&lt;ref name=indep8403&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/bt-calls-up-a-new-logo-in-attempt-to-escape-from-arrogant-image-593715.html|title=BT calls up a new logo in attempt to escape from 'arrogant' image|accessdate=25 January 2012|work=The Independent |location=UK|date=8 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflecting the aspirations of a technologically innovative future, the connected world is designed to embody BT’s five corporate values: trustworthy, helpful, inspiring, straightforward, heart. The globe device part of the logo was originally designed by the [[Wolff Olins]] brand consultancy for BT's [[Concert Communications Services|Concert]] joint venture with [[AT&amp;T Corporation|AT&amp;T]], and was subsequently used by BT's internet division, Openworld, prior to being adopted by the company as a whole.&lt;ref name=indep8403/&gt;

The Communications Act, 2003, which came into force on 25 July 2003, introduced a new industry regulator, the Office of Communications ([[Ofcom]]), to replace the Office of Telecommunications ([[Oftel]]). It also introduced a new regulatory framework. The licensing regime was replaced by a general authorisation for companies to provide telecommunications services subject to general conditions of entitlement and, in some instances, specific conditions.  Under a specific condition BT retained its universal service obligation (USO) for GB, excluding the Hull area. The USO included connecting consumers to the fixed telephone network, schemes for consumers with special social needs, and the provision of call box services.&lt;ref name=&quot;BT History&quot;/&gt;{{dead link|date=April 2014}}

In the summer of 2004, BT launched Consult 21, an industry consultation for BT’s 21st century network (21CN) programme. [[21CN]] is a next-generation network transformation, that, at one time, was due for completion by the end of 2010. Using internet protocol technology, 21CN will replace the existing networks and communications from any device such as mobile phone, PC, PDA, or home phone, to any other device.&lt;ref&gt;[http://connectedplanetonline.com/home/news/bt_consulting_business_120606/ ITU: BT launches consulting business]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, BT was awarded the contract to deliver and manage N3, a secure and fast broadband network for the [[NHS National Programme for IT]] (NPfIT) program, on behalf of the [[English National Health Service]] (NHS).&lt;ref name=&quot;BT_2010&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/government-computing-network/2010/dec/20/doh-extends-n3-deal-with-bt-20dec10 |title=DoH extends BT N3 deal |date=20 December 2010 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 BT made a number of important acquisitions. In February 2005, BT acquired Infonet (now re-branded BT Infonet), a large telecoms company based in [[El Segundo, California]], giving BT access to new geographies. It also acquired the second largest telecoms operator in the Italian business market, Albacom. Then in April 2005, it bought Radianz from Reuters (now rebranded as BT Radianz), which expanded BT's coverage and provided BT with more buying power in certain countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0DUJ/is_/ai_n9772149 |title=BT goes home |publisher=Findarticles.com |date=1 December 2004 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006 to present===
In August 2006 BT acquired online electrical retailer [[Dabs.com]] for £30.6&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4956100.stm |title=BT buys on-line retailer Dabs.com |publisher=BBC News |date=28 April 2006 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BT Home Hub]] manufactured by [[Inventel]] was also launched in June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=105546 |title=Thomson ships BT home hub |publisher=Lightreading.com |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2006 BT confirmed that it would be investing 75% of its total capital spending, put at £10&amp;nbsp;billion over five years, in its new [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) based [[BT 21CN|21st century network]] (21CN). Annual savings of £1&amp;nbsp;billion per annum were expected when the transition to the new network was to have been completed in 2010, with over 50% of its customers to have been transferred by 2008. (For actual progress see [[BT 21CN]]). That month the first customers on to 21CN was successfully tested at [[Adastral Park]] in Suffolk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-155608023.html |title=BT transfers first customer lines to 21CN network |publisher=Highbeam.com |date=1 December 2006 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, BT acquired Sheffield-based ISP, [[PlusNet]] plc, adding 200,000 customers. BT stated that PlusNet will continue to operate separately out of its Sheffield head-office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thurston |first=Richard |url=http://news.zdnet.co.uk/communications/0,1000000085,39284743,00.htm |title=Bt buys PlusNet for CRM system |publisher=News.zdnet.co.uk |date=13 November 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 February 2007, BT announced agreed terms to acquire International Network Services Inc.

On 1 April 2009, BT Engage IT was created from the merger of two previous BT acquisitions, Lynx Technology and Basilica. Apart from the name change not much else changed in operations for another 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn-uk/news/1892864/exclusive-lynx-basilica-bt-rebrand|title=Exclusive: Lynx and Basilica in BT rebrand|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 May 2009, BT said it was cutting up to 15,000 jobs in the coming year after it announced its results for the year to 31 March 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8049276.stm BT to shed a further 15,000 job losses] BBC News, 14 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Then in July 2009 BT offered workers a long holiday for an up front sum of 25% of their annual wage or a one-off payment of £1000 if they agree to go part-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/8134123.stm |title=Bbc News |publisher=BBC News |date=4 July 2009 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2013, BT launched its first television channels, [[BT Sport]], to compete with rival broadcaster [[Sky Sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23527897 |title= BT launches sports TV channels in battle with Sky |publisher=BBC News |date=2013-08-01 |accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans for the channels' launch came about when it was announced in June 2012 that BT had been awarded a package of broadcast rights for the [[Premier League]] from the 2013–14 to 2015–16 season, broadcasting 38 matches from each season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18430036|title=Premier League rights sold to BT and BSkyB for £3bn|publisher=BBC News|date=2012-06-13|accessdate=2013-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, BT acquired [[ESPN Inc.]]'s UK and Ireland TV channels, continuing its expansion into sports broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2013/feb/25/espn-bt-vision|title=BT buys ESPN'S UK and Ireland TV channels|publisher=The Guardian|date=25 February 2013|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ESPN America]] and [[ESPN Classic (UK)|ESPN Classic]] were both closed, while [[ESPN (UK)|ESPN]] continued to be operated by BT.

==Operations==
[[File:BT Adastral Park, Ipswich, UK - geograph.org.uk - 39100.jpg|thumb|The [[Adastral Park]] campus at [[Martlesham Heath]] in Suffolk, the principal site of [[BT Research]].]]
BT Group is a [[holding company]]; the majority of its businesses and assets are held by its wholly owned subsidiary British Telecommunications plc.&lt;ref name=Groupbusinesses&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/Ourcompany/Groupbusinesses/index.htm|title=Group businesses|accessdate=20 December 2014|publisher=BT Group plc}}&lt;/ref&gt; BT's businesses are operated under special government regulation by the British telecoms regulator [[Ofcom]] (formerly [[Oftel]]). BT has been found to have significant market power in some markets following market reviews by Ofcom. In these markets, BT is required to comply with additional obligations such as meeting reasonable requests to supply services and not to discriminate.

BT runs the [[telephone exchange]]s, trunk network and [[local loop]] connections for the vast majority of British fixed-line telephones. Currently BT is responsible for approximately 28&amp;nbsp;million telephone lines in GB. Apart from [[KCOM Group]], which serves Kingston upon Hull, BT is the only UK telecoms operator to have a ''[[Universal service|Universal Service Obligation]],'' (USO) which means it must provide a fixed telephone line to any address in the UK. It is also obliged to provide public call boxes.

As well as continuing to provide service in those traditional areas in which BT has an obligation to provide services or is closely regulated, BT has expanded into more profitable products and services where there is less regulation. These are principally, broadband internet service and [[bespoke]] solutions in telecommunications and information technology.

==Corporate affairs==
=== Headquarters ===
[[File:BT Centre 3195 stitched.jpg|thumb|The BT Centre was completed in 1985.]]
{{Main|BT Centre}}
BT Group's world headquarters and [[registered office]] is the BT Centre, a 10-storey office building at 81 Newgate Street in the [[City of London]], opposite [[St. Paul's tube station]].

===Divisions===
BT Group is organised into the following divisions:&lt;ref name=Groupbusinesses/&gt;

*Customer facing:
**[[BT Global Services]] – provides IT and telecoms services to multinationals
**[[BT Business]] – provides telecoms services to UK [[Small and medium-sized enterprises|SMEs]]
**[[BT Consumer]] – provides retail telecoms services to consumers including TV and [[BT Sport]]
**[[BT Wholesale]] – operates BT's networks
**[[Openreach]] – fenced-off wholesale division, responsible for the &quot;last mile&quot; of BT's access network in GB and tasked with ensuring that rival operators have equality of access to BT's local network

*Internal service unit:
**BT Technology, Service &amp; Operations – responsible for the innovation, design, test, build and running of BT’s global networks and systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/Ourcompany/Groupbusinesses/index.htm|title=Group businesses|accessdate=7 November 2014|publisher=BT Group plc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Openreach====
[[Openreach]] was established following the Telecommunications Strategic Review carried out by Ofcom. BT signed legally binding undertakings with Ofcom in September 2005 to help create a new regulatory framework for BT and the British telecoms industry generally. Openreach commenced operations on 11 January 2006, with 25,000 engineers previously employed by BT's Retail and Wholesale divisions. It provides provision and repair in the &quot;[[last mile]]&quot; of copper wire and is designed to ensure that other communications providers (CPs) have exactly the same operational conditions as parts of the BT Group.

===Pension fund===
BT has the largest [[defined benefit pension plan]] of any UK public company.  The trustees valued the scheme at £36.7&amp;nbsp;billion at the end of 2010;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btpensions.net/41/scheme-report-and-accounts|title=BT Pension scheme Report and Accounts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An actuarial valuation valued the deficit of the scheme at £9.043&amp;nbsp;billion as of 31 December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

    | title = BT Pension Scheme Valuation 2008
    | accessdate =4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However following a change in the regulations governing inflation index linking, the deficit was estimated at £5.2&amp;nbsp;billion in November 2010.&lt;ref name=DeficitFall&gt;{{cite web

    | accessdate =14 March 2011
    | work=The Daily Telegraph
    | location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;
BT and the Trustee have agreed a 17-year recovery plan with the first three years’ payments amounting to £525M. As of 2013 average annual payments have been estimated at £533M. The next triennial valuation is scheduled for 2014.

BT’s pension obligation is derived from two pension plans: [[BTPS]], the company’s defined-benefit pension scheme which was closed in 2001, and the BT Retirement Saving Scheme (BTRSS), which was set up to replace the BTPS and is a defined-contribution retirement plan.

== Environmental record ==
In 2004 the BT Group signed the world's largest renewable energy deal with [[npower (UK)|npower]] and [[Centrica|British Gas]], and now all of their exchanges, satellite networks and offices are powered by renewable energy.  BT is a member of the Corporate Leaders Group on Climate Change. They signed a letter urging the government to do more to tackle this problem.  Janet Blake, head of global [[corporate social responsibility]] at BT, says that she would like to see incentives that find ways of rewarding those companies that focus on climate change by making investments in green business models.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itweek.co.uk/business-green/analysis/2199869/interview-csr-delivers-2bn-bt Interview: CSR delivers £2.2bn for BT – 30 October 2006 – IT Week&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

BT has made it clear that it has an ambitious plan to reduce [[carbon dioxide]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/Societyandenvironment/Climatechange/Climatechange.htm |title=Climate change |publisher=BT Group |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its strategy includes steps to reduce the company's carbon footprint as well as those of customers, suppliers and employees. BT has actually pledged to achieve an 80% reduction by the year 2016, which will require further efficiency improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/ClimateChange/WhatsBTdoing/Visionandstrategy/index.htm |title=Climate change – BT's Vision and Strategy |publisher=BT Group |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

=== World Wide Web hyperlink patent ===
In 2001, BT discovered it owned a patent ({{US patent|4873662}}) which it believed gave it patent rights on the use of [[hyperlink]] technology on the [[World Wide Web]]. The corresponding UK patent had already expired, but the U.S. patent was valid until 2006. On 11 February 2002, BT began a court case relating to its claims in a U.S. federal court against the [[Internet service provider]] [[Prodigy (ISP)|Prodigy Communications Corporation]].  In the case ''[[British Telecommunications Plc. v. Prodigy]]'', the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] ruled on 22 August 2002 that the BT patent was not applicable to web technology and granted Prodigy's request for [[summary judgment]] of non-infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nswscl.org.au/journal/51/Glen_Sauer.html |title=BT’s &quot;Hyperlinking&quot; Patent Litigation Fails |publisher=Nswscl.org.au |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavioural targeting===
{{See also|Data pimping}}
In early 2008 it was announced that BT had entered into a contract (along with [[Virgin Media]] and [[TalkTalk Group|TalkTalk]]) with the [[spyware]] company [[Phorm]] (responsible under their 121Media guise for the Apropos [[rootkit]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.f-secure.com/sw-desc/apropos.shtml F-Secure Spyware Information Pages: Apropos]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f-secure.com/sw-desc/peopleonpage.shtml |title=F-Secure Spyware Information Pages: PeopleOnPage |publisher=F-secure.com |accessdate=18 April 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110524153535/http://www.f-secure.com/sw-desc/peopleonpage.shtml| archivedate= 24 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; to intercept and analyse their users' click-stream data and sell the anonymised aggregate information as part of Phorm's OIX advertising service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Chris |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/25/phorm_isp_advertising/page2.html |title=ISP data deal with former 'spyware' boss triggers privacy fears |work=The Register |date=25 February 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Chris |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/02/29/phorm_documents/ |title=How Phorm plans to tap your internet connection |work=The Register |date=29 February 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice, known as &quot;[[behavioural targeting]]&quot; and condemned by critics as &quot;[[data pimping]]&quot;, came under intense fire from various internet communities and other interested-parties who believe that the interception of data without the consent of users and web site owners is illegal under UK law (RIPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-home/article-23449601-details/Web+users+angry+at+ISPs%27+spyware+tie-up/article.do |title=Web users angry at ISPs' spyware tie-up |work=Evening Standard |location=London |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Chris |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/03/04/phorm_ripa/ |title=Data pimping: surveillance expert raises illegal wiretap worries |work=The Register |date=4 March 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Chris |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/03/17/phorm_fipr_illegal/ |title=Net think thank: Phorm is illegal |work=The Register |date=17 March 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fipr.org/080423phormlegal.pdf |title=The Phorm &quot;Webwise&quot; System – a Legal Analysis |format=PDF |accessdate=18 April 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110522062819/http://www.fipr.org/080423phormlegal.pdf| archivedate= 22 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a more fundamental level, many have argued that the ISPs and Phorm have no right to sell a commodity (a user's data, and the copyright content of web sites) to which they have no claim of ownership. In response to questions about Phorm and the interception of data by the Webwise system [[Sir Tim Berners-Lee]], credited as the creator of the World Wide Web protocol, indicated his disapproval of the concept and is quoted as saying of his data and web history:

{{quotation|It's mine – you can't have it. If you want to use it for something, then you have to negotiate with me. I have to agree, I have to understand what I'm getting in return. I myself feel that it is very important that my ISP supplies internet to my house like the water company supplies water to my house. It supplies connectivity with no strings attached. My ISP doesn't control which websites I go to, it doesn't monitor which websites I go to.
|Sir Tim Berners-Lee, 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Cellan-Jones |first=Rory |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7299875.stm |title=Web creator rejects net tracking |publisher=BBC News |date=17 March 2008 |accessdate=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Alleged complicity with drone strikes in Yemen and Somalia===
In September 2012, BT entered into a $23 million deal with the US military to provide a key communications cable connecting [[RAF Croughton]], a US military base on UK soil, with [[Camp Lemonnier]], a large US base in Djibouti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbo.gov/index?s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;tab=core&amp;id=bb6b01958cbe2c2150d56ff874d2dac4&amp;_cview=0 |title=Contract Award Notice |publisher=Procurement Directorate, Defense Information Systems Agency |date=26 September 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camp Lemonnier is used as a base for American drone attacks in Yemen and Somalia, and has been described by The Economist as &quot;the most important base for drone operations outside the war zone of Afghanistan.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/news/international/21565614-america-uses-drones-lot-secret-and-largely-unencumbered-declared-rules-worries |title=Death From Afar |publisher=The Economist |date=3 November 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human rights groups including [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]] and [[Amnesty International]] have criticised the use of armed drones outside declared war zones. Evidence produced by [[The Bureau of Investigative Journalism]] and [[Stanford University]]'s International Human Rights &amp; Conflict Resolution Clinic suggest that drone strikes have caused substantial civilian casualties, and may be illegal under international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/07/02/resources-and-graphs/ |title=Pakistan Drone Statistics Visualised |publisher=The Bureau of Investigative Journalism |date=2 July 2012 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livingunderdrones.org/ |title=Living Under Drones |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, BT was the subject of a complaint to the [[Department of Business, Innovation and Skills]] under the [[OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises]], following their refusal to explain whether or not their infrastructure was used to facilitate drone strikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reprieve.org.uk/media/downloads/2013_07_15_PUB_Complaint_to_UK_NCP_re_BT_plc.pdf |title=Complaint to UK National Contact Point |publisher=Reprieve |date=15 July 2013 |accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent refusal of this complaint was appealed in May 2014, on the basis that the UK National Contact Point’s decision did not follow the OECD Guidelines. The issue of bias was also raised, due to the appointment of Lord Ian Livingston as government minister for the department which processed the complaint: Livingston had occupied a senior position at BT when the cable between RAF Croughton and Camp Lemonnier was originally built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/exclusive-minister-in-row-over-bts-link-to-us-drones-war-9215364.html |title=Minister in row over BT’s link to US drones’ war |publisher=The Independent |date=26 March 2014 |accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
