== Music videos ==

Diab is one of the first singers to popularise music videos in the Arab world and the first Egyptian singer to appear in music videos.&lt;ref name=tinge/&gt;

His music video for &quot;N'eoul Eih&quot; was released on 14 August 2007 on Rotana TV.

== Film career ==

Diab's fame in the music industry has led him to experiment with other forms of media, such as film. Amr played himself in his first film, ''El Afareet'', which was released in 1989. It also starred Madiha Kamel. His second film ''Ice Cream in Gleam'' (''Ays Krim fi Glym''), in which Diab starred in 1992, was chosen as one of the best five Egyptian musical films by the [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television]]. The film was featured in the UCLA Film and Television Archive's new program &quot;Music on the Nile: Fifty Years of Egyptian Musical Films&quot; at James Bridges Theater at UCLA on 6, 8 and 10 April 1999. David Chute of the ''Los Angeles Weekly'' termed it &quot;observant&quot; and &quot;a big leap&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= David |last= Chute |author2=Irene G. Behnan |title= All Singing! All Belly-Dancing |url= http://www.laweekly.com/1999-04-08/film-tv/all-singing-all-belly-dancing/2 |work= Los Angeles Weekly |date= 8 April 1999 |accessdate=4 June 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090627134412/http://www.laweekly.com/1999-04-08/film-tv/all-singing-all-belly-dancing/2| archivedate= 27 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His third movie was released in 1993, and was named ''Deahk We La'ab'' (''Laughter and Fun''). The film premiered in the Egyptian Film Festival in 1993. Amr played alongside international Egyptian movie star [[Omar Sharif]] (''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'', ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'') and [[Yousra]]. Overall, Diab did not experience the same level of success in film that he had with his music career. Since 1993, Diab has focused on his singing career.

== Egyptian Revolution ==

During the 2011 uprising, some protesters criticized Diab for staying silent, and for fleeing Egypt for London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egyptian celebrities face protesters' wrath in post-Mubarak Egypt|url=http://www.aawsat.net/2011/02/article55247479|work=Asharq al-awsat, 18 February 2011|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few days after former President [[Hosni Mubarak]] stepped down, Amr Diab composed and sang a memorial song, &quot;Masr A'let&quot; (Egypt Said Its Word),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsxyHbWY71s&lt;/ref&gt; and released it in conjunction with a music video showing pictures of the martyrs who died in the [[2011 Egyptian revolution|uprising]]. He also initiated a charity campaign &quot;Masry Begad&quot; (&quot;Real Egyptian&quot;), a social national program aimed at serving and rebuilding Egyptian society. His online radio station Diab FM often presents talks and discussions about what the Diab FM team can offer to the community as well as applying it practically by being present in different sites across Egypt with a new humanitarian project each week.&lt;ref&gt;http://diabfm.com/masry-begad&lt;/ref&gt;
