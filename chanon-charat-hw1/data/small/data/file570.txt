The original '''Apple Computer''', also known retroactively as the '''Apple I''', or '''Apple-1''', was released by the Apple Computer Company (now [[Apple Inc.]]) in 1976. They were designed and [[Handicraft|hand-built]] by [[Steve Wozniak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.oneindia.in/2006/09/27/co-founder-tells-his-side-of-apple-story-1159346150.html |title=Co-founder tells his side of Apple story |publisher=Reuters |date=September 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6167297 NPR : A Chat with Computing Pioneer Steve Wozniak]&lt;/ref&gt; Wozniak's friend [[Steve Jobs]] had the idea of selling the computer.

==History==
[[File:Apple 1 Advertisement Oct 1976.jpg|thumb|left|Introductory advertisement for the Apple I Computer]]
On March 5, 1975 Steve Wozniak attended the first meeting of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]] in Gordon French's garage. He was so inspired that he immediately set to work on what would become the Apple I computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wozniak |first=Steve |title=iWoz |year=2006 |publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company |isbn=978-0-393-33043-4 |page=150|quote=After my first meeting, I started designing the computer that would later be known as the Apple I. It was that inspiring.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wozniak calculated that laying out his design would cost $1,000 and parts would cost another $20 per computer; he hoped to recoup his costs if 50 people bought his design for $40 each. His friend [[Steve Jobs]] obtained an order from a local computer store the [[Byte Shop]] the affordable computer store in Mt. View California for 50 computers at $500 each. To fulfill the $25,000 order, they obtained $20,000 in parts at [[30 days net]] and delivered the finished product in 10 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;wozniak198412&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-12/1984_12_BYTE_09-13_Communications#page/n461/mode/2up | title=The Apple Story / Part 1: Early History | work=BYTE | date=December 1984 | accessdate=October 23, 2013 | author=Williams, Gregg; Moore, Rob | pages=A67 | type=interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apple I went on sale in July 1976 at a price of {{USD|666.66}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/1606-2-5937610.html|title=Video: Wozniak: $666.66 seemed like a good idea|date=November 7, 2005|publisher=CNET News|accessdate=February 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; because Wozniak &quot;liked repeating digits&quot; and because of a one-third markup on the $500 wholesale price.&lt;ref name=&quot;iWoz&quot;&gt;[[Steve Wozniak|Wozniak, Steven]]: &quot;[[iWoz]]&quot;, page 180. [[W. W. Norton]], 2006. ISBN 978-0-393-06143-7&lt;/ref&gt; About 200 units were produced and all but 25 were sold during nine or ten months.{{r|wozniak198412}} Unlike other hobbyist computers of its day, which were sold as kits, the Apple I was a fully assembled circuit board containing about 60+ chips. However, to make a working computer, users still had to add a case, power supply transformers, power switch, ASCII keyboard, and composite video display. An optional board providing a cassette interface for storage was later released at the cost of $72.

The Apple I's built-in [[computer terminal]] circuitry was distinctive. All one needed was a [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] and an inexpensive [[television set]]. Competing machines such as the [[Altair 8800]] generally were programmed with front-mounted toggle switches and used indicator lights (red [[light-emitting diode|LEDs]], most commonly) for output, and had to be extended with separate hardware to allow connection to a computer terminal or a [[ASR33|teletypewriter machine]]. This made the Apple I an innovative machine for its day. In April 1977 the price was dropped to $475.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.applefritter.com/node/2703 April 1977 Price List | Applefritter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It continued to be sold through August 1977, despite the introduction of the [[Apple II]] in April 1977, which began shipping in June of that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.applefritter.com/node/2715 Bill of Sale | Applefritter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Apple dropped the Apple I from its price list by October 1977, officially discontinuing it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.applefritter.com/node/2707 October 1977 Price List | Applefritter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As Wozniak was the only person who could answer most customer support questions about the computer, the company offered Apple I owners discounts and trade-ins for Apple IIs to persuade them to return their computers&lt;ref name=&quot;ah04&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah04/ | title=The Apple II, cont. | accessdate=February 27, 2011 | work=Apple II History}}&lt;/ref&gt; These recovered boards were then destroyed by Apple, contributing to their rarity today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.apple1notes.com/old_apple/Huston_Stories_files/A1%20Back%20Story.htm | title=The Huston brothers' Apple-1 Back Story | accessdate=June 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2013, at least 63 Apple I computers have been confirmed to exist.  Only six have been verified to be in working condition.

* An Apple I reportedly sold for $50,000 USD at auction in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ong|first=Josh|title=Auction of Apple's first computer expected to top $160k|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/10/11/11/auction_of_apples_first_computer_expected_to_top_160k.html|publisher=Apple Insider|accessdate=June 16, 2012|date=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2008, the website &quot;Vintage Computing and Gaming&quot; reported that Apple I owner Rick Conte was looking to sell his unit and was &quot;expecting a price in excess of $15,000 US.&quot;  The site later reported Conte had donated the unit to the Maine Personal Computer Museum in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple I For Sale|url=http://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/499|accessdate=September 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A unit was sold in September 2009 for $17,480 on eBay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Apple 1 Registry|url=http://www.willegal.net/appleii/apple1-originals.htm|work=Apple I Mimeo Project|accessdate=June 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A unit belonging to early Apple Computer engineers Dick and Cliff Huston was sold on March 23, 2010 for $42,766 on eBay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calande|first=John|title=Another very nice Apple-1 sold on ebay yesterday|url=http://apple1computer.blogspot.com/2010/03/another-very-nice-apple-1-sold-on-ebay.html|accessdate=June 16, 2012|date=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In November 2010, an Apple I sold for £133,250 ($210,000) at [[Christie's]] auction house in London. The high price was likely due to the rare documents and packaging offered in the sale in addition to the computer, including the original packaging (with the return label showing Steve Jobs' parents' address, the original Apple Computer Inc 'headquarters' being their garage), a personally typed and signed letter from Jobs (answering technical questions about the computer), and the original invoice showing 'Steven' as the salesman. The computer was brought to [[Polytechnic University of Turin]] where it was fixed and used to run the [[BASIC]] programming language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=BBC News|title=First Apple computer fetches £130,000 at auction|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11825954|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=June 16, 2012|date=November 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christie's Sale 7882 / Lot 65|url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=5370965&amp;sid=1d221fae-dbba-4746-9922-8ca3e066b4bf|publisher=Christie's|accessdate=June 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heater|first=Brian|title=$211,000 Apple-1 up and running, wants to know what this 'cloud' thing is all about|url=http://www.engadget.com/2011/05/10/211-000-apple-1-up-and-running-wants-to-know-what-this-cloud/|work=engadget|publisher=engadget.com|accessdate=June 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On June 15, 2012, a working Apple I was sold at auction by [[Sotheby's]] for a record $374,500, more than double the expected price.&lt;ref name=&quot;austin&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Austin|first=Scott|title=Original Apple 1 Computer Sells for $374,500 in Auction|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2012/06/15/original-apple-1-computer-sells-for-374500-in-auction/|accessdate=June 16, 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=June 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This unit is on display at the [[Nexon Computer Museum]] in [[Jeju City]], [[South Korea]].

* In October 2012, a non-working Apple I from the estate of former Apple Computer employee Joe Copson was put up for auction by Christie's, but found no bidder who was willing to pay the starting price of [[US$]]80,000 (£50,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=ABC News |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/technology/2012/10/rare-apple-1-computer-no-sale-at-christies-auction|title=Rare apple 1 computer no sale at christies auction|accessdate=October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Copson's board had previously been listed on eBay in December 2011, with a starting bid of $170,000 and failed to sell.

* On November 24, 2012, a working Apple I was sold at auction by Auction Team Breker for €400,000 (US$515,000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=the-saleroom.com|url=http://www.the-saleroom.com/en-gb/auction-catalogues/auction-team-breker/catalogue-id-2869018/lot-15886115|publisher=ATG Media|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*On May 25, 2013, a functioning 1976 model was sold for a record €516,000 (US$668,000) in [[Cologne]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/working-apple-1-sells-at-auction-for-record-breaking-671400/&lt;/ref&gt; Auction Team Breker said &quot;an unnamed Asian client&quot; bought the Apple I.

An old business transaction letter from Jobs also was included, as well as the original owner's manual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vintage Apple computer auctioned off for $668,000|url=http://news.yahoo.com/vintage-apple-computer-auctioned-off-668-000-153151365.html|publisher=Yahoo News|accessdate=May 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*On June 24, 2013, an Apple I was listed by Christie's as part of a special on-line only auction lot called, &quot;First Bytes: Iconic Technology From the Twentieth Century&quot;. Bidding ran through July 9, 2013.  The unit sold for $390,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First Apple Computer Sells for $390,000 in Christie’s Technology Auction|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/488167/20130709/apple-1-computer-sold-auction-online-technology.htm|publisher=International Business Times|accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple I auction fails to break 500K|url=http://macmint.com/apple-1-auction-fails-to-break-500k|publisher=Macmint|accessdate=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In November 2013, a working unit speculated to have been part of the original lot of 50 boards delivered to The Byte Shop was listed by Auction Team Breker for €180,000 ($242,820), but failed to sell during the auction.  Immediately following the close of bidding, a private collector purchased it for €246,000 ($330,000).  This board was marked '01-0046', matching the numbering placed on other units sold to The Byte Shop and included the original operation manuals, software cassettes, and shipping box autographed by Steve Wozniak.  The board also bears Wozniak's signature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple 1 Sold for $330k After Auction Close|url=http://www.cultofmac.com/254940/update-apple-1-does-sell-for-330k-after-auction-close|publisher=Cult of Mac|accessdate=March 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In October 2014, a working, early Apple 1 was sold at auction for $905,000 to the [[Henry Ford Museum]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]]. The sale included the keyboard, monitor, cassette decks, and a manual. The auction was run by [[Bonham's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple-1 computer sold at auction for $905,000|url=http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2014/10/22/apple-1-computer-sold-at-auction-for-905000|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=October 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*On December 13, 2014, a fully functioning, early Apple 1 was sold at auction for $365,000 by auction house [[Christie's]]. The sale included a keyboard, custom case, original manual, and a check labeled &quot;Purchased July 1976 from [[Steve Jobs]] in his parents' garage in Los Altos&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Computer sold by Steve Jobs out of his parents' garage raises $365,000 at auction|url=https://news.yahoo.com/computer-sold-steve-jobs-parents-115801772.html|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=December 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Serial numbers==
Both Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak have stated that Apple did not assign serial numbers to the Apple l.  Several boards have been found with numbered stickers affixed to them which appear to be inspection stickers from the PCB manufacturer/assembler.  A batch of boards is known to have numbers hand-written in black permanent marker on the back; these usually appear as &quot;01-00##&quot; and anecdotal evidence suggests they are inventory control numbers added by The Byte Shop to the batch Apple sold them.  These Byte Shop numbers have often erroneously been described as serial numbers by auction houses and in related press coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Apple 1 Registry|url=http://www.willegal.net/appleii/apple1-originals.htm|accessdate=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clones and replicas==
Several Apple I clones and replicas have been released in recent years.  These are all created by hobbyists and marketed to the hobbyist/collector community. Availability is usually limited to small runs in response to demand.
