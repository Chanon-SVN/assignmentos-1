'''Albinism''' in humans (from the [[Latin]] ''albus'', &quot;white&quot;; ''see [[wikt:albino|extended etymology]]'', also called '''achromia''', '''achromasia''', or '''achromatosis''') is a [[congenital disorder]] characterized by the complete or partial absence of [[Biological pigment|pigment]] in the skin, hair and eyes due to absence or defect of [[tyrosinase]], a copper-containing enzyme involved in the production of [[melanin]]. It is the opposite of [[melanism]].

Albinism results from inheritance of [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive gene]] [[alleles]] and is known to affect all [[vertebrate]]s, including [[humans]]. While an organism with complete absence of melanin is called an '''albino''' ({{IPAc-en|uk|æ|l|ˈ|b|iː|n|oʊ}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/albino &quot;Albino&quot;] Dictionary.com. Accessed May 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; or {{IPAc-en|us|æ|l|ˈ|b|aɪ|n|oʊ}})&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/pronunciation/british/albino &quot;Pronunciation of albino&quot;] Macmillan Dictionary. Accessed May 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; an organism with only a diminished amount of melanin is described as '''albinoid'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tietz&quot;&gt;Tietz, W. A Syndrome of Deaf-Mutism Associated with Albinism Showing Dominant Autosomal Inheritance. Department of Pediatrics, Southern California.&lt;/ref&gt;

Albinism is associated with a number of vision defects, such as [[photophobia]], [[nystagmus]] and [[amblyopia]]. Lack of skin pigmentation makes for more susceptibility to sunburn and skin cancers. In rare cases such as [[Chédiak–Higashi syndrome]], albinism may be associated with deficiencies in the transportation of melanin granules. This also affects essential granules present in immune cells leading to increased susceptibility to infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite PMID|18043242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Albinistic girl papua new guinea.jpg|thumb|left|287px|Girl with albinism from [[Papua New Guinea]]]]

In humans, there are two principal types of albinism: [[Oculocutaneous albinism|oculocutaneous]], affecting the eyes, skin and hair, and [[Ocular albinism|ocular]] affecting the eyes only.

Most people with oculocutaneous albinism appear white or very pale, as the melanin pigments responsible for brown, black, and some yellow colorations are not present. Ocular albinism results in light blue eyes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolf|first1=Sebastian|first2=2005|title=Ocular Fundus: From Findings to Diagnosis|publisher=Thieme Medical Publishers|isbn=978-3131393715|page=96|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=B8EvfqZD2xwC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=Ocular+albinism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mS9VVKSOIYjxaLj9gYAP&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Ocular%20albinism&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may require genetic testing to diagnose.

Because individuals with albinism have skin that entirely lacks the dark pigment melanin, which helps protect the skin from the sun's [[ultraviolet]] [[radiation]], their skin can [[sunburn|burn]] more easily from overexposure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Chen, Harold |title=Atlas of genetic diagnosis and counseling |publisher=Humana Press |location=Totowa, NJ |year=2006 |pages=37–40 |isbn=1-58829-681-4 |oclc= |doi= |url=http://books.google.com/?id=2VcdAXJ_dZkC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=Albinism&amp;q=Albinism|accessdate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human eye normally produces enough pigment to color the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] blue, green or brown and lend opacity to the eye. In photographs, those with albinism are more likely to demonstrate &quot;red eye,&quot; due to the red of [[retina]] being visible through the iris. Lack of pigment in the eyes also results in problems with vision, both related and unrelated to [[photosensitivity]].

Those afflicted with albinism are generally as healthy as the rest of the population (but see related disorders below), with growth and development occurring as normal, and albinism by itself does not cause mortality,&lt;ref name=&quot;eMedicine1&quot; /&gt; although the lack of pigment blocking [[ultraviolet]] [[radiation]] increases the risk of melanomas (skins cancers) and other problems.

===Visual problems===
[[Image:Mali Salif Keita2 400.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Mali]]an albino singer [[Salif Keita]] from [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] culture.]]
Development of the optical system is highly dependent on the presence of melanin, and the reduction or absence of this pigment in sufferers of albinism may lead to:
* Misrouting of the retinogeniculate projections, resulting in abnormal [[decussation]] (crossing) of optic nerve fibres&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis&quot;/&gt;
* [[Photophobia]] and decreased [[visual acuity]] due to light scattering within the eye ([[ocular straylight]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kruijt B et al. &quot;Ocular straylight in albinism&quot;. ''Optom Vis Sc'' 2011;88:E585-E592&lt;/ref&gt;
* Reduced visual acuity due to [[Macular hypoplasia|foveal hypoplasia]] and possibly light-induced [[retina]]l damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis&quot;/&gt;

Eye conditions common in albinism include:
* [[Nystagmus]], irregular rapid movement of the eyes back and forth, or in circular motion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis&quot;/&gt;
* [[Amblyopia]], decrease in acuity of one or both eyes due to poor transmission to the brain, often due to other conditions such as [[strabismus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis&quot;/&gt;
* [[Optic nerve hypoplasia]], underdevelopment of the optic nerve.

Some of the visual problems associated with albinism arise from a poorly developed [[retinal pigment epithelium]] (RPE) due to the lack of melanin.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} This degenerate RPE causes foveal hypoplasia (a failure in the development of normal [[Fovea centralis|fovea]]e), which results in eccentric fixation and lower visual acuity, and often a minor level of strabismus.

The [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a [[sphincter]] formed from pigmented tissue that contracts when the eye is exposed to bright light, to protect the [[retina]] by limiting the amount of light passing through the pupil. In low light conditions, the iris relaxes to allow more light to enter the eye. In albinistic subjects, the iris does not have enough pigment to block the light, thus the decrease in pupil diameter is only partially successful in reducing the amount of light entering the eye.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Additionally, the improper development of the RPE, which in normal eyes absorbs most of the reflected sunlight, further increases glare due to light scattering within the eye.&lt;ref name=&quot;Optometry_Albinism&quot;&gt;[http://www.revoptom.com/HANDBOOK/SECT58a.HTM &quot;Albinism—Review of Optometry Online&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting sensitivity (photophobia) generally leads to discomfort in bright light, but this can be reduced by the use of sunglasses and/or brimmed hats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Facts_Albinism&quot;&gt;[http://albinism.med.umn.edu/facts.htm &quot;Facts about Albinism&quot;], by Dr. Richard King et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==
[[Oculocutaneous albinism]] is generally the result of the [[biological inheritance]] of [[dominance relationship|genetically recessive]] [[allele]]s ([[gene]]s) passed from both parents of an individual for example [[OCA1]] and [[OCA2]].  A mutation in the human TRP-1 gene may result in the deregulation of melanocyte tyrosinase enzymes, a change that is hypothesized to promote brown versus black melanin synthesis, resulting in a third oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) genotype, ″OCA3.″ &lt;ref&gt;Boissy, Raymond E., et al. “Mutation in and Lack of Expression of Tyrosinase-Related Protein-1 (TRP-1) in Melanocytes from an Individual with Brown Oculotaneous Albinism: A New Subtype of Albinism Classified as ‘OCA3’.” The American Journal of Human Genetics Jun. 1996: 1145-56. Web. 10 Sep. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some rare forms are inherited from only one parent. There are other [[genetic mutation]]s which are proven to be associated with albinism. All alterations, however, lead to changes in melanin production in the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;eMedicine1&quot;&gt;[http://www.emedicine.com/derm/topic12.htm &quot;Albinism&quot;], by Dr. Raymond E. Boissy, Dr. James J. Nordlund, et al., at [[eMedicine]], 22 August 2005. Retrieved 31 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OMIM1&quot;&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?CMD=search&amp;DB=omim&amp;term=albinism Online ''Mendelian Inheritance in Man''], at [[Johns Hopkins University]] (see also [[Mendelian Inheritance in Man]] for more information about this source).&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of these are associated with increased risk of skin cancer ([[List of cutaneous conditions associated with increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer|see list of such genetic variations]]).

The chance of offspring with albinism resulting from the pairing of an organism with albinism and one without albinism is low. However, because organisms (including humans) can be carriers of genes for albinism without exhibiting any traits, albinistic offspring can be produced by two non-albinistic parents. Albinism usually occurs with equal frequency in both sexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;eMedicine1&quot; /&gt; An exception to this is ocular albinism, which it is passed on to offspring through X-linked inheritance. Thus, ocular albinism occurs more frequently in males as they have a single X and Y chromosome, unlike females, whose genetics are characterized by two X&amp;nbsp;chromosomes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sex-linked_recessive&quot;&gt;[http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002051.htm &quot;Sex-linked recessive&quot;], by Chad Haldeman-Englert, MD, Division of Human Genetics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two different forms of albinism: a partial lack of the melanin is known as hypomelanism, or hypomelanosis, and the total absence of melanin is known as [[amelanism]] or amelanosis.

==Enzyme==
The enzyme defect responsible for albinism is tyrosine 3-monooxegenase (tyrosinase), which synthesizes melanin from the amino acid [[tyrosine]].

==Diagnosis==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2007}}
[[Genetic testing]] can confirm albinism and what variety it is, but offers no medical benefits except in the cases of non-OCA disorders (see below) that cause albinism ''along with'' other medical problems which may be treatable. There is no 'cure' for Albinism.   The ''symptoms'' of albinism can be assisted by various methods detailed below.

==Treatment==
For the most part, treatment of the eye conditions consists of visual rehabilitation. Surgery is possible on the extra-ocular muscles to decrease [[strabismus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Atlas of Genetic Diagnosis&quot;/&gt; Nystagmus-damping surgery can also be performed, to reduce the &quot;shaking&quot; of the eyes back and forth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Surgical management of nystagmus&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lee J |title=Surgical management of nystagmus |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=95 |issue=5 |pages=238–41 |date=May 2002 |pmid=11983764 |pmc=1279676 |doi=10.1258/jrsm.95.5.238}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effectiveness of all these procedures varies greatly and depends on individual circumstances.

[[Glasses]] and other vision aids, [[large-print]] materials as well as bright but angled reading lights, can help individuals with albinism, even though their vision cannot be corrected completely. Some people with albinism do well using [[bifocals]] (with a strong reading lens), prescription reading glasses, and/or hand-held devices such as [[Magnifying glass|magnifiers]] or [[monocular]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Facts_Albinism&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://albinism.med.umn.edu/facts.htm |title=Facts about Albinism |first=Richard |last=King}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Contact lenses]] may be colored to block light transmission through the &lt;!--commenting out unexplained term for now: aniridic--&gt;iris. But in the case of nystagmus this is not possible, due to the irritation that is caused by the movement of the eyes. Some use [[bioptics (device)|bioptics]], glasses which have small telescopes mounted on, in, or behind their regular lenses, so that they can look through either the regular lens or the telescope. Newer designs of bioptics use smaller light-weight lenses. Some US states allow the use of bioptic telescopes for driving motor vehicles. (See also [[National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation|NOAH]] bulletin &quot;Low Vision Aids&quot;.)

It is important to remember there is no cure for Albinism which is not a sickness or disease. People with Albinism need to take care not to sun-burn and should have regular healthy skin checks by a dermatologist.

To support those with albinism, and their families, [[National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation]] can provide a network of resources and information.

===Epidemiology===
Albinism affects people of all ethnic backgrounds; its frequency worldwide is estimated to be approximately one in 17,000. Prevalence of the different forms of albinism varies considerably by population, and is highest overall in people of sub-Saharan African descent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oculocutaneous albinism&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gronskov K, Ek J, Brondum-Nielsen K |title=Oculocutaneous albinism |journal=Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases |date=2 November 2007 |doi=10.1186/1750-1172-2-43 |pmc=2211462 |pmid=17980020 |volume=2 |pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Persecution of people with albinism|Albinism in popular culture}}
In physical terms, humans with albinism commonly have visual problems and need sun protection. They often face social and cultural challenges (even threats), as the condition is often a source of ridicule, discrimination, or even fear and violence. Many cultures around the world have developed beliefs regarding people with albinism.

In African countries such as [[Tanzania]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7518049.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Living in fear: Tanzania's albinos |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-07-21 |accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Burundi]],&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11614957 | work=BBC News | title=Burundi albino boy 'dismembered' | date=24 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8057956.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Burundian albino murders denied |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-05-19 |accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been an unprecedented rise in [[witchcraft]]-related killings of people with albinism in recent years, because their body parts are used in potions sold by [[witchdoctor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visuramagazine.com/franck-vogel-zeru-zeru Reportage &quot;Zeru, Zeru: Being albino in Tanzanie&quot;] by [[Franck Vogel]] inside Visura Magazine&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous authenticated incidents have occurred in Africa during the 21st Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7726743.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Man 'tried to sell' albino wife |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-11-13 |accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7527729.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Tanzania albinos targeted again |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-07-27 |accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ntetema |first=Vicky |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7523796.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; In hiding for exposing Tanzania witchdoctors |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-07-24 |accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7730193.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Mothers hacked in albino attacks |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-11-14 |accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in Tanzania, in September 2009, three men were convicted of killing a 14-year-old albino boy and severing his legs in order to sell them for witchcraft purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8270446.stm |title=Death for Tanzania albino killers |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-09-23 |accessdate=27 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Again in Tanzania and Burundi in 2010, the murder and dismemberment of a kidnapped albino child was reported from the courts,&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt; as part of a continuing problem.  [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] estimates that in Tanzania a complete set of albino body parts is worth $75,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/01/130125-albino-albinism-tanzania-witch-doctors/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another harmful and false belief is that sex with an albinistic woman will cure a man of [[HIV]]. This has led, for example in [[Zimbabwe]], to rapes (and subsequent HIV infection).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/interna.asp?idnews=14122|title=RIGHTS-ZIMBABWE: The Last Minority Group to Find a Voice|last=Machipisa|first=Lewis |work=Inter Press Service News Agency|publisher=IPS-Inter Press Service|accessdate=30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain ethnic groups and populations in isolated areas exhibit heightened susceptibility to albinism, presumably due to genetic factors. These include notably the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[Kuna (people)|Kuna]], [[Zuni people|Zuni]] and [[Hopi]] nations (respectively of [[Panama]], [[New Mexico]] and [[Arizona]]); [[Japan]], in which one particular form of albinism is unusually common; and [[Ukerewe Island]], the population of which shows a very high incidence of albinism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southern-africas-children.org.uk/ukerewe-albino.html|title=Ukerewe Albino Society|last=Anon|year=2009|work=southern-africas-children.org.uk/|publisher=Southern Africas Children|accessdate=21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous people with albinism include historical figures such as [[Oxford University|Oxford]] don [[William Archibald Spooner]]; actor-comedian [[Victor Varnado]]; musicians such as [[Johnny Winter|Johnny]] and [[Edgar Winter]], [[Salif Keita]], [[Yellowman|Winston &quot;Yellowman&quot; Foster]], [[Brother Ali]], [[Sivuca]], [[Piano Red|Willie &quot;Piano Red&quot; Perryman]]; and fashion models [[Connie Chiu]] and [[Shaun Ross (model)|Shaun Ross]].  [[Emperor Seinei]] of Japan is thought to have been an albino because he was said to have been born with white hair.&lt;!--

==Evolutionary theories==

It is suggested that the early hominin evolved in East Africa around 3 million years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;royalsocietypublishing.org&quot;&gt;Greaves M. 2014. Was skin cancer a selective force for black pigmentation in early hominin evolution?. Royal Society Publishing [Internet]. [cited 2014 Oct 18]. Available from: http://royalsocietypublishing.org/content/281/1781/20132955&lt;/ref&gt; The dramatic phenotypic change from primate to early hominin is hypothesized to have involved the extreme loss of body hair – except for areas most exposed to UV radiation, such as the head – to allow for more efficient thermoregulation in the early hunter-gatherers. The skin that would have been exposed upon general body hair loss in these early hominins would have most likely been non-pigmented, reflecting the pale skin underlying the hair of our chimpanzee relatives. A positive advantage would have been conferred to early hominids inhabiting the African continent that were capable of producing darker skin – those who first expressed the eumelanin-producing MC1R allele – which protected them from harmful epithelium-damaging ultraviolet rays. Over time, the advantage conferred to those with darker skin may have led to the prevalence of darker skin on the continent. The positive advantage, however, would have had to be strong enough so as to produce a significantly higher reproductive fitness in those who produced more melanin. The cause of a selective pressure strong enough to cause this shift is an area of much debate. Some hypotheses include the existence of significantly lower reproductive fitness in people with less melanin due to lethal skin cancer, lethal kidney disease due excess vitamin D formation in the skin of people with less melanin, or simply natural selection due to mate preference and sexual selection.&lt;ref name=&quot;royalsocietypublishing.org&quot;/&gt;

When comparing the prevalence of albinism in Africa to its prevalence in other parts of the world, such as Europe and the United States, the potential evolutionary effects of skin cancer as a selective force due to its effect on these populations may not be insignificant. The prevalence of albinism in some ethnic groups in sub-Saharan Africa is around 1 in 5,000, while in Europe and the US it is 1 in 20,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;royalsocietypublishing.org&quot;/&gt; It would follow, then, that there would be stronger selective forces acting on albino populations in Africa than on albino populations in Europe and the US. Rates as high as 1 in 1,000 have been reported for some populations in Zimbabwe and other parts of Southern Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;biomedcentral.com&quot;&gt;Hong ES, Zeeb H, Repacholi MH. 2006. Albinism in Africa as a public health issue. BioMed Central [Internet]. [cited 2014 Oct 17] 6:212. Available from: http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/6/212/&lt;/ref&gt; In two separate studies in Nigeria, people suffering from albinism were found to be of reproductively significant age more often than not. One study found that 89% of people diagnosed with albinism are between 0 and 30 years of age, while the other found that 77% of albinos were under the age of 20.&lt;ref name=&quot;biomedcentral.com&quot;/&gt;

==Other animals==

Albinism is also quite common in animals other than humans including both vertebrates and invertebrates. Many animals with albinism lack their protective [[camouflage]] and are thus unable to conceal themselves from their predators or prey; the survival rate of animals with albinism in the wild can be quite low.&lt;ref name=&quot;survival1&quot;&gt;Ilo Hiler, Albinos. ''Young Naturalist''. The Louise Lindsey Merrick Texas Environment Series, No. 6, pp. 28–31. Texas A&amp;M University Press, College Station (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;survival2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1439-0426.2000.00147.x |first1=ByS |last1=Dobosz |first2=K. |last2=Kohlmann |first3=K. |last3=Goryczko |first4=H. |last4=Kuzminski |date=July 2008 |title=Growth and vitality in yellow forms of rainbow trout |journal=Journal of Applied Ichthyology |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=117–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the novelty of albino animals has occasionally led to their protection by groups such as the [[Albino Squirrel Preservation Society]].

In &quot;partial albinism&quot;, there can be a single patch or patches of skin that lack melanin. Especially in [[albinism in birds|albinistic birds]] and reptiles, ruddy and yellow hues or other colors may be present on the entire body or in patches (as is common among pigeons), because of the presence of other pigments unaffected by albinism such as [[porphyrin]]s, [[pteridine]]s and psittacins, as well as [[carotenoid]] pigments derived from the diet.

Intentionally bred albinistic strains of some animal species are commonly used as [[model organism]]s in biomedical study and experimentation, although some researchers have argued that they are not always the best choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Creel D |title=Inappropriate use of albino animals as models in research |journal=Pharmacology, Biochemistry, and Behavior |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=969–7 |date=June 1980 |pmid=7403210 |doi=10.1016/0091-3057(80)90461-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[BALB/c]] mouse and [[Wistar rat|Wistar]] and [[Sprague Dawley rat]] strains, while albino rabbits were historically used for [[Draize test|Draize toxicity testing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Draize&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Draize, J.H., Woodard, G. and Calvery, H.O. | year = 1944 | title = Methods for the study of irritation and toxicity of substances applied topically to the skin and mucous membranes | url =  | journal = J. Pharmacol. and Exp. Therapeutics. | volume = 82 | issue =  | pages = 377–390 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''yellow'' mutation in [[Drosophila|fruit flies]] is their version of albinism.

The incidence of albinism can be artificially increased in fish by exposing the eggs to [[heavy metals]] (arsenic, cadmium, copper, mercury, selenium, zinc).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1590/S1679-62252005000100009 |title=An albino armored catfish Schizolecis guntheri (Siluriformes: Loricariidae) from an Atlantic Forest coastal basin |year=2005 |last1=Brito |first1=Marcelo F.

The eyes of an albino animal appear red because the colour of the red blood cells in the underlying retinal blood vessels shows through where there is no pigment to obscure it.

Famous albino animals include [[Migaloo]], a [[humpback whale]] off the coast of Australia; [[Pinky (dolphin)|Pinky]], a [[bottlenose dolphin]] living in and around in [[Calcasieu Lake]], Louisiana; [[Snowflake (albino gorilla)|Snowflake]], a [[Barcelona Zoo]] [[gorilla]]; [[Snowflake (penguin)|Snowflake]], a [[Bristol Zoo]] [[penguin]]; and [[Mahpiya Ska]] ([[Sioux]] for &quot;White Cloud&quot;), a [[American Bison|buffalo]] in [[Jamestown, North Dakota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,287938,00.html |title=Rare Pink Dolphin Seen in Louisiana Lake – Science News &amp;#124; Science &amp; Technology &amp;#124; Technology News |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=2007-07-03 |accessdate=27 February 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100224154728/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,287938,00.html| archivedate= 24 February 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inspiration for [[Herman Melville]]'s novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' was a [[sperm whale]] known as [[Mocha Dick]].

==Related pigment disorders==
In some animals, albinism-like conditions may affect other pigments or pigment-production mechanisms:
* &quot;Whiteface,&quot; a condition that affects some parrot species, is caused by a lack of psittacins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hesford&quot;&gt;[http://www.birdhobbyist.com/parrotcolour/parblu04.html &quot;The Parblue Puzzle: Part 4—Common Parblue Varieties: The Cockatiel &amp;#91;''Nymphicus hollandicus''&amp;#93;&quot;] by Clive Hesford, ''The Genetics of Colour in the Budgerigar and Other Parrots'', January 1998&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Albino Gator.jpg|thumb|A leucistic alligator at the Audubon Aquarium of the Americas, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA]]
* [[Axanthism]] is a condition common in reptiles and amphibians, in which [[xanthophore#Xanthophores and erythrophores|xanthophore]] [[metabolism]] is affected rather than [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of melanin, resulting in reduction or absence of red and yellow pteridine pigments.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABPC&quot;&gt;[http://www.livingunderworld.org/biology/caudata/ &quot;Amphibian Biology &amp; Physiology: ''Caudata''&quot;] at ''Amphibian Information Resource: An Educational Web Project About Amphibian Species''; sourced December 2006, actual authoring/publication date unspecified.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Leucism]] differs from albinism in that the melanin is, at least, partially absent but the eyes retain their usual color. Some leucistic animals are white or pale because of [[chromatophore]] (pigment cell) defects, and do not lack melanin.
* [[Melanism]] is the direct opposite of albinism. An unusually high level of melanin pigmentation (and sometimes absence of other types of pigment in species that have more than one) results in an appearance darker than non-melanistic specimens from the same genepool.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feinstein&quot;&gt;[http://www.birdersworld.com/brd/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=676 &quot;Feather Colors: What We See&quot;] by Dr. Julie Feinstein of the American Museum of Natural History (NY), in ''Birder's World Magazine'' online archive; sourced December 2006, actual authoring/publication date unspecified.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants that are pale due to a mutation that eliminates [[chlorophyll]] production are sometimes termed albinos, whereas plants that are pale from being in the dark are called [[etiolation|etiolated]]. [[Albino redwood]]s are rare examples that may grow to substantial size as [[parasite]]s.
