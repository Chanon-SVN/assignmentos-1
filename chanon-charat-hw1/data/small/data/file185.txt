'''Actinopterygii''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|k|t|ɨ|n|ˌ|ɒ|p|t|ə|ˈ|r|ɪ|dʒ|i|.|aɪ}}, or the '''ray-finned fishes''', constitute a [[Class (biology)|class]] or subclass of the [[Osteichthyes|bony fishes]]. 

The ray-finned [[fish]]es are so called because they possess [[lepidotrichia]] or &quot;fin rays&quot;, their fins being webs of skin supported by bony or horny spines (&quot;rays&quot;), as opposed to the fleshy, lobed fins that characterize the class [[Sarcopterygii]] which also, however, possess lepidotrichia. These actinopterygian fin rays attach directly to the proximal or basal skeletal elements, the radials, which represent the link or connection between these fins and the internal skeleton (e.g., pelvic and pectoral girdles). 

In terms of numbers, actinopterygians are the dominant class of [[vertebrate]]s, comprising nearly 99% of the over 30,000 species of fish.&lt;ref&gt;(Davis, Brian 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; They are ubiquitous throughout [[freshwater]] and [[ocean|marine]] environments from the deep sea to the highest mountain streams. Extant species can range in size from ''[[Paedocypris]]'', at {{convert|8|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, to the massive [[ocean sunfish]], at {{convert|2300|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}}, and the long-bodied [[oarfish]], at {{convert|11|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.

==Fossil record==
[[File:Evolution of ray-finned fish.png|thumb|500px|right]]
{{see also|Evolution of fish}}

The earliest known fossil actinopterygiian is ''[[Andreolepis hedei]]'', dating back 420 million years ([[Late Silurian]]). Remains have been found in [[Russia]], [[Sweden]], and [[Estonia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://paleodb.org/cgi-bin/bridge.pl?action=checkTaxonInfo&amp;taxon_no=34968&amp;is_real_user=1 Palaeobase]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Traditionally actinopterygians have been divided into the subclasses '''[[Chondrostei]]''' and '''[[Neopterygii]]'''. [[Neopterygii]], in turn, have been divided into the infraclasses '''[[Holostei]]''' and '''[[Teleostei]]'''. Some morphological evidence suggests the Neopterygii is [[paraphyletic]]; however, recent work, based on taxon orders, is arranged in what has been suggested to represent the evolutionary sequence down to the level of order, based primarily on the long history of morphological studies. This classification, like any other [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] based on [[phylogenetic]] research, has been in a state of flux. Recent morphological and molecular data have shown several of these ordinal and higher-level groupings represent [[evolutionary grade]]s rather than [[clade]]s. Examples of demonstrably [[paraphyletic]] groups include the [[Paracanthopterygii]], [[Scorpaeniformes]], and [[Perciformes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = G. D. Johnson and E. O. Wiley | year = 2006 | title = Tree of Life: Percomorpha | url = http://www.tolweb.org/Percomorpha/52146 |date=March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of the nonteleostean actinopterygians shows that polypterids (bichirs and ropefish) are the sister lineage of all other actinopterygians (Actinopteri), Acipenseriformes (sturgeons and paddlefishes) are the sister lineage of Neopterygii, and  Holostei (bowfin and gars) are the sister lineage of teleosts. The [[Elopomorpha]] (eels and tarpons) appears to be the most basic teleosts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/109/34/13698.full Resolution of ray-finned fish phylogeny and timing of diversification]&lt;/ref&gt;

| valign=top | [[Chondrostei]] ''(cartilage bone)'' are primarily [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] fish showing some [[ossification]]. There are 52 species divided among two orders, the [[Acipenseriformes]] ([[sturgeon]]s ''(pictured)'' and [[paddlefish]]es) and the [[Polypteriformes]] ([[reedfish]]es and [[bichir]]s). It is thought that the ancestors of the chondrosteans were bony fish but that this characteristic was lost in later [[evolution]]ary development, resulting in a lightening of the frame. Elderly chondrosteans show beginnings of ossification of the skeleton which suggests that this process is delayed rather than lost in these fish.&lt;ref name=&quot;chondro&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.palaeos.com/Vertebrates/Units/090Teleostomi/090.300.html |title =Chondrosteans: Sturgeon Relatives |publisher=paleos.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; This group has at times been classified with the [[shark]]s: the similarities are obvious, not only do the chondrosteans mostly lack bone, the structure of the jaw is more akin to that of sharks than other bony fish, and both lack [[Scale (zoology)|scales]] (excluding the Polypteriforms). Additional shared features include [[spiracle]]s and, in sturgeons, a heterocercal tail (the [[vertebra]]e extend into the larger lobe of the [[caudal fin]]). However the fossil record suggests that these fish have more in common with the [[Teleostei]] than their external appearance might suggest.&lt;ref name=&quot;chondro&quot;/&gt; Chondrostei is [[paraphyly|paraphyletic]] meaning that this subclass does not contain all the descendants of their common ancestor; reclassification of the Chondrostei is therefore not out of the question.

| [[Neopterygii]] ''(new fins)'' appeared somewhere in the Late [[Permian]], before the time of the dinosaurs. There are only few changes during their evolution from the earlier actinopterygians. They are a very successful group of fishes, because they can move more rapidly than their ancestors. Their scales and skeletons began to lighten during their evolution, and their jaws became more powerful and efficient. While [[electroreception]] and the [[ampullae of Lorenzini]] is present in all other groups of fish, with the exception of [[hagfish]], Neopterygii has lost this sense, though it later re-evolved within [[Gymnotiformes]] and [[catfish]]es, who possess nonhomologous teleost ampullae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Theodore Holmes Bullock|author2=Carl D.
