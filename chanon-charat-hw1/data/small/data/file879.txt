'''Andronicus of [[Cyrrhus]]''' ({{lang-el|Ἀνδρόνικος Κυρρήστου}}) or '''Andronicus Cyrrhestes''',son of Hermias, was a [[Ancient Macedonia|Macedonian]] [[astronomer]] who flourished about 100 BC.

==Life==
He built a ''[[horologion]]'' at [[Athens]], the so-called [[Tower of the Winds]], a considerable portion of which still exists. It is octagonal, with figures carved on each side, representing the eight principal winds. In antiquity a bronze figure of [[Triton (god)|Triton]] on the summit, with a rod in his hand, turned round by the wind, pointed to the quarter from which it blew. From this model is derived the custom of placing weathercocks on steeples.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
