'''Bertrand Andrieu''' (4 November 1761 &amp;ndash; 10 December 1822) was a  French engraver of medals from [[Bordeaux]]. In [[France]] he was considered as the restorer of the art, which had declined after the time of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], and during the last twenty years of his life the French government commissioned him to undertake several works. Many of his medals are featured in the ''Medallic History of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]''.
