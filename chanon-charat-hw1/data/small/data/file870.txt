'''Andocides''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|d|oʊ|ˈ|s|aɪ|d|iː|z}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoplease.com/encyclopedia/people/andocides.html &quot;Andocides&quot;]. [[Columbia Encyclopedia|''The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia'']], 6th ed., Columbia University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc-gre|Ἀνδοκίδης}}, ''Andokides''; c. 440 – c. 390 BC) was a [[logographer (legal)|logographer]] (speech writer) in Ancient Greece.  He was one of the ten [[Attic orators]] included in the &quot;Alexandrian Canon&quot; compiled by [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] and [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] in the third century BC.

==Life==
He was implicated during the [[Peloponnesian War]] in the mutilation of the [[Herms]] on the eve of the departure of the [[Sicilian expedition|Athenian expedition]] against [[Sicily]] in 415 BC. Although he saved his life by turning informer, he was condemned to partial loss of civil rights and forced to leave Athens.  He engaged in commercial pursuits, and returned to [[Classical Athens|Athens]] under the general amnesty that followed the restoration of the democracy (403 BC), and filled some important offices.  In 391 BC he was one of the ambassadors sent to [[Sparta]] to discuss peace terms, but the negotiations failed. [[oligarchy|Oligarch]]ical in his sympathies, he offended his own party and was distrusted by the democrats. Andocides was no professional orator; his style is simple and lively, natural but inartistic.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
