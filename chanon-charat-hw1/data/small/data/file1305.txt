'''Antidepressants''' are drugs used for the treatment of [[major depressive disorder]] and other conditions, including [[dysthymia]], [[anxiety disorder]]s, [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], [[eating disorder]]s, [[chronic pain]], [[neuropathic pain]] and, in some cases, [[dysmenorrhoea]], snoring, [[migraine]]s, [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[substance abuse]] and [[sleep disorder]]s. They can be used alone or in combination with other medications.

The most important classes of antidepressants are the [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs), [[serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors]] (SNRIs), [[tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCAs) and [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] (MAOIs). Other drugs used or proposed for the treatment of depression include [[buprenorphine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bodkin JA, Zornberg GL, Lukas SE, Cole JO | title = Buprenorphine Treatment of Refractory Depression | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 49–57 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7714228 | doi = 10.1097/00004714-199502000-00008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; low-dose [[antipsychotics]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12755661&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wheeler Vega JA, Mortimer AM, Tyson PJ | title = Conventional antipsychotic prescription in unipolar depression, I: an audit and recommendations for practice | journal = J Clin Psychiatry | volume = 64 | issue = 5 | pages = 568–74 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12755661 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v64n0512 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hypericum perforatum|St John's wort]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18843608&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Linde K, Berner MM, Kriston L | title = St John's wort for major depression | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = | issue = 4 | pages = CD000448 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18843608 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD000448.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical uses==

For depression, the [[Hamilton Depression Rating Scale]] (HAM-D) is often used to measure the severity of depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14399272&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hamilton M | title = A rating scale for depression | journal = J. Neurol. Neurosurg. Psychiatr. | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 56–62 | year = 1960 | pmid = 14399272 | pmc = 495331 | doi = 10.1136/jnnp.23.1.56 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum score for the 17-item HAM-D questionnaire is 52; the higher the score, the more severe the depression.

====Clinical guidelines====

The UK [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) 2004 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be used for the initial treatment of mild depression, because the risk-benefit ratio is poor. The guidelines recommend that antidepressants treatment in combination with psychosocial interventions should be considered for:

:* People with a past history of moderate or severe depression
:* Those with mild depression that has been present for a long period
:* As a second line treatment for mild depression that persists after other interventions
:* As a first line treatment for moderate or severe depression.

The guidelines further note that antidepressant treatment should be continued for at least 6 months to reduce the risk of relapse, and that SSRIs are better tolerated than tricyclic antidepressants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/CG23 |accessdate=20 March 2013 |title=Depression |publisher=National Institute for Health and Care Excellence |date=December 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081115042517/http://www.nice.org.uk/Guidance/CG23 |archivedate=15 November 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American Psychiatric Association]] treatment guidelines recommend that initial treatment should be individually tailored based on factors including severity of symptoms, co-existing disorders, prior treatment experience, and patient preference.  Options may include pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) or light therapy.  Antidepressant medication is recommended as an initial treatment choice in people with mild, moderate, or severe major depression, and should be given to all patients with severe depression unless ECT is planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psychiatryonline.org/content.aspx?bookID=28&amp;sectionID=1667485#654260 |title=PsychiatryOnline &amp;#124; APA Practice Guidelines &amp;#124; Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Patients With Major Depressive Disorder, Third Edition |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Systematic Reviews====

Conflicting results have arisen from studies analyzing the efficacy of antidepressants by comparisons to placebo in people with acute mild to moderate depression. Stronger evidence supports the usefulness of antidepressants in the treatment of depression that is chronic ([[dysthymia]]) or severe.

Researchers Irving Kirsch and Thomas Moore have contested the pharmacological activity of antidepressants in the relief of depression, and state that the evidence is most consistent a role as active [[placebo]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;administration2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=The emperor's new drugs: An analysis of antidepressant medication data submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration  |author = Kirsch I, Moore TJ, Scoboria A, Nicholls SS | journal = Prevention &amp; Treatment | year = 2002 | volume = 5 | doi = 10.1037/1522-3736.5.1.523a }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their study consisted of a meta analysis incorporating data from both published studies and unpublished data obtained from the FDA via a [[Freedom of Information Act]] request.  Overall, antidepressant pills worked 18% better than placebos, a statistically significant difference, but not one that is clinically significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/drugs/2002-07-08-antidepressants.htm |title=Study: Antidepressant barely better than placebo |newspaper=USA Today |date=7 July 2002 |accessdate=6 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later publication, Kirsch concluded that the overall effect of new-generation antidepressant medication is below recommended criteria for clinical significance.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18303940&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kirsch I, Deacon BJ, Huedo-Medina TB, Scoboria A, Moore TJ, Johnson BT | title = Initial Severity and Antidepressant Benefits: A Meta-Analysis of Data Submitted to the Food and Drug Administration | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = e45 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18303940 | pmc = 2253608 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0050045 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study focusing on paroxetine (Paxil) and imipramine found that antidepressant drugs were only slightly better than placebo in cases of mild or moderate depression they surveyed but offered &quot;substantial&quot; benefit in those with severe depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fournier JC, DeRubeis RJ, Hollon SD, et al. 47–53&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fournier JC, DeRubeis RJ, Hollon SD, et al. |title=Antidepressant drug effects and depression severity: a patient-level meta-analysis |journal=JAMA |volume=303 |issue=1 |pages=47–53 |date=January 2010  |pmid=20051569 |pmc=3712503 |doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1943 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the U.S. FDA published a systematic review of all antidepressant maintenance trials submitted to the agency between 1985 and 2012.  The authors concluded that maintenance treatment reduced the risk of relapse by 52% compared to placebo, and that this effect was primarily due to recurrent depression in the placebo group rather than a drug withdrawal effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fournier JC, DeRubeis RJ, Hollon SD, et al. 47–53&quot;/&gt;

A review commissioned by the [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] concluded that there is strong evidence that SSRIs have greater efficacy than placebo on achieving a 50% reduction in depression scores in moderate and severe major depression, and that there is some evidence for a similar effect in mild depression. The treatment guidelines developed in conjunction with this review suggest that antidepressants should be considered in patients with moderate to severe depression and those with mild depression that is persistent or resistant to other treatment modalities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Depression in Adults update&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Depression in Adults (update) |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/Depression_Update_FULL_GUIDELINE.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=www.nice.org.uk |work=National Collaborating Centre for Mental Health Commissioned by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence |accessdate=20 November 2013 |pages=282–292|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130612122946/http://www.nice.org.uk:80/nicemedia/pdf/Depression_Update_FULL_GUIDELINE.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cochrane Collaboration]] recently performed a systematic review of clinical trials of the generic antidepressant [[amitriptyline]]. The study concluded that in spite of moderate evidence for publication bias, there is strong evidence that the efficacy of amitriptyline is superior to placebo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Leucht C, Huhn M, Leucht S | title = Amitriptyline versus placebo for major depressive disorder | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 12 | pages = CD009138 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23235671 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD009138.pub2 | editor1-last = Leucht | editor1-first = C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' (''JAMA'') demonstrated that the magnitude of the placebo effect in clinical trials of depression have been growing over time, while the effect size of tested drugs has remained relatively constant. The authors suggest that one possible explanation for the growing placebo effect in clinical trials is the inclusion of larger number of participants with shorter term, mild, or spontaneously remitting depression as a result of decreasing stigma associated with antidepressant use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Walsh BT, Seidman SN, Sysko R, Gould M | title = Placebo Response in Studies of Major Depression: Variable, Substantial, and Growing | journal = JAMA | volume = 287 | issue = 14 | pages = 1840–7 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11939870 | doi = 10.1001/jama.287.14.1840 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 review concluded that antidepressant studies that failed to support efficacy claims were dramatically less likely to be published than those that did support favorable efficacy claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lee K, Bacchetti P, Sim I | title = Publication of Clinical Trials Supporting Successful New Drug Applications: A Literature Analysis | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = e191 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18816163 | pmc = 2553819 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0050191 | editor1-last = Clarke | editor1-first = Mike }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar results were obtained for a study of publication of clinical trials of antidepressants in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Whittington CJ, Kendall T, Fonagy P, Cottrell D, Cotgrove A, Boddington E | title = Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in childhood depression: Systematic review of published versus unpublished data | journal = The Lancet | volume = 363 | issue = 9418 | pages = 1341–5 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15110490 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16043-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

====The STAR*D Trial====

The largest and most expensive study conducted to date, on the effectiveness of pharmacological treatment for depression, was commissioned by the [[National Institute of Mental Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) Study |url=http://www.nimh.nih.gov/trials/practical/stard/index.shtml |publisher=National Institute of Mental Health |accessdate=28 November 2012|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/6EszRRSYD |archivedate = 2013-03-05|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was dubbed &quot;[[STAR*D|The Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression]]&quot; (STAR*D) Study. The results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fava M, Rush AJ, Wisniewski SR, Nierenberg AA, Alpert JE, McGrath PJ, Thase ME, Warden D, Biggs M, Luther JF, Niederehe G, Ritz L, Trivedi MH | title = A Comparison of Mirtazapine and Nortriptyline Following Two Consecutive Failed Medication Treatments for Depressed Outpatients: A STAR*D Report | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 163 | issue = 7 | pages = 1161–72 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16816220 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.163.7.1161 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16554526&quot; /&gt; are summarized here.  
Participants in the trial were recruited when they sought medical care at general medical or psychiatric clinics. No advertising was used to recruit subjects in order to maximize the generalizability of the study results. Participants were required to have a minimum score of 14 point on the Hamiliton Depression Scale (HAM-D17) in order to be enrolled in the trial.  Generally accepted cutoffs are 7-17 points for mild depression, 8-24 points for moderate depression, and ≥ 24 for severe depression.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.springer.com/cda/content/document/cda_downloaddocument/9781588299666-c1.pdf?SGWID=0-0-45-802906-p173751812&lt;/ref&gt; The average participant baseline HAM-D17 score was 22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/data/Journals/AJP/4031/28.pdf |title=ajp.psychiatryonline.org |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pre-specified primary endpoint of this trial was remission as determined by the HAM-D score, with all patients with missing scores rated as non-responders.  In the aftermath of the trial, the investigators have presented the results mainly using the secondary endpoint of remission according to the QIDS-SR16 Score, which tend to be somewhat higher.
* After the first course of treatment, 27.5% of the 2,876 participants reached remission with a HAM-D score of 7 or less and 33% achieved remission according to the QIDS-SR scale. The response rate according to the QIDS-SR16 score was 47%.

A 2008 review of [[randomized controlled trial]]s concluded that symptomatic improvement with SSRIs was greatest by the end of the first week of use, but that some improvement continued for at least 6 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Taylor MJ, Freemantle N, Geddes JR, Bhagwagar Z | title = Early Onset of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor Antidepressant Action: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 63 | issue = 11 | pages = 1217–23 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17088502 | pmc = 2211759 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.63.11.1217 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Limitations and strategies====

Between 30% and 50% of individuals treated with a given antidepressant do not show a response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Baghai TC, Möller HJ, Rupprecht R | title = Recent Progress in Pharmacological and Non-Pharmacological Treatment Options of Major Depression | journal = Current Pharmaceutical Design | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 503–15 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16472142 | doi = 10.2174/138161206775474422 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SSRIswitch&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ruhé HG, Huyser J, Swinkels JA, Schene AH | title = Switching Antidepressants After a First Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor in Major Depressive Disorder | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 67 | issue = 12 | pages = 1836–55 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17194261 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v67n1203 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In clinical studies, approximately one-third of patients achieve a full [[remission (medicine)|remission]], one-third experience a response and one-third are nonresponders. Partial remission is characterized by the presence of poorly defined residual symptoms. These symptoms typically include depressed mood, psychic anxiety, sleep disturbance, fatigue and diminished interest or pleasure. It is currently unclear which factors predict partial remission. However, it is clear that residual symptoms are powerful predictors of relapse, with relapse rates 3–6 times higher in patients with residual symptoms than in those who experience full remission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tranter R, O'Donovan C, Chandarana P, Kennedy S | title = Prevalence and outcome of partial remission in depression | journal = Journal of psychiatry &amp; neuroscience | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 241–7 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12174733 | pmc = 161658 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, antidepressant drugs tend to lose efficacy over the course of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Byrne SE, Rothschild AJ | title = Loss of Antidepressant Efficacy During Maintenance Therapy | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 59 | issue = 6 | pages = 279–88 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9671339 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v59n0602 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of strategies are used in clinical practice to try to overcome these limits and variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mischoulon D, Nierenberg AA, Kizilbash L, Rosenbaum JF, Fava M | title = Strategies for managing depression refractory to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment: A survey of clinicians | journal = Canadian journal of psychiatry | volume = 45 | issue = 5 | pages = 476–81 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10900529 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They include switching medication, augmentation, and combination.

====&quot;Trial and error&quot; switching====

The [[American Psychiatric Association]] 2000 Practice Guideline advises that where no response is achieved following six to eight weeks of treatment with an antidepressant, to switch to an antidepressant in the same class, then to a different class of antidepressant. 
A 2006 meta-analysis review found wide variation in the findings of prior studies; for patients who had failed to respond to an SSRI antidepressant, between 12% and 86% showed a response to a new drug. However, the more antidepressants an individual had already tried, the less likely they were to benefit from a new antidepressant trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSRIswitch&quot;/&gt; However, a later meta-analysis found no difference between switching to a new drug and staying on the old medication; although 34% of treatment resistant patients responded when switched to the new drug, 40% responded without being switched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bschor T, Baethge C | title = No evidence for switching the antidepressant: Systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs of a common therapeutic strategy | journal = Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica | volume = 121 | issue = 3 | pages = 174–9 | year = 2010 | pmid = 19703121 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.2009.01458.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Augmentation and combination====

For a partial response, the American Psychiatric Association guidelines suggest augmentation, or adding a drug from a different class. These include: [[Lithium (medication)|lithium]] and [[thyroid]] augmentation, [[dopamine agonists]], [[sex steroids]], [[Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor|NRIs]], [[glucocorticoid]]-specific agents, or the newer [[anticonvulsant]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;augment&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = DeBattista C, Lembke A | title = Update on augmentation of antidepressant response in resistant depression | journal = Current Psychiatry Reports | volume = 7 | issue = 6 | pages = 435–40 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16318821 | doi = 10.1007/s11920-005-0064-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A combination strategy involves adding another antidepressant, usually from a different class so as to have effect on other mechanisms. Although this may be used in clinical practice, there is little evidence for the relative efficacy or adverse effects of this strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lam RW, Wan DD, Cohen NL, Kennedy SH | title = Combining Antidepressants for Treatment-Resistant Depression | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 63 | issue = 8 | pages = 685–93 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12197448 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v63n0805 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other tests recently conducted include the use of [[psychostimulant]]s as an augmentation therapy. Several studies have shown the efficacy of combining [[modafinil]] to treatment-resistant patients. It has been used to help combat SSRI associated fatigue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goss AJ, Kaser M, Costafreda SG, Sahakian BJ, Fu CH | title=Modafinil augmentation therapy in unipolar and bipolar depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry | volume = 74 | issue = 11 | pages = 1101–7| year = 2013 | pmid = 24330897 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.13r08560 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Long-term use====

The therapeutic effects of antidepressants typically do not continue once the course of medication ends, resulting in a high rate of [[relapse]]. A recent [[meta-analysis]] of 31 placebo-controlled antidepressant trials, mostly limited to studies covering a period of one year, found that 18% of patients who had responded to an antidepressant relapsed while still taking it, compared to 41% whose antidepressant was switched for a [[placebo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Geddes JR, Carney SM, Davies C, Furukawa TA, Kupfer DJ, Frank E, Goodwin GM | title = Relapse prevention with antidepressant drug treatment in depressive disorders: A systematic review | journal = The Lancet | volume = 361 | issue = 9358 | pages = 653–61 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12606176 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12599-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Where:'''

''For adverse effects/overdose toxicity''

4 means very strong effect/extreme toxicity.

3 strong effect; efficacious/high toxicity.

2 moderate effect/moderately toxic.

1 weak effect/weakly toxic.

v very weak/negligible effect

''For tolerability''

4 extremely tolerable. These drugs have proven to be better tolerated than the SSRIs.

3 very tolerable ? few, mild and transient side effects. These are drugs such as the [[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors|SSRIs]].

2 moderately tolerable. Some of the more tolerable of TCAs.

1 poor tolerability. TCAs and MAOIs mostly.

''For efficacy''

3 Superior efficacy drug, according to at least one review article.

2 Ordinary efficacy drug. Maybe some primary sources indicate superior efficacy relative to superior efficacy agents (e.g. agomelatine has shown superior efficacy to venlafaxine in one clinical trial) but insufficient data to say with much confidence.

1 Inferior efficacy compared to ordinary efficacy drugs, according to at least one review article.

'''Acronyms/terms used in the above table:'''

'''[[Tricyclic antidepressant]]s (TCAs)'''

[[Amitriptyline]]:
Preferentially (8x over norepinephrine) inhibits the reuptake of serotonin but norepinephrine reuptake inhibition is clinically significant.&lt;ref name = GG/&gt; Listed as a more hepatotoxic antidepressant in a recent review article.&lt;ref name=Hep&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Voican|first1=CS|last2=Corruble|first2=E|last3=Naveau|first3=S|last4=Perlemuter|first4=G|title=Antidepressant-induced liver injury: a review for clinicians.|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|date=April 2014|volume=171|issue=4|pages=404–15|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13050709|pmid=24362450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amoxapine]]:
Sometimes classed with the tetracyclic antidepressants. Has [[atypical antipsychotic]] actions too. Not available in Australia, Canada or the UK but available in the US. May be faster acting. Antidopaminergic, which means that it can cause [[extrapyramidal side effects]], [[tardive dyskinesia]] and [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMOXAPINE tablet [Watson Laboratories, Inc.] |work=DailyMed |publisher=Watson Laboratories, Inc. |date=August 2010 |accessdate=30 October 2013 |url=http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=a16297df-3158-48db-85e5-5cd506885556|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131102093757/http://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/lookup.cfm?setid=a16297df-3158-48db-85e5-5cd506885556 |archivedate=2013-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Causes kidney failure and seizures in overdose, although it usually does not cause cardiotoxic effects in overdose.&lt;ref name=&quot;CPT&quot; /&gt;

[[Clomipramine]]:
Highly selective (~120x) for serotonin reuptake inhibition. More epileptogenic than other TCAs.&lt;ref name = GG/&gt;

[[Desipramine]]:
Preferentially inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine (22x over serotonin).&lt;ref name = GG/&gt;

[[Dosulepin]] (Dothiepin):
Not available in the US. Available in Australia (where it is still commonly referred to as dothiepin) and the UK.&lt;br&gt;
Weight gain: probably 2&lt;br&gt;
Danger in overdose: 4 &lt;ref name=&quot;AMH&quot;/&gt;

[[Doxepin]]:
Somewhat selective for inhibiting norepinephrine reuptake (2.3x over serotonin).

Fairly selective (~90x over dopamine) norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.&lt;ref name = GG/&gt;

[[Nortriptyline]]:
Active metabolite of amitriptyline. Somewhat selective (4.2x) for norepinephrine reuptake inhibition.

[[Protriptyline]]:
Relatively (14x over serotonin) selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibition.

[[Tianeptine]]:
Enhances the reuptake of serotonin and increases dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission. Not approved for clinical use in Australia, Canada, the UK, the US and Ireland. More hepatotoxic than most other antidepressants.&lt;ref name = Hep/&gt;

[[Trimipramine]]:
Has antidopaminergic effects and hence can cause extrapyramidal side effects, [[tardive dyskinesia]] and [[neuroleptic malignant syndrome]].

'''[[Monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] (MAOIs)'''

[[Isocarboxazid]]:
Not licensed for use in Australia.

[[Moclobemide]]:
Only clinically utilized [[reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A]] (RIMA). Not approved for use in the US. Approved for clinical use in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa and the UK.&lt;br&gt;
Activating effects: ? (insomnia common according to the AMH)

[[Phenelzine]]:
Phenelzine is more prone than tranylcypromine and most other antidepressant to causing liver damage.&lt;ref name = Hep/&gt;

[[Seligiline]]:
Originally used a treatment for Parkinson's disease due to its selective, irreversible inhibition of [[MAO-B]] but at higher doses [[MAO-A]] inhibition occurs.

[[Tranylcypromine]]:
Metabolized into amphetamine analogues ''in vivo''. Can cause liver damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMH&quot;/&gt;

'''[[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs)'''

[[Citalopram]]:
Most likely of the SSRIs to prolong the [[QT interval]]. Also the most toxic SSRI in overdose.  Less hepatotoxic than most other antidepressants.&lt;ref name = Hep/&gt;&lt;br&gt;
[[QT interval|QTc i. p.]]: 2 (dose dependent; doses &gt;40&amp;nbsp;mg/day are particularly dangerous)

[[Escitalopram]]:
The more active S-enantiomer of citalopram. May be the most efficacious of the SSRIs (although no statistically significant difference between the efficacy of sertraline and escitalopram have been teased out to date). Based on the available evidence it is less toxic than its racemic counterpart, (R,S)-citalopram, in overdose. Less hepatotoxic than most other antidepressants.&lt;ref name = Hep/&gt;

[[Fluoxetine]]:
First SSRI to receive FDA approval in 1987. Some studies have shown slight (often statistically insignificant) weight reductions in those on fluoxetine. Has the longest net half-life (taking into account the effects of its active metabolite, [[norfluoxetine]]) of any antidepressant clinically used, and consequently, when abruptly stopped, withdrawal effects are usually mild and rare. Dermatologic reactions are more common than with sertraline.&lt;ref name =Martindale/&gt;

[[Fluvoxamine]]:
Not [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approved for major depression; FDA approved for [[Obsessive-compulsive disorder|OCD]].

Only SSRI that's not Australian pregnancy category C but is rather category D due to an increased risk of [[Persistent fetal circulation|Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn]]. The [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] of the US has placed it in category D. It is associated with a higher risk of sexual dysfunction, weight gain, anticholinergic side effects and drowsiness than the other SSRIs. Has a short half life compared to other SSRIs and hence is the most prone to causing withdrawal effects whenever a dose is missed.

===Anxiety Disorders===

====Generalized anxiety disorder====
Antidepressants are recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for the treatment of [[generalized anxiety disorder]] (GAD) that has failed to respond to conservative measures such as education and self-help activities. GAD is a common disorder of which the central feature is excessive worry about a number of different events. Key symptoms include excessive anxiety about multiple events and issues, and difficulty controlling worrisome thoughts that persists for at least 6 months.

Antidepressants provide a modest-to-moderate reduction in anxiety in GAD,&lt;ref name=&quot;urlwww.nice.org.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13314/52599/52599.pdf |title=www.nice.org.uk |format= |work= |accessdate=2013-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are superior to placebo in treating GAD.&lt;ref name = Kapczinski&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kapczinski F, Lima MS, Souza JS, Schmitt R | title = Antidepressants for generalized anxiety disorder | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume =  | issue = 2 | pages = CD003592 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12804478 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003592 | url =  | editor1-last = Kapczinski | editor1-first = Flavio FK }}&lt;/ref&gt; The efficacy of different antidepressants is similar.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlwww.nice.org.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = Kapczinski/&gt;

====Obsessive compulsive disorder====
SSRIs are a second line treatment of adult [[obsessive compulsive disorder]] (OCD) with mild functional impairment and as first line treatment for those with moderate or severe impairment.  In children, SSRIs can be considered as a second line therapy in those with moderate-to-severe impairment, with close monitoring for psychiatric adverse effects.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/cg031niceguideline.pdf |title=www.nice.org.uk |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; SSRIs are efficacious in the treatment of OCD; patients treated with SSRIs are about twice as likely to respond to treatment as those treated with placebo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Arroll B, Elley CR, Fishman T, Goodyear-Smith FA, Kenealy T, Blashki G, Kerse N, Macgillivray S | title = Antidepressants versus placebo for depression in primary care | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume =  | issue = 3 | pages = CD007954 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19588448 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007954 | url =  | editor1-last = Arroll | editor1-first = Bruce }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/570825+ |title=Medscape Log In |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eating Disorders===

Anti-depressants are recommended as an alternative or additional first step to self-help programs in the treatment of [[bulimia nervosa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;urlwww.nice.org.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/pdf/CG9FullGuideline.pdf |title=www.nice.org.uk |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SSRIs (fluoxetine in particular) are preferred over other anti-depressants due to their acceptability, tolerability, and superior reduction of symptoms in short term trials. Long term efficacy remains poorly characterized.  [[Bupropion]] is not recommended for the treatment of eating disorders due to an increased risk of seizure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a695033.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar recommendations apply to [[binge eating disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;urlwww.nice.org.uk&quot; /&gt; SSRIs provide short term reductions in binge eating behavior, but have not been associated with significant weight loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlNational Guideline Clearinghouse | Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with eating disorders.&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guidelines.gov/content.aspx?id=9318+ |title=National Guideline Clearinghouse &amp;#124; Practice guideline for the treatment of patients with eating disorders |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pain===

====Fibromyalgia====

A 2012 meta analysis concluded that antidepressants treatment favorably affects pain, health-related quality of life, depression, and sleep in fibromylgia syndrome.  Tricyclics appear to be the most effective class, with moderate effects on pain and sleep and small effects on fatigue and health-related quality of life. The fraction of people experiencing a 30% pain reduction on tricyclics was 48% vs 28% for placebo.  For SSRIs and SNRIs the fraction of people experiencing a 30% pain reduction was 36% (20% in the placebo comparator arms) and 42% (32% in the corresponding placebo comparator arms). Discontinuation of treatment due to side effects was common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Häuser W, Wolfe F, Tölle T, Uçeyler N, Sommer C | title = The role of antidepressants in the management of fibromyalgia syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = CNS Drugs | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 297–307 |date=April 2012 | pmid = 22452526 | doi = 10.2165/11598970-000000000-00000 | url =   }}&lt;/ref&gt; Antidepressants including amitriptyline, fluoxetine, duloxetine, milnacipran, moclobemide, and pirlindole are recommended by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) for the treatment of fibromyalgia based on &quot;limited evidence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enfa-europe.eu/assets/downloads/eular.pdf |title=www.enfa-europe.eu |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neuropathic Pain====

A 2014 meta analysis from the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] found the antidepressant duloxetine effective for the treatment of pain resulting from diabetic neuropathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lunn MP, Hughes RA, Wiffen PJ | title = Duloxetine for treating painful neuropathy, chronic pain or fibromyalgia | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 1 | issue =  | pages = CD007115 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24385423 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD007115.pub3 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same group reviewed data for amitryptyline in the treatment of neuropathic pain and found limited useful randomized clinical trial data, but concluded that the long history of successful use in the community for the treatment of fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain justified its continued use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moore RA, Derry S, Aldington D, Cole P, Wiffen PJ | title = Amitriptyline for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia in adults | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 12 | issue =  | pages = CD008242 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23235657 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD008242.pub2 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MAOIs]] tend to have pronounced (sometimes fatal) interactions with a wide variety of medications and [[over-the-counter drug]]s.

Although these reactions may be lethal, the total number of deaths due to interactions and dietary concerns is comparable to over-the-counter medications.--&gt;

In response to these adverse effects, a different type of MAOI has been developed: the [[reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A]] (RIMA) class of drugs. Their primary advantage is that they do not require the person to follow a special diet, while being purportedly effective as SSRIs and tricyclics in treating depressive disorders.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid7717091&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Paykel ES | title = Clinical efficacy of reversible and selective inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A in major depression | journal = Acta Psychiatr Scand Suppl | volume = 386 | issue =  | pages = 22–7 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7717091 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1995.tb05920.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pregnancy===

SSRI use in pregnancy has been associated with a variety of risks with varying degrees of proof of causation.  As depression is independently associated with negative pregnancy outcomes, determining the extent to which observed associations between antidepressant use and specific adverse outcomes reflects a causative relationship has been difficult in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Malm H | title = Prenatal exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and infant outcome | journal = Ther Drug Monit | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 607–14 |date=December 2012 | pmid = 23042258 | doi = 10.1097/FTD.0b013e31826d07ea | url =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other cases, the attribution of adverse outcomes to antidepressant exposure seems fairly clear.

Several studies have pointed to an increased risk of prematurity associated with SSRI use, and this association may be due to an increase risk of [[pre-eclampsia]] of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sivagnanam |first=G |title=Antidepressants |journal=Journal of Pharmacology and Pharmacotherapeutics |year=2012 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=287–8 |url=http://www.jpharmacol.com/text.asp?2012/3/3/287/99452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antidepressant-induced mania===
Another possible problem with antidepressants is the chance of antidepressant-induced mania in patients with [[bipolar disorder]]. Many cases of bipolar depression are very similar to those of unipolar depression. Therefore, the patient can be misdiagnosed with unipolar depression and be given antidepressants. Studies have shown that antidepressant-induced mania can occur in 20–40% of bipolar patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Goldberg JF, Truman CJ | title = Antidepressant-induced mania: An overview of current controversies | journal = Bipolar Disorders | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 407–20 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14636364 | doi = 10.1046/j.1399-5618.2003.00067.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; For bipolar depression, antidepressants (most frequently SSRIs) can exacerbate or trigger symptoms of [[hypomania]] and [[mania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9387089&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Benazzi F | title = Antidepressant-associated hypomania in outpatient depression: a 203-case study in private practice | journal = J Affect Disord | volume = 46 | issue = 1 | pages = 73–7 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9387089 | doi = 10.1016/S0165-0327(97)00082-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suicide===
{{main|Antidepressants and suicide risk}}

Studies have shown that the use of antidepressants is correlated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour and thinking (suicidality) in those aged under 25.&lt;ref name=&quot;StoneETAL&quot; /&gt; This problem has been serious enough to warrant government intervention by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to warn of the increased risk of suicidality during antidepressant treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17485726&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Friedman RA, Leon AC | title = Expanding the black box - depression, antidepressants, and the risk of suicide | journal = N.

Sexual side-effects are also common with SSRIs, such as loss of [[sexual drive]], [[anorgasmia|failure to reach orgasm]], and [[erectile dysfunction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Potenza|first=edited by Jon E.

Biochemical mechanisms suggested as causative include increased serotonin, particularly affecting [[5-HT2 receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[5HT3 receptor|5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors]]; decreased [[dopamine]]; decreased [[norepinephrine]]; blockade of [[cholinergic receptor|cholinergic]] and [[alpha-1 adrenergic receptor|α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;adrenergic receptors]]; inhibition of [[nitric oxide synthase|nitric oxide synthetase]]; and elevation of [[prolactin]] levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Keltner NL, McAfee KM, Taylor CL | title = Biological Perspectives | journal = Perspectives in Psychiatric Care | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 111–6 | year = 2009 | pmid = 12385082 | doi = 10.1111/j.1744-6163.2002.tb00665.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mirtazapine]] is reported to have fewer sexual side-effects, most likely because it antagonizes 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and may, in some cases, reverse sexual dysfunction induced by SSRIs by the same mechanism.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18278806&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ozmenler NK, Karlidere T, Bozkurt A, Yetkin S, Doruk A, Sutcigil L, Cansever A, Uzun O, Ozgen F, Ozsahin A | title = Mirtazapine augmentation in depressed patients with sexual dysfunction due to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors | journal = Hum Psychopharmacol | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 321–6 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18278806 | doi = 10.1002/hup.929 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changes in weight===
Changes in appetite or weight are common among antidepressants, but largely drug-dependent and are related to which neurotransmitters they affect.

The [[antihistamine|antihistaminic]] properties of certain TCA- and TeCA-class antidepressants have been shown to contribute to the common side-effects of increased appetite and weight gain associated with these classes of medication.

===Discontinuation syndrome===
{{Main|Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome}}

Antidepressant discontinuation symptoms were first reported with [[imipramine]], the first tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), in the late 1950s, and each new class of antidepressants has brought reports of similar conditions, including [[monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] (MAOIs), SSRIs, and SNRIs.  As of 2001, at least 21 different antidepressants, covering all the major classes, were known to cause discontinuation syndromes.&lt;ref name=&quot;DrugSaf2001-Haddad&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Haddad, P. |title=Antidepressant discontinuation syndromes |journal=Drug Saf |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=183–97 |year=2001 |pmid=11347722 |doi=10.2165/00002018-200124030-00003}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The problem has been poorly studied, and most of the literature has been case reports or small clinical studies; incidence is hard to determine and controversial.&lt;ref name=&quot;DrugSaf2001-Haddad&quot; /&gt;

People with discontinuation syndrome have been on an antidepressant for at least four weeks and have recently stopped taking the medication, either abruptly or after a fast taper.&lt;ref name=&quot;WarnerAFP&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Warner CH, Bobo W, Warner C, Reid S, Rachal J |title=Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages=449–56 |date=August 2006  |pmid=16913164 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Common symptoms include flu-like symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headaches, sweating), sleep disturbances (insomnia, nightmares, constant sleepiness), sensory/movement disturbances (imbalance, tremors, [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]], dizziness, electric-shock-like experiences), mood disturbances ([[dysphoria]], anxiety, agitation) and cognitive disturbances (confusion and hyperarousal).&lt;ref name=&quot;WarnerAFP&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haddad2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haddad |first=P.M. |last2=Anderson |first2=I.M. |year=2007 |title=Recognising and managing antidepressant discontinuation symptoms |journal=Advances in Psychiatric Treatment |volume=13 |issue=6 |page=447 |doi=10.1192/apt.bp.105.001966}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Renoir2013&gt;{{cite journal | author = Renoir T |date=Apr 2013  | title = Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressant treatment discontinuation syndrome: a review of the clinical evidence and the possible mechanisms involved | url = | journal = Front Pharmacol | volume = 4 | issue = | page = 45 | doi = 10.3389/fphar.2013.00045 | pmid = 23596418 | pmc=3627130}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over fifty symptoms have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Haddad PM, Dursun SM |date=Jan 2008  | title = Neurological complications of psychiatric drugs: clinical features and management | url = | journal = Hum Psychopharmacol | volume = 23 | issue = Suppl 1| pages = 15–26 | pmid = 18098217 | doi=10.1002/hup.918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most cases of discontinuation syndrome last between one and four weeks, are relatively mild, and resolve on their own; in rare cases symptoms can be severe or extended.&lt;ref name=&quot;WarnerAFP&quot;/&gt;   Paroxetine and venlafaxine seem to be particularly difficult to discontinue and prolonged withdrawal syndrome lasting over 18 months have been reported with paroxetine.&lt;ref name=&quot;DrugSaf2001-Haddad&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tamam |first=L. |last2=Ozpoyraz |first2=N. |title=Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor Discontinuation Syndrome: A Review |journal=Advances in Therapy |date=January–February 2002 |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=17–26 |url=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02850015?LI=true |accessdate=2012-11-28 |doi=10.1007/BF02850015 |pmid=12008858}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2ndGenReview&quot;&gt;Gartlehner G, Hansen RA, Morgan LC, et al.

With the explosion of use and interest in SSRIs in the late 1980s and early 1990s, focused especially on [[Prozac#Popular culture|Prozac]], interest grew as well in discontinuation syndromes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/magazine/06antidepressant-t.html|work=New York Times |title=Self-Nonmedication |first=Bruce |last=Stutz |date=2007-05-06 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 1990s, some investigators thought that symptoms that emerged when antidepressants were discontinued, might mean that antidepressants were causing [[addiction]], and some used the term &quot;withdrawal syndrome&quot; to describe the symptoms.  Addictive substances cause [[physiological dependence]], so that [[drug withdrawal]] causes suffering.  These theories were abandoned, since addiction leads to [[drug-seeking behavior]], and people taking antidepressants do not exhibit drug-seeking behavior.  The term &quot;withdrawal syndrome&quot; is no longer used with respect to antidepressants, to avoid confusion with problems that arise from addiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;WarnerAFP&quot;/&gt;

==Pharmacology==
{{Main|Pharmacology of antidepressants}}
The earliest and probably most widely accepted scientific theory of antidepressant action is the [[monoamine hypothesis]] (which can be traced back to the 1950s), which states that depression is due to an imbalance (most often a deficiency) of the [[monoamine neurotransmitter]]s (namely [[serotonin]], [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]]).&lt;ref name = GG/&gt; It was originally proposed based on the observation that certain hydrazine anti-tuberculosis agents produce antidepressant effects, which was later linked to their inhibitory effects on [[monoamine oxidase]], the enzyme that catalyses the breakdown of the monoamine neurotransmitters.&lt;ref name = GG/&gt; All currently marketed antidepressants have the monoamine hypothesis as their theoretical basis, with the possible exception of [[agomelatine]] which acts on a dual [[Melatonin|melatonergic]]-[[Serotonin|serotonergic]] pathway.&lt;ref name = GG/&gt; Despite the success of the monoamine hypothesis it has a number of limitations: for one, all monoaminergic antidepressants have a delayed onset of action of at least a week; and secondly, there are a sizeable portion (&gt;40%) of depressed patients that do not adequately respond to monoaminergic antidepressants.&lt;ref name=&quot;Infl&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Maes M, Yirmyia R, Noraberg J, Brene S, Hibbeln J, Perini G, Kubera M, Bob P, Lerer B, Maj M | title = The inflammatory &amp; neurodegenerative (I&amp;ND) hypothesis of depression: leads for future research and new drug developments in depression | journal = Metabolic Brain Disease | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–53 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19085093 | doi = 10.1007/s11011-008-9118-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;glut&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sanacora G, Treccani G, Popoli M | title = Towards a glutamate hypothesis of depression: an emerging frontier of neuropsychopharmacology for mood disorders | journal = Neuropharmacology | volume = 62 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–77 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 21827775 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.07.036 | url = http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3205453/pdf/nihms318867.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = | pmc=3205453}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of alternative hypotheses have been proposed, including the glutamate, neurogenic, [[Epigenetics|epigenetic]], cortisol hypersecretion and inflammatory hypotheses.&lt;ref name = Infl/&gt;&lt;ref name = glut/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Epig&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Menke A, Klengel T, Binder EB | title = Epigenetics, depression and antidepressant treatment | journal = Current Pharmaceutical Design | volume = 18 | issue = 36 | pages = 5879–5889 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22681167 | doi = 10.2174/138161212803523590 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Epig2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vialou V, Feng J, Robison AJ, Nestler EJ | title = Epigenetic mechanisms of depression and antidepressant action | journal = Annual Review of Pharmacology and Toxicology | volume = 53 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–87 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23020296 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-pharmtox-010611-134540 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
{{See also|List of antidepressants}}

==Adjuncts==

Adjunct medications are an umbrella term used to describe substances that increase the potency or &quot;enhance&quot; antidepressants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/psychiatric_disorders/mood_disorders/depressive_disorders.html?qt=depression&amp;alt=sh#v1028590 |work=Merck Manual |title=Depressive Disorders |accessdate=30 November 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131205163219/http://www.merckmanuals.com/professional/psychiatric_disorders/mood_disorders/depressive_disorders.html?qt=depression&amp;alt=sh |archivedate=2013-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They work by affecting variables very close to the antidepressant, sometimes affecting a completely different [[mechanism of action]]. This is may be attempted when depression treatments have not been successful in the past.

Types of adjunct medication techniques generally fall into the following categories:
* Two or more antidepressants taken together
** From the same class (affecting the same area of the brain, often at a much higher level)
** From different classes (affecting multiple parts of the brain not covered simultaneously by either drug alone)
* A [[psychostimulant|stimulant]] with an antidepressant (e.g., amphetamine and fluoxetine)
* An [[antipsychotic]], particularly [[atypical antipsychotic]]s, for reasons not clearly understood

A review article published in 2007 found psychostimulants may be effective in treatment-resistant depression with concomitant antidepressant therapy. A more certain conclusion could not be drawn due to substantial deficiencies in the studies available for consideration, and the somewhat contradictory nature of their results.&lt;!--

commented out 19 November 2013

However, the authors claim psychostimulants are likely to have a higher level of clinical effectiveness under circumstances in which the patient will probably die soon, so rapid relief is of great importance. In this situation, the patient is likely to die before dependence on, or tolerance of, the medication interferes with their care.

Chronic nicotine intake via nicotine patches results in an increased response to standard antidepressants.

===Nutrition===

[[Omega-3 fatty acids]] have been proposed as a treatment for depression, alone or in combination with other treatments. One small pilot study of childhood depression (ages 6–12) suggested omega 3 fatty acids may have therapeutic benefits for treating childhood depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16741212&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nemets H, Nemets B, Apter A, Bracha Z, Belmaker RH | title = Omega-3 treatment of childhood depression: a controlled, double-blind pilot study | journal = Am J Psychiatry | volume = 163 | issue = 6 | pages = 1098–100 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16741212 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.163.6.1098 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 review article that included [[double-blind studies]], [[randomized control trials]], and epidemiological studies linking omega-3 fatty acids consumption and depression found that low fish consumption (the primary source of omega-3 fatty acids) correlated to increased rates of depression. Additionally, case-control and cohort studies of unipolar and [[postpartum depression]] indicated low blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids in depressed patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16337677&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sontrop J, Campbell MK | title = Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and depression: a review of the evidence and a methodological critique | journal = Prev Med | volume = 42 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–13 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16337677 | doi = 10.1016/j.ypmed.2005.11.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 review of clinical studies of the effectiveness of omega-3 fatty acids on depression has shown somewhat inconsistent results: &quot;Of the evaluated studies, 13 showed a significant positive association between omega-3 and depression, while six studies did not show a relationship between the referred variables.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rocha Araujo DM, Vilarim MM, Nardi AE | title = What is the effectiveness of the use of polyunsaturated fatty acid omega-3 in the treatment of depression? | journal = Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics | volume = 10 | issue = 7 | pages = 1117–29 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20586692 | doi = 10.1586/ern.10.77 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To be read with caution because of limited data, a 2008 [[Cochrane Library|Cochrane]] systematic review found in the one eligible study that omega-3 fatty acids are an effective [[adjunctive therapy]] for depressed but not manic symptoms in [[bipolar disorder]].

===Isoniazid, iproniazid, and imipramine===
In 1951, [[Irving Selikoff]] and Edward Robitzek, working out of Sea View Hospital on [[Staten Island]], began clinical trials on two new [[tuberculosis|anti-tuberculosis]] agents developed by Hoffman-LaRoche, [[isoniazid]] and [[iproniazid]]. Only patients with a poor [[prognosis]] were initially treated; nevertheless, their condition improved dramatically. Selikoff and Robitzek noted &quot;a subtle general stimulation ... the patients exhibited renewed vigor and indeed this occasionally served to introduce disciplinary problems.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid14906149&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Selikoff IJ, Robitzek EH | title = Tuberculosis Chemotherapy with Hydrazine Derivatives of Isonicotinic Acid | journal = CHEST Journal | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 385–438 | year = 1952 | pmid = 14906149 | doi = 10.1378/chest.21.4.385 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The promise of a cure for tuberculosis in the Sea View Hospital trials was excitedly discussed in the mainstream press.

In 1952, learning of the stimulating side effects of isoniazid, the Cincinnati psychiatrist Max Lurie tried it on his patients. In the following year, he and Harry Salzer reported that isoniazid improved depression in two thirds of their patients and coined the term ''antidepressant'' to describe its action.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-88048-397-0&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Healy |first=D |editor1-last=Weissman |editor1-first=M.M. |title=The treatment of depression: bridging the 21st century |url=http://books.google.com/?id=LAmBVolIG5kC |accessdate=28 May 2009 |year=2001 |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub |isbn=978-0-88048-397-1 |pages=10–11 |chapter=The Antidepressant Drama |chapterurl=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LAmBVolIG5kC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA7,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar incident took place in Paris, where Jean Delay, head of psychiatry at Sainte-Anne Hospital, heard of this effect from his [[pulmonology]] colleagues at Cochin Hospital. In 1952 (before Lurie and Salzer), Delay, with the resident Jean-Francois Buisson, reported the positive effect of isoniazid on depressed patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;Healy96&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Healy |first=David |title=The psychopharmacologists: interviews |year=1996 |publisher=Chapman and Hall |location=London |isbn=978-1-86036-008-4 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mode of antidepressant action of isoniazid is still unclear. It is speculated that its effect is due to the inhibition of [[diamine oxidase]], coupled with a weak inhibition of [[monoamine oxidase A]].&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn1-86036-010-6&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Healy |first=David |title=The Psychopharmacologists: Volume 2 |publisher=A Hodder Arnold Publication |year=1998 |pages=132–4 |isbn=978-1-86036-010-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selikoff and Robitzek also experimented with another anti-tuberculosis drug, [[iproniazid]]; it showed a greater psychostimulant effect, but more pronounced toxicity.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12998444&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Robitzek EH, Selikoff IJ, Mamlok E, Tendlau A | title = Isoniazid and Its Isopropyl Derivative in the Therapy of Tuberculosis in Humans: Comparative Therapeutic and Toxicologic Properties | journal = CHEST Journal | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–15 | year = 1953 | pmid = 12998444 | doi = 10.1378/chest.23.1.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Jackson Smith, Gordon Kamman, George Crane, and [[Frank Ayd]], described the psychiatric applications of iproniazid. Ernst Zeller found iproniazid to be a potent [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18004120&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = López-Muñoz F, Alamo C, Juckel G, Assion HJ | title = Half a Century of Antidepressant Drugs | journal = Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 555–9 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18004120 | doi = 10.1097/jcp.0b013e3181bb617 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, iproniazid remained relatively obscure until Nathan Kline, the influential and flamboyant head of research at Rockland State Hospital, began to popularize it in the medical and popular press as a &quot;psychic energizer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18004120&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Psychic Energizer |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,862555,00.html |date=15 April 1957 |work=Time |accessdate=28 May 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130811223331/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,862555,00.html |archivedate=2013-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roche put a significant marketing effort behind iproniazid.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18004120&quot; /&gt; Its sales grew until it was recalled in 1961, due to reports of lethal [[hepatotoxicity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18004120&quot;/&gt;

The antidepressant effect of a [[tricyclic]], a three ringed compound, was first discovered in 1957 by [[Roland Kuhn]] in a Swiss [[psychiatric hospital]]. [[Antihistamine]] derivatives were used to treat surgical shock and later as [[neuroleptics]]. Although in 1955 [[reserpine]] was shown to be more effective than placebo in alleviating anxious depression, neuroleptics were being developed as [[sedatives]] and [[antipsychotics]].{{medical citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Attempting to improve the effectiveness of [[chlorpromazine]], Kuhn{{spaced ndash}} in conjunction with the [[Geigy]] [[Pharmaceutical Company]]{{spaced ndash}} discovered the compound &quot;G 22355&quot;, later renamed [[imipramine]]. Imipramine had a beneficial effect in patients with depression who showed mental and [[motor retardation]]. Kuhn described his new compound as a &quot;thymoleptic&quot; &quot;taking hold of the emotions,&quot; in contrast with neuroleptics, &quot;taking hold of the nerves&quot; in 1955–56. These gradually became established, resulting in the patent and manufacture in the US in 1951 by Häfliger and SchinderA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kuhn R | title = The treatment of depressive states with G 22355 (imipramine hydrochloride) | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 115 | issue = 5 | pages = 459–64 | year = 1958 | pmid = 13583250 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second generation antidepressants===
{{Main|Second-generation antidepressants}}

Antidepressants became [[prescription drug]]s in the 1950s. It was estimated that no more than 50 to 100 individuals per million suffered from the kind of depression that these new drugs would treat, and pharmaceutical companies were not enthusiastic in marketing for this small market. Sales through the 1960s remained poor compared to the sales of tranquilizers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tranquilizers |url=http://www.cmcsb.com/tranquil.htm |work=Cumberland Moutain Community Services |publisher=www.cmcsb.com |accessdate=20 November 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916074410/http://www.cmcsb.com/tranquil.htm |archivedate=16 September 2012}}{{Unreliable medical source|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were being marketed for different uses.&lt;ref name=&quot;3faces&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Healy D | title = The Three Faces of the Antidepressants: A Critical Commentary on the Clinical-Economic Context of Diagnosis | journal = The Journal of Nervous &amp; Mental Disease | volume = 187 | issue = 3 | pages = 174–80 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10086474 | doi = 10.1097/00005053-199903000-00007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Imipramine remained in common use and numerous successors were introduced. The use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) increased after the development and introduction of &quot;reversible&quot; forms affecting only the MAO-A subtype of inhibitors, making this drug safer to use.&lt;ref name=&quot;3faces&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pletscher A | title = The discovery of antidepressants: A winding path | journal = Experientia | volume = 47 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–8 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1999242 | doi = 10.1007/BF02041242 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s, it was thought that the mode of action of tricyclics was to inhibit norepinephrine reuptake. However, norepinephrine reuptake became associated with stimulating effects. Later tricyclics were thought to affect [[serotonin]] as proposed in 1969 by Carlsson and Lindqvist as well as Lapin and Oxenkrug.{{medical citation needed|date=March 2013}}

Researchers began a process of [[rational drug design]] to isolate antihistamine-derived compounds that would selectively target these systems. The first such compound to be patented was [[zimelidine]] in 1971, while the first released clinically was [[indalpine]]. [[Fluoxetine]] was approved for commercial use by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1988, becoming the first [[Blockbuster drug|blockbuster]] SSRI. Fluoxetine was developed at [[Eli Lilly and Company]] in the early 1970s by Bryan Molloy, [[Klaus Schmiegel]], David Wong and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Domino EF | title = History of modern psychopharmacology: A personal view with an emphasis on antidepressants | journal = Psychosomatic Medicine | volume = 61 | issue = 5 | pages = 591–8 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10511010 | doi = 10.1097/00006842-199909000-00002 | url = http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10511010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wong DT, Bymaster FP, Horng JS, Molloy BB | title = A new selective inhibitor for uptake of serotonin into synaptosomes of rat brain: 3-(p-trifluoromethylphenoxy).

[[Hypericum perforatum|St John's wort]] fell out of favor in most countries through the 19th and 20th centuries, except in [[Germany]], where [[Hypericum]] extracts were eventually licensed, packaged and prescribed.

==Society and culture==

===Prescription trends===

In the United States, antidepressants were the most commonly prescribed medication in 2013.&lt;ref name=AJantidepressantstatsUS /&gt; Of the estimated 16 million &quot;long term&quot; (over 24 months) users, roughly 70 percent are female.&lt;ref name=AJantidepressantstatsUS&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Rebecca|title=Waking up from sadness: Many find trouble getting off antidepressants|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/1/22/patients-mostly-womenfindtroublegettingoffofantidepressants.html|website=Al Jazeera|accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, figures reported in 2010 indicated that the number of antidepressant prescribed by the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) almost doubled over a decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/jun/11/antidepressant-prescriptions-rise-nhs-recession |title=Antidepressant Use Rises as Recession Feeds Wave of Worry |date=11 June 2010 |accessdate=1 July 2010 |location=London |newspaper=The Guardian |first=Rowenna |last=Davis |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615165456/http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/jun/11/antidepressant-prescriptions-rise-nhs-recession? |archivedate=15 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further analysis published in 2014 showed that number of antidepressants dispensed annually in the community went up by 25 million in the 14 years between 1998 and 2012, rising form 15 million to 40 million. Nearly 50% of this rise occurred in the four years after the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2008 banking crash]], during which time the annual increase in prescriptions rose from 6.7% to 8.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spence|first1=Ruth|title=Focus on: Antidepressant prescribing|url=http://www.qualitywatch.org.uk/focus-on/antidepressant-prescribing|website=QualityWatch|publisher=QualityWatch (Nuffield Trust/Health Foundation)|accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sources also suggest that aside from the recession, other factors that may influence changes in prescribing rates may include: improvements in diagnosis, a reduction of the [[Social stigma|stigma]] surrounding mental health, broader prescribing trends, GP characteristics, geographical location and housing status. Another factor that contribute to increasing consumption of antidepressants is the fact that these medications now are used for other conditions including [[social anxiety]] and [[post traumatic stress]].

'''Netherlands:''' In the Netherlands, [[paroxetine]], marketed as Seroxat among generic preparations, is the most prescribed antidepressant, followed by the tricyclic antidepressant [[amitriptyline]], [[citalopram]] and [[venlafaxine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gipdatabank.nl/index.asp?scherm=tabellenFrameSet&amp;infoType=g&amp;tabel=01-basis&amp;item=N06AB |title=GIPdatabank |publisher=Gipdatabank.nl |accessdate=6 November 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206123718/http://www.gipdatabank.nl/index.asp?scherm=tabellenFrameSet&amp;infoType=g&amp;tabel=01-basis&amp;item=N06AB |archivedate=6 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MAOIs can be as effective as tricyclic antidepressants, although they generally are used less frequently because they have a higher incidence of dangerous side effects and interactions.

===Social science perspective===
In looking at the issue of antidepressant use, some academics have highlighted the need to examine the use of antidepressants and other medical treatments in cross cultural terms, due to the fact that often various cultures prescribe and observe different manifestations, symptoms, meanings and associations of depression and other medical conditions within their populations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ecks_2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ecks S | title = Pharmaceutical Citizenship: Antidepressant Marketing and the Promise of Demarginalization in India | journal = Anthropology &amp; Medicine | year = 2005 | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 239–254 | doi=10.1080/13648470500291360}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Lock_2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Lock M, Nguyen VK | title = An anthropology of biomedicine | date = 2010 | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location  = Chichester, West Sussex | isbn = 1405110716 | edition = 1st| chapter = &quot;Local Biologies and Human Difference | pages = 83–109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These cross-cultural discrepancies, it has been argued, then have implications on the perceived efficacy and use of antidepressants and other strategies in the treatment of depression in these different cultures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ecks_2005&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lock_2010&quot;/&gt; In India antidepressants are largely seen as tools to combat marginality, promising the individual the ability to re-integrate themself into society through their use, a view and association not observed in the West.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ecks_2005&quot;/&gt;
