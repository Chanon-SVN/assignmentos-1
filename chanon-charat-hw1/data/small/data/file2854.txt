The '''BeBox''' is a dual CPU [[personal computer]], briefly sold by [[Be Inc.]] to run the company's own [[operating system]], [[BeOS]]. Notable aspects of the system include its CPU configuration, I/O board with &quot;GeekPort&quot;, and &quot;[[Blinkenlights]]&quot; on the front bezel.

The BeBox made its debut in October 1995 (BeBox Dual603-66). The processors were upgraded to 133&amp;nbsp;MHz in August 1996 (BeBox Dual603e-133). Production was halted in January 1997,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bebox.nu/history.php?s=history/1997 BeBox History] The BeBox Zone&lt;/ref&gt; following the port of BeOS to the [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]], in order for the company to concentrate on software. Be sold around 1000 66&amp;nbsp;MHz BeBoxes and 800 133&amp;nbsp;MHz BeBoxes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://testou.free.fr/www.beatjapan.org/mirror/www.be.com/support/qandas/faqs/faq-0261.html] Be, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

== CPU configuration ==

Initial prototypes are equipped with two [[AT&amp;T Hobbit]] processors and three AT&amp;T 9308S [[digital signal processor|DSP]]s.

Production models use two [[PowerPC 600#PowerPC 603|PowerPC 603]] [[Central processing unit|processors]] running at 66 or 133 [[Hertz|MHz]] to power the BeBox. Prototypes having dual 200&amp;nbsp;MHz CPUs or four CPUs exist, but these were never publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bebox.nu/news.php?lookat=65] Interview with Joseph Palmer&lt;/ref&gt;

== I/O board ==
{{prose|section|date=April 2013}}
[[File:BeBox.Le dos.jpg|thumb|connectors of the I/O board]]
* Four serial ports (9-pin D-shell)
* One mouse port, PS/2-type
* Two joystick ports (15-pin D-shell)
* Two MIDI out ports
* Two MIDI in ports
* Three infrared (IR) I/O ports (6-pin mini DIN)
* One internal CD audio line-level input (5-pin strip)
* One internal microphone audio input (4-pin strip)
* One internal headphone audio output (4-pin strip)
* Two line-level RCA inputs (L/R)
* Two line-level outputs (L/R)
* One microphone input 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm stereo phono jack
* One headphone output 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm stereo phono jack
* A 16-bit stereo sound system @ 48 and 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz
* One &quot;GeekPort&quot; (37-pin D-shell)
** An experimental-electronic-development oriented port, backed by three fuses on the mainboard.
** Digital and analog [[Input/output|I/O]] and [[Direct current|DC power]] connector, 37-pin connector on the [[ISA bus]].
** Two independent, bidirectional 8-bit ports
** Four A/D pins routing to a 12-bit [[Analog-to-digital converter|A/D converter]]
** Four D/A pins connected to an independent 8-bit [[Digital-to-analog converter|D/A converter]]
** Two signal [[ground (electricity)|ground]] reference pins
** Eleven power and ground pins:
*** Two at +5 V, one at +12 V, one at -12 V, seven ground pins.

== &quot;Blinkenlights&quot; ==

Two yellow/green vertical LED arrays, dubbed the &quot;[[blinkenlights]]&quot;, are built into the front bezel to illustrate the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] load. The bottommost LED on the right side indicates hard disk activity.
