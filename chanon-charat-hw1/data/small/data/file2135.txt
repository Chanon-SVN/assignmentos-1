Brussels is just a few miles north of the boundary between Belgium's language communities—French in the south, Dutch in the North.  Historically a Dutch-speaking city, it has seen a [[Francisation of Brussels|major shift to French]] since Belgian independence in 1830. Today, although the majority language is [[French language|French]], the city is officially [[bilingual]]. All [[road sign]]s, street names, and many advertisements and services are shown in both languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hughes |first=Dominic |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7507506.stm |title=Europe &amp;#124; Analysis: Where now for Belgium? |publisher=BBC News |date=15 July 2008 |accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brussels is increasingly becoming multilingual with increasing numbers of migrants, expatriates and minority groups speaking their own languages.

==History==
{{further2|[[Fortifications of Brussels]]|[[Belgian Revolution]]|[[Francization of Brussels]]|[[Brussels and the European Union#History]]|[[Timeline of Brussels]]}}
[[File:Charles de France fondateur de Bruxelles 976 MOD.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine|Charles of Lorraine]] founded what would become Brussels {{circa}} 979]]
The most common theory of the origin of Brussels' name is that it derives from the [[Old Dutch]] ''Broekzele'' or ''Broeksel'', meaning marsh (''broek'') and home (''zele'' / ''sel'') or &quot;home in the marsh&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geert van Istendael]] ''Arm Brussel'', uitgeverij Atlas, ISBN 90-450-0853-X&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the settlement that was to become Brussels lies in [[Gaugericus|Saint Gaugericus]]' construction of a chapel on [[Saint Gaugericus Island|an island]] in the river [[Zenne|Senne]] around 580.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/world-cities/Brussels-History.html |title=Brussels History |publisher=City-data.com |date= |accessdate=5 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Vindicianus]], the bishop of Cambrai made the first recorded reference to the place &quot;Brosella&quot; in 695&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nouvelles archives historiques, philosophiques, et littéraires|volume=1 |last=Jean Baptiste D'Hane, François Huet, P.A.

The official founding of Brussels is usually situated around 979, when [[Charles, Duke of Lower Lotharingia|Duke Charles of Lower Lotharingia]] transferred the relics of Saint [[Gudula]] from [[Moorsel]] to the Saint Gaugericus chapel. Charles would construct the first permanent fortification in the city, doing so on that same island.

[[Lambert I of Leuven]], [[Counts of Leuven|Count of Leuven]] gained the County of Brussels around 1000 by marrying Charles' daughter. Because of its location on the shores of the [[Zenne|Senne]] on an important trade route between [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent]], and [[Cologne]], Brussels grew quite quickly; it became a commercial centre that rapidly extended towards the upper town ([[St. Michael and Gudula Cathedral]], [[Coudenberg]], [[Sablon (Brussels)|Sablon]] area), where there was a smaller risk of floods. As it grew to a population of around 30,000, the surrounding marshes were drained to allow for further expansion. The Counts of Leuven became [[Duke of Brabant|Dukes of Brabant]] at about this time (1183/1184). In the 13th century, the city got [[Fortifications of Brussels|its first walls]].&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.bop.vgc.be/didmat/ogenblikken/achtergrond/ontstaan.html Zo ontstond Brussel] Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie – Commission of the Flemish Community in Brussels&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Grand- Place BXL1695 -01.jpg|thumb|Grand Place after [[Bombardment of Brussels|the 1695 bombardment]] by the French army]]

After the construction of the city walls in the early 13th century, Brussels grew significantly. To let the city expand, [[second walls of Brussels|a second set of walls]] was erected between 1356 and 1383. Today, traces of it can still be seen, mostly because the &quot;[[small ring]]&quot;, a series of roadways in downtown Brussels bounding the historic city centre, follows its former course.

In the 15th century, by means of the wedding of heiress [[Margaret III of Flanders]] with [[Philip II, Duke of Burgundy|Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy]], a new Duke of Brabant emerged from the House of [[Valois Dynasty|Valois]] (namely [[Antoine, Duke of Brabant|Antoine]], their son), with another line of descent from the Habsburgs (Maximilian of Austria, later [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], married [[Mary of Burgundy]], who was born in Brussels). Brabant had lost its independence, but Brussels became the Princely Capital of the prosperous [[Low Countries]], and flourished.

In 1516 [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], who had been heir of the Low Countries since 1506, was declared King of Spain in [[St. Michael and St. Gudula Cathedral]] in Brussels. Upon the death of his grandfather, [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]] in 1519, Charles became the new ruler of the [[Habsburg Empire]] and was subsequently elected the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. It was in [[Coudenberg|the Palace complex at Coudenberg]] that Charles V abdicated in 1555. This impressive palace, famous all over Europe, had greatly expanded since it had first become the seat of the Dukes of Brabant, but it was destroyed by fire in 1731.

In 1695, King [[Louis XIV]] of France sent troops to [[bombardment of Brussels|bombard Brussels with artillery]]. Together with the resulting fire, it was the most destructive event in the entire history of Brussels. The [[Grand Place]] was destroyed, along with 4000 buildings, a third of those in the city. The reconstruction of [[pentagon (Brussels)|the city centre]], effected during subsequent years, profoundly changed the appearance of the city and left numerous traces still visible today. The city [[Siege of Brussels|was captured]] by France in 1746 during the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] but was handed back to Austria three years later.

Brussels remained with Austria until 1795, when the Southern Netherlands was captured and annexed by France. Brussels became the capital of the [[Dyle (department)|department of the Dyle]]. It remained a part of France until 1815, when it joined the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. The former Dyle department became the province of South Brabant, with Brussels as its capital.

[[File:Wappers - Episodes from September Days 1830 on the Place de l’Hôtel de Ville in Brussels.JPG|thumb|left|''Episode of the [[Belgian Revolution]] of 1830'', [[Egide Charles Gustave Wappers|Wappers]] (1834)]]

In 1830, the [[Belgian revolution]] took place in Brussels after a performance of [[Daniel-Francois-Esprit Auber|Auber's]] opera ''[[La Muette de Portici]]'' at the [[La Monnaie]] theatre. Brussels became the capital and seat of government of the new nation. South Brabant was renamed simply [[Province of Brabant|Brabant]], with Brussels as its capital. On 21 July 1831, [[Leopold I of Belgium|Leopold I]], the first King of the Belgians, ascended the throne, undertaking the destruction of the city walls and the construction of many buildings. Following independence, the city underwent many more changes. The [[Senne]] had become a serious [[health hazard]], and from 1867 to 1871 its entire course through the urban area was [[covering of the Senne|completely covered over]]. This allowed [[urban renewal]] and the construction of modern buildings and boulevards characteristic of downtown Brussels today.

[[File:Solvay conference 1927.jpg|thumb|The 1927 [[Solvay Conference]] in Brussels was the fifth world physics conference.]]

Throughout this time, Brussels remained mostly a Dutch-speaking city, though until 1921 French was the sole language of administration. However, in 1921, Belgium was formally split into three language regions—Dutch-speaking [[Flanders]], French-speaking [[Wallonia]] and bilingual Brussels. During the 20th century the city has hosted various fairs and conferences, including the fifth [[Solvay Conference]] in 1927 and two world fairs: the [[Brussels International Exposition (1935)|Brussels International Exposition of 1935]] and the [[Expo '58]]. During [[World War I]], Brussels was an occupied city, but German troops did not cause much damage. In [[World War II]] the city was again occupied, and was spared major damage during its occupation by German forces before it was liberated by the British [[Guards Armoured Division]]. The [[Brussels Airport]] dates to the occupation.

After the war, Brussels was modernized for better and for worse. The construction of the [[North–South connection]] linking the main railway stations in the city was completed in 1952, while the first [[Brussels premetro]] was finished in 1969, and the first line of the [[Brussels Metro]] was opened in 1976. Starting from the early 1960s, Brussels became the ''de facto'' capital of what would become the [[European Union]], and many modern buildings were built. Unfortunately, development was allowed to proceed with little regard to the aesthetics of newer buildings, and many architectural gems were demolished to make way for newer buildings that often clashed with their surroundings, a process known as ''[[Brusselization]]''.

The Brussels-Capital Region was formed on 18 June 1989 after a constitutional reform in 1988. It has bilingual status and it is one of the three [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|federal regions of Belgium]], along with [[Flanders]] and [[Wallonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Belgian Constitution&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CIRB-creation&quot; /&gt;

The 19 [[Municipalities of Belgium|municipalities]] (communes) of the Brussels-Capital [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium#Regions|Region]] are political subdivisions with individual responsibilities for the handling of local level duties, such as law enforcement and the upkeep of schools and roads within its borders.&lt;ref name=&quot;list&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bruxelles.irisnet.be/en/region/region_de_bruxelles-capitale/communes.shtml|title=Communes|year=2004|publisher=Centre d'Informatique pour la Région Bruxelloise |accessdate=4 August 2008|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20040606023552/http://www.bruxelles.irisnet.be/en/region/region_de_bruxelles-capitale/communes.shtml|archivedate=6 June 2004}}{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OECD&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/10/43/1902434.pdf|title=Managing across levels of government|year=1997|publisher=OECD|pages=107, 110|format=PDF|accessdate=5 August 2008}}{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Municipal administration is also conducted by a mayor, a council, and an executive.&lt;ref name=&quot;OECD&quot; /&gt;

In 1831, Belgium was divided into 2,739 municipalities, including the 19 in the Brussels-Capital Region.&lt;ref name=&quot;roots&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belgium.rootsweb.ancestry.com/bel/_places/bel_places.html|title=Municipalities (1795-now)|last=Picavet|first=Georges|date=29 April 2003|publisher=Georges Picavet|accessdate=4 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most of the municipalities in Belgium, the ones located in the Brussels-Capital Region were not merged with others during mergers occurring in 1964, 1970, and 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;roots&quot; /&gt; However, several municipalities outside of the Brussels-Capital Region have been merged with the [[City of Brussels]] throughout its history including [[Laeken]], [[Haren, Belgium|Haren]], and [[Neder-Over-Heembeek]], which were merged into the City of Brussels in 1921.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brussels&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belgium.rootsweb.ancestry.com/bel/2bru/index.html|title=Brussels Capital-Region|date=4 June 2005 |publisher=Georges Picavet |accessdate=4 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest and most populous of the municipalities is the City of Brussels, covering {{convert|32.6|km2|sqmi|1}} with 145,917 inhabitants. The least populous is [[Koekelberg]] with 18,541 inhabitants, while the smallest in area is [[Saint-Josse-ten-Noode]], which is only {{convert|1.1|km2|sqmi|1}}. Despite being the smallest municipality, Saint-Josse-ten-Noode has the highest population density of the 19 with 20,822 inhabitants per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Climate==
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Brussels experiences an [[oceanic climate]] (Cfb). Brussels' proximity to coastal areas influences the area's climate by sending marine air masses from the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Nearby wetlands also ensure a maritime temperate climate. On average (based on measurements over the last 100 years), there are approximately 200 days of rain per year in the Brussels-Capital Region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meteo.be/meteo/view/fr/360361-Parametres.html#ppt_757427 |title=Site de l'institut météorologique belge |publisher=Meteo.be |date= |accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snowfall is infrequent, averaging 24 days per year.

==Government==
{{Main|Government of the Brussels-Capital Region}}
[[File:Charles Picqué.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Charles Picqué]] was [[Minister-President of the Brussels-Capital Region]] in 1989 and again from 2004 until 2013.]]
[[File:Palais de la Nation, Bruxelles.jpg|thumb|[[Palace of the Nation]], seat of the [[Belgian Federal Parliament]].]]
The Brussels-Capital Region is one of the three [[Communities and regions of Belgium|regions]] of [[Belgium]], while the [[French Community of Belgium]] and the [[Flemish Community]] do exercise, each for their part, their cultural powers on the territory of the Region. French and Dutch are the official languages; most public services are bilingual (exceptions being education and a couple of others). The Capital Region is predominantly French-speaking—about 60–85%&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.lexilogos.com/bruxelles_plan.htm Personal website ''Lexilogos'' located in the [[Provence]], on European Languages (English, French, German, Dutch, and so on) – French-speakers in Brussels are estimated at about 90% (estimation, not an 'official' number because there are no linguistic census in Belgium)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{Wayback |date=20070303005845 |url=http://www.initiatives.refer.org/_notes/sess604.htm#_ftnref9 |title=''Langues majoritaires, langues minoritaires, dialectes et NTIC'' by Simon Petermann, Professor at the University of Liège, Wallonia, Belgium }}{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;E. Corijn&quot;&gt;Flemish Academic E. Corijn, at a Colloquium regarding Brussels, on 5 December 2001, states that in Brussels there is 91% of the population speaking French at home, either alone or with another language, and there is about 20% speaking Dutch at home, either alone (9%) or with French (11%) – After ponderation, the repartition can be estimated at between 85 and 90% French-speaking, and the remaining are Dutch-speaking, corresponding to the estimations based on languages chosen in Brussels by citizens for their official documents (ID, driving licenses, weddings, birth, death, and so on) ; all these statistics on language are also available at Belgian Department of Justice (for weddings, birth, death), Department of Transport (for Driving licenses), Department of Interior (for IDs), because there are no means to know ''precisely'' the proportions since Belgium has abolished 'official' linguistic censuses, thus official documents on language choices can only be estimations.&lt;/ref&gt; of the population are French-speakers (including migrants and second language speakers), and about 10–15%&lt;ref name=&quot;E.

In January 2006, of its registered inhabitants, 73.1% are Belgian nationals, 4.1% French nationals, 12.0% other EU nationals (usually expressing themselves in either French or English), 4.0% [[Morocco|Moroccan]] nationals, and 6.8% other non-EU nationals.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bruxelles.irisnet.be/brussels?set_language=en&amp;uri=ff80818115f323cb0115f659b6880039 |title=IS 2007 – Population (Tableaux) |publisher=Bruxelles.irisnet.be |date= |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutions===
Because of how the federalisation was handled in Belgium, but also because the municipalities in the region did not take part in the merger that affected municipalities in the rest of Belgium in the seventies, the public institutions in Brussels offer a bewildering complexity. The complexity is more apparent in the lawbooks than in the facts, since the members of the Brussels Parliament and Government also act in other capacities, for example, as members of the council of the Brussels agglomeration or the community commissions.
One distinguishes:

====Parliament====
{{Main|Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region}}
[[File:Parlement Région Bruxelles.JPG|thumb|[[Brussels Parliament building]]]]
The region is governed by a parliament of 89 members (72 French-speaking, 17 Dutch-speaking, parties are organised on a linguistic basis) and an eight-member regional cabinet consisting of a minister-president, four ministers and three state secretaries.  By law, the cabinet must comprise two French-speaking and two Dutch-speaking ministers, one Dutch-speaking secretary of state and two French-speaking secretaries of state.  The minister-president does not count against the language quota, but in practice every minister-president has been a bilingual francophone.  The regional parliament can enact ordinances (French: ''ordonnances'', Dutch: ''ordonnanties''), which have equal status as a national legislative act.

* The agglomeration, with a council and a board, with the same membership as the organs of the Brussels Region. This is a decentralised administrative public body, assuming jurisdiction over areas that elsewhere in Belgium are exercised by municipalities or provinces (fire brigade, waste disposal). The by-laws enacted by it do not have the status of a legislative act.

* A bi-communitarian public authority, [[Common Community Commission]] (French: ''Commission communautaire commune, COCOM'', Dutch: ''Gemeenschappelijke Gemeenschapscommissie, GGC''), with a United Assembly (i.e. the members of the regional parliament) and a United Board (the ministers—not the secretaries of state—of the region, with the minister-president not having the right to vote). This Commission has two capacities: it is a decentralised administrative public body, responsible for implementing cultural policies of common interest. It can give subsidies and enact by-laws. In another capacity it can also enact ordinances, which have equal status as a national legislative act, in the field of the welfare powers of the communities: in the Brussels-Capital Region, both the French Community and the Flemish Community can exercise powers in the field of welfare, but only in regard to institutions that are unilingual (for example, a private French-speaking retirement home or the Dutch-speaking hospital of the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]). The Common Community Commission is responsible for policies aiming directly at private persons or at bilingual institutions (for example, the centra for social welfare of the 19 municipalities). Its ordinances have to be enacted with a majority in both linguistic groups. Failing such a majority, a new vote can be held, where a majority of at least one third in each linguistic group is sufficient.

* The Brussels Region is the only one that is not subdivided into provinces, nor is it a province itself. Within the Region, 99% of the areas of provincial jurisdiction are assumed by the Brussels regional institutions. Remaining is only the [[governor of Brussels-Capital]] and some aides.  Its status is roughly akin to that of a [[federal district]].

* 6 inter-municipal policing zones

* intercommunal societies created freely by the municipalities

Also the federal state, the French Community and the Flemish Community exercise their jurisdiction on the territory of the region. 19 of the 72 French-speaking members of the Brussels Parliament are also members of the [[Parliament of the French Community of Belgium]], and until 2004 this was also the case for six Dutch-speaking members, who were at the same time members of the [[Flemish Parliament]]. Now, people voting for a Flemish party have to vote separately for 6 directly elected members of the Flemish Parliament.

Due to the multiple capacities of single members of parliament, there are parliamentarians who are at the same time members of the Brussels Parliament, members of the Assembly of the Common Community Commission, members of the Assembly of the French Community Commission, members of the Parliament of the French Community of Belgium and &quot;community senators&quot; in the [[Belgian Senate]]. At the moment, this is the case for Mr. François Roelants du Vivier (for the [[Mouvement Réformateur]]), Mrs. {{Ill|fr|Amina Derbaki Sbaï}} (since June 2004 for the [[Parti Socialiste (Belgium)|Parti Socialiste]], but beforehand, since 2003, for the Mouvement Réformateur) and Mrs [[Sfia Bouarfa]] (since 2001 for the Parti Socialiste).

==In Belgian politics==
[[File:Palace of Brussels.jpg|thumb|The [[Royal Palace of Brussels]]]]

Despite what its name suggests, the Brussels-Capital Region is not the capital of [[Belgium]] in itself. Article 194 of the [[Belgian Constitution]] establishes that the capital of Belgium is the [[City of Brussels]], a smaller municipality within the capital region that once was the city's core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fed-parl.be/gwuk0015.htm#E11E15 |title=Title VII |publisher=Fed-parl.be |date= |accessdate=5 July 2009|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/19980525055113/http://www.fed-parl.be/gwuk0015.htm|archivedate=25 May 1998}}{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, although the City of Brussels is the official capital, the funds allotted by the federation and region for the representative role of the capital are divided among the 19 municipalities, and some national institutions are sited in the other 18 municipalities. Thus, while only the City of Brussels itself officially carries the title of capital of Belgium, in practice the entire capital region plays this role, and the national institutions of the Belgian state are spread loosely around the region.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} A lot of controversy exists concerning the division of 19 municipalities for a highly urbanized region which is considered as one city by most people. Most French-speaking politicians want the 19 municipalities to stay. Flemish politicians want to abolish the so-called '19 baronies' in favour of one city council and one mayor, change the current municipalities into districts (like [[Antwerp]]), boroughs (like [[London]]) or arrondissements (like [[Paris]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vub.ac.be/home/academischeopening/archief/0506/Bruxellesvautbienunemesse.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seat of the French Community and Flemish Community==
The Brussels-Capital Region is one of the three federated regions of Belgium, alongside [[Wallonia]] and the [[Flemish Region]]. Geographically and linguistically, it is a bilingual [[enclave]] in the unilingual Flemish Region. Regions are one component of Belgium's institutions, the three communities being the other component: Brussels' inhabitants deal with either the [[French Community of Belgium|French (speaking) Community]] or the [[Flemish Community]] for matters such as culture and education.&lt;ref name=comm/&gt;

Brussels is also the capital of both the [[French Community of Belgium]] (''Communauté française de Belgique'' in French) and of [[Flanders]]; all Flemish capital institutions are established here: [[Flemish Parliament]], [[Flemish Government]] and its administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brussels, the capital of Flanders|url=http://www.flanders.be/servlet/Satellite?c=Page&amp;cid=1166590837731&amp;context=1166590833692--EN&amp;p=1166590837731&amp;pagename=flanders_site%2FView|publisher=Flemish Department of Foreign Affairs|accessdate=6 November 2009|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20110610162638/http://www.flanders.be/servlet/Satellite?c=Page&amp;cid=1166590837731&amp;context=1166590833692--EN&amp;p=1166590837731&amp;pagename=flanders_site%2FView|archivedate=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 2 community-specific public authorities, [[French Community Commission]] (French: ''Commission communautaire française or COCOF'') and the [[Flemish Community Commission]] (Dutch: ''Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie, VGC'') for the Flemings in Brussels, with an assembly (i.e. the members of parliament of the linguistic group) and a board (the ministers and secretaries of state of the linguistic group). These commissions implement policies of the French Community and the Flemish Community in the Brussels-Capital Region.&lt;ref name=comm&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.vgc.be/ VGC] {{fr icon}} [http://www.cocof.irisnet.be/site/fr/organisation/competences_htm COCOF]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The French Community Commission has also another capacity: some legislative powers of the French Community have been devolved to the Walloon Region (for the French language area of Belgium) and to the French Community Commission (for the bilingual language area).&lt;ref&gt;Procedure contained in art. 138 of the Belgian Constitution&lt;/ref&gt; The Flemish Community, however, did the opposite; it merged the Flemish Region into the Flemish Community.&lt;ref&gt;Procedure in art. 137 of the Belgian Constitution&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to different conceptions in the two communities, one focusing more on the Communities and the other more on the Regions, causing an asymmetrical federalism. Because of this devolution, the French Community Commission can enact [[decree]]s, which are legislative acts.

==In international politics==
Brussels has, since [[World War II]], become the administrative centre of many international organizations. The European Union (EU) and the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) have their main institutions in the city, along with many other international organisations such as the [[World Customs Organization]] and [[EUROCONTROL]] as well as international corporations. Brussels is third in the number of international conferences it hosts&lt;ref name=&quot;ULB Int&quot;&gt;[http://www.ulb.ac.be/docs/ulb-prestige/bxluk.html Brussels, an international city and European capital]{{Dead link|date=February 2012}} Université Libre de Bruxelles&lt;/ref&gt; also becoming one of the largest convention centres in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;diplomatie&quot;&gt;[http://www.diplomatie.be/EN/belgium/belgiumdetail.asp?TEXTID=1754 Brussels: home to international organisations] diplomatie.be&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of the EU and the other international bodies has, for example, led to there being more ambassadors and journalists in Brussels than in Washington D.C.&lt;ref name=&quot;E!Sarp&quot;&gt;E!Sharp magazine, January–February 2007 issue: Article &quot;A tale of two cities&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; International schools have also been established to serve this presence.&lt;ref name=&quot;diplomatie&quot;/&gt; The &quot;international community&quot; in Brussels numbers at least 70,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew Rettman |url=http://euobserver.com/9/29622 |title=Euobserver.com |publisher=Euobserver.com |date= |accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, there were an estimated 286 lobbying consultancies known to work in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Leigh Phillips |url=http://euobserver.com/9/29658 |title=Euobserver.com |publisher=Euobserver.com |date= |accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==

===Nationalities===
Brussels is home to a large number of immigrants. At the last Belgian census in 1991, 63.7% of inhabitants in Brussels-Capital Region answered that they were Belgian citizens, born as such in Belgium. However, there have been numerous individual or familial migrations towards Brussels since the end of the 18th century, including political refugees ([[Karl Marx]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Pierre Joseph Proudhon]], [[Léon Daudet]] for example,) from neighbouring or more distanced countries as well as labour migrants, former foreign students or expatriates, and many Belgian families in Brussels can claim at least one foreign grandparent.

In general the population of Brussels is younger than the national average and the gap between rich and poor is wider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lalibre.be/actu/bruxelles/article/616278/tres-riches-et-tres-pauvres.html |title=Très riches et très pauvres |publisher=Lalibre.be |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brussels has a large concentration of immigrants and their children from other countries, including many of Turkish and Moroccan ancestry, together with French-speaking black Africans from [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]].

People of foreign origin make up nearly 70%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npdata.be/Data/Vreemdelingen/Vreemde-afkomst/1990-2008/tabellen/Portaal/index.html |title=Non-Profit Data |publisher=Npdata.be |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the population of Brussels, most of whom have been naturalized following the great 1991 reform of the naturalization process. 32% of the inhabitants are of foreign [[Europe]]an origin, and 36% are of another background, mostly from [[Morocco]], [[Turkey]] and Sub-Saharan [[Africa]]. Among all major migrant groups from outside the EU, a majority of the permanent residents have acquired Belgian nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npdata.be/BuG/155-Vreemde-afkomst/Vreemde-afkomst.htm |title=Vreemde afkomst 01/01/2012 |publisher=Npdata.be |date= |accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religions===
[[File:Schaarbeek - St Maria.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[St. Mary's Royal Church]], a 19th-century [[Roman Catholic]] church in Brussels.]]
Although historically Roman Catholic majority, after the expulsion of Protestants in the 16th century, most today are non-practicing, with about 10% of the Catholic population regularly attends church services. Brussels has a growing [[Muslims]] community, [[atheism|atheists]] and [[agnosticism|agnostics]]. Other recognized religions Protestantism, [[Anglicanism]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodoxy]] and [[Judaism]], are practiced by much smaller groups in Brussels.

Recognized religions and ''[[Laïcité]]'' enjoy public funding and school courses: every pupil in an official school from 6 years old to 18 must choose 2 hours per week of compulsory religion—or ''Laïcité''—inspired morals.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=August 2012}}

Brussels has a large concentration of [[Islam in Belgium|Muslims]], mostly of Turkish and Moroccan ancestry. Belgium does not collect statistics by ethnic background, so exact figures are unknown. It is estimated that people of Muslim background account for 25.5% of Brussels' population, a much higher concentration than those of the other regions of Belgium.&lt;ref name=&quot;BuG 100&quot;&gt;[http://www.npdata.be/BuG/100/ &quot;In België wonen 628.751 moslims(*), 6,0% van de bevolking.

Since the founding of the [[Kingdom of Belgium]] in 1830, Brussels has transformed from being almost entirely [[Dutch language|Dutch-speaking]] ([[Brabantian]] dialect to be exact), to being a multilingual city with French (specifically [[Belgian French]]) as the majority language and [[lingua franca]]. This language shift, the [[Francization of Brussels]], is rooted in the 18th century and accelerated after [[Belgium]] became [[Belgian revolution|independent]] and Brussels expanded past its original boundaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;service&quot;&gt;{{cite web |language=French |url=http://www2.cfwb.be/franca/services/pg027.htm |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20070105023238/http://www.cfwb.be/franca/services/pg027.htm |archivedate=5 January 2007 |title= Wallonie – Bruxelles, Le Service de la langue française |date=19 May 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;laval&quot;&gt;{{cite web |language=French  |url=http://www.ulaval.ca/afi/colloques/colloque2001/actes/textes/tourret.htm |title=Villes, identités et médias francophones: regards croisés Belgique, Suisse, Canada |publisher=[[University of Laval]], Quebec |accessdate=22 July 2009}}{{Dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French-speaking immigration contributed to the Frenchification of Brussels; both Walloons and expatriates from other countries, mainly France, came to Brussels in great numbers. However, a more important cause for the Frenchification was the language change over several generations from Dutch to French that was performed in Brussels by the [[Flemish people]] themselves. The main reason for this was the political, administrative and social pressure, partly based on the low social prestige of the Dutch language in Belgium at the time; this made French the only language of administration, law, politics and education in Belgium and thus necessary for social mobility.&lt;ref name=&quot;nlb&quot;&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/toor004gesc01_01/toor004gesc01_01_0029.htm |title=Nederlands in België, Het Nederlands bedreigd en overlevend |author=G.

Halfway through the 20th century the number of monolingual French-speakers surpassed the number of mostly bilingual Flemish inhabitants.&lt;ref name=&quot;brio4&quot;&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.briobrussel.be/assets/andere%20publicaties/btng-rbhc,%2021,%201990,%203-4,%20pp%20383-412.pdf &quot;Thuis in gescheiden werelden&quot; – De migratoire en sociale aspecten van verfransing te Brussel in het midden van de 19e eeuw&quot;], BTNG-RBHC, XXI, 1990, 3–4, pp. 383–412, Machteld de Metsenaere, Eerst aanwezend assistent en docent Vrije Universiteit Brussel&lt;/ref&gt;

Only since the 1960s, after the fixation of the Belgian [[Communities, regions and language areas of Belgium|language border]], and after the socio-economic development of Flanders was in full effect, could Dutch stem the tide of increasing French use.&lt;ref name=&quot;dbnl&quot;&gt;{{cite web |language=Dutch |url=http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_han001197301_01/_han001197301_01_0009.htm |title=De historische kracht van de Vlaamse beweging in België: de doelstellingen van gister, de verwezenlijkingen vandaag en de culturele aspiraties voor morgen |author=J.

Given its Dutch-speaking origins and the role that Brussels plays as the capital city in a bilingual country, the administration of the entire Brussels-Capital Region is in theory fully bilingual, including its subdivisions and public services. Nevertheless, some communautarian issues remain. Flemish political parties demanded for decades that the Flemish part of [[Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde]] arrondissement be separated from the Brussels Region. The French-speaking population regards the language border as artificial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=French |url=http://www.lalibre.be/article.phtml?id=10&amp;subid=90&amp;art_id=283113 |title=La Flandre ne prendra pas Bruxelles... |publisher=La Libre Belgique |date=28 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and demands the extension of the bilingual region to at least all six [[municipalities with language facilities]] in the surroundings of Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;The six municipalities with language facilities around Brussels are [[Wemmel]], [[Kraainem]], [[Wezembeek-Oppem]], [[Sint-Genesius-Rode]], [[Linkebeek]] and [[Drogenbos]].&lt;/ref&gt; Flemish politicians have strongly rejected these proposals.&lt;ref name=&quot;question&quot;&gt;{{cite web |language=French |url=http://www.lalibre.be/article.phtml?id=10&amp;subid=90&amp;art_id=202792 |title=Une question: partir ou rester? |publisher=[[La Libre Belgique]] |date=24 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=French |url=http://www.uniondesfrancophones.be/ |title=Position commune des partis démocratiques francophones |publisher=[[Union des Francophones]] (UF), Province of [[Flemish Brabant]] |accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |language=French |url=http://info.france2.fr/dossiers/europe/34025346-fr.php?page=7 |title=Bruxelles-capitale: une forte identité |publisher=[[France 2]] |date=14 November 2007 |accessdate=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; BHV was divided mid 2012.

The original Dutch dialect of Brussels (''Brussels'') is a form of [[Brabantic]] (the variant of Dutch spoken in the ancient [[Duchy of Brabant]]) with a significant number of loanwords from French, and still survives among a minority of inhabitants called ''Brusseleers'', many of them quite bi- and multilingual, or educated in French and not writing the Dutch language. Brussels and its suburbs evolved from a Dutch-dialect–speaking town to a mainly French-speaking town. The ethnic and national self-identification of the inhabitants is quite different along ethnic lines.

For their French-speaking ''Bruxellois'', it can vary from Belgian, Francophone Belgian, ''Bruxellois'' (like the Memellanders in interwar ethnic censuses in [[Klaipėda|Memel]]), [[Walloons|Walloon]] (for people who migrated from the Wallonia Region at an adult age); for Flemings living in Brussels it is mainly either Flemish or ''Brusselaar'' (Dutch for an inhabitant) and often both. For the ''Brusseleers'', many simply consider themselves as belonging to Brussels. For the many rather recent immigrants from other countries, the identification also includes all the national origins: people tend to call themselves Moroccans or Turks rather than an American-style hyphenated version.

The two largest foreign groups come from two [[Francophonie|francophone]] countries: France and [[Morocco]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The first language of roughly half of the inhabitants is not an official one of the Capital Region.&lt;ref name=standaard&gt;{{cite journal|title=Van autochtoon naar allochtoon|quote=''Meer dan de helft van de Brusselse bevolking is van vreemde afkomst.

In recent decades, owing to migration and the city's international role, Brussels is home to a growing number of foreign language speakers. In 2013, figures cited in the Marnix Plan show that 63.2% of Brussels inhabitants are native speakers of French, while less than 20% are native Dutch speakers. Just 2.5% speak English as their mother tongue, but 29.7% of people living in the city claim to speak English well or very well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.euractiv.com/culture/flemish-education-minister-engli-news-531233 |title=English should be Brussels' official language, Flemish minister says |publisher=EurActiv |date= |accessdate=2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The migrant communities, as well as rapidly growing communities of EU-nationals from other EU-member states, speak many languages like French, [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Arabic languages|Arabic]], [[Berber languages|Berber]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[German language|German]], and (increasingly) [[English language|English]]. The degree of linguistic integration varies widely within each migrant group.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Atomium FlickR ctsnow.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Atomium]] ]] --&gt;
[[File:Brussels Zonienwoud.jpg|thumb|[[Sonian Forest]] at the outskirts of Brussels]]
The architecture in Brussels is diverse, and spans from the medieval constructions on the [[Grand Place]] to the [[postmodernism|postmodern]] buildings of the [[Brussels and the European Union|EU institutions]].

Main attractions include the [[Grand Place]], since 1998 a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]], with the Gothic town hall in the old centre, the [[St. Michael and Gudula Cathedral]] and the [[Royal Palace of Laeken]] with its large greenhouses. Another famous landmark is the [[Royal Palace of Brussels|Royal Palace]].

The [[Atomium]] is a symbolic {{convert|103|m|ft|0|sing=on}} tall structure that was built for the [[Expo '58|1958 World's Fair]]. It consists of nine steel spheres connected by tubes, and forms a model of an iron crystal (specifically, a [[unit cell]]). The architect A. Waterkeyn devoted the building to science. Next to the Atomium is the [[Mini-Europe]] park with 1:25 scale [[maquette]]s of famous buildings from across Europe.

The [[Manneken Pis]], a fountain containing a bronze sculpture of a urinating youth, is a tourist attraction and symbol of the city.

Other landmarks include the [[Cinquantenaire|Cinquantenaire park]] with its triumphal arch and nearby museums, the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Belgium|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]], [[Brussels Stock Exchange]], the [[Law Courts of Brussels|Palace of Justice]] and the buildings of EU institutions in the [[Brussels and the European Union|European Quarter]].

[[File:Cinquantenaire.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cinquantenaire]] triumphal arch]]

Cultural facilities include the Brussels Theatre and the [[La Monnaie]] Theatre and opera house. There is a wide array of museums, from the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|Royal Museums of Fine Arts]] to the [[Royal Museum of the Armed Forces and of Military History|Museum of the Army]] and the [[Centre Belge de la Bande Dessinée|Comic Museum]]. Brussels also has a lively music scene, with everything from opera houses and concert halls to music bars and techno clubs.

The city centre is notable for its Flemish town houses. Also particularly striking are the buildings in the [[Art Nouveau]] style by the Brussels architect [[Victor Horta]]. Some of Brussels' districts were developed during the heyday of Art Nouveau, and many buildings are in this style. Good examples include [[Schaerbeek]], [[Etterbeek]], [[Ixelles]], and [[Saint-Gilles, Belgium|Saint-Gilles]]. Another example of Brussels Art Nouveau is the [[Stoclet Palace]], by the Viennese architect [[Josef Hoffmann]]. The modern buildings of [[Espace Leopold]] complete the picture.

===Arts===
The city has had a renowned artist scene for many years. The famous Belgian surrealist [[René Magritte]], for instance, studied in Brussels. The city was also home of Impressionist painters like [[Anna Boch]] from the Artist Group [[Les XX]] and include others famous Belgian painters such as Léon Spilliaert &amp; Guy Huygens.
The city is also a capital of the comic strip;&lt;ref name=Comic&gt;{{cite news|last=Herbez|first=Ariel|title=Bruxelles, capitale de la BD|url=http://www.letemps.ch/Page/Uuid/73a8ca52-4c90-11de-8192-71ce8207b7fa|accessdate=28 May 2010|newspaper=Le Temps|date=30 May 2009|location=Switzerland|language=French|quote=Plus que jamais, Bruxelles mérite son statut de capitale de la bande dessinée. }}{{Dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; some treasured Belgian characters are [[The Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]], [[Lucky Luke]], [[Cubitus]], [[Gaston (comics)|Gaston]] and [[Marsupilami]]. Throughout the city, walls are painted with large motifs of comic book characters; these [[mural]]s taken together are known as the [[Brussels' Comic Book Route]]. Also, the interiors of some Metro stations are designed by artists. The [[Belgian Comic Strip Center]] combines two artistic leitmotifs of Brussels, being a museum devoted to Belgian comic strips, housed in the former Waucquez department store, designed by [[Victor Horta]] in the [[Art Nouveau]] style.

Museum Moderne Kunst Brussel. Musée d'art moderne Bruxelles |publisher=Trabel.com |date= |accessdate=5 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]. The museum has an extensive collection of various painters, such as the [[Flemish painting|Flemish painters]] like [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]], [[Rogier van der Weyden]], [[Robert Campin]], [[Anthony van Dyck]], and [[Jacob Jordaens]]. The [[Magritte Museum]] houses the world's largest collection of the works of the surrealist [[René Magritte]]. The [[BELvue Museum]] is dedicated to the national history of Belgium.

Brussels is well known for its performing arts scene, with the [[Kunstenfestivaldesarts]], the [[Kaaitheater]] and [[La Monnaie]] among the most notable institutions. The [[King Baudouin Stadium]] is a concert and competition facility with a 50,000 seat capacity, the largest in Belgium. The site was formerly occupied by the [[Heysel Stadium]]. Furthermore, the Bozar ([[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels|Center for Fine Arts]]) is home to the [[National Orchestra of Belgium]] and the [[Place Flagey|Flagey]] cultural centre hosts the [[Brussels Philharmonic]].

===Cuisine===

The gastronomic offer includes approximately 1,800 restaurants, and a number of high quality bars. Belgian cuisine is known among connoisseurs as one of the best in Europe. In addition to the traditional restaurants, there are a large number of cafés, bistros, and the usual range of international fast food chains. The cafés are similar to bars, and offer beer and light dishes; coffee houses are called the Salons de Thé. Also widespread are ''brasseries'', which usually offer a large number of beers and typical national dishes.

Belgian cuisine is characterised by the combination of [[French cuisine]] with the more hearty Flemish fare. Notable specialities include [[Brussels waffle]]s (gaufres) and [[mussels]] (usually as &quot;[[moules frites]]&quot;, served with fries). The city is a stronghold of chocolate and pralines manufacturers with renowned companies like [[Chocolatier Neuhaus|Neuhaus]], [[Leonidas (chocolate maker)|Leonidas]] and [[Godiva Chocolatier|Godiva]]. Numerous [[friteries]] are spread throughout the city, and in tourist areas, fresh, hot, waffles are also sold on the street.

In addition to the regular selection of [[Belgian beer]], the famous [[lambic]] style of beer is predominately brewed in and around Brussels, and the yeasts have their origin in the [[Senne]] valley. [[Kriek lambic|Kriek]], a cherry lambic, enjoys outstanding popularity, as it does in the rest of Belgium. Kriek is available in almost every bar or restaurant.

==Sports==

Brussels has three major [[association football|football]] clubs. [[R.S.C. Anderlecht]],  based in the [[Anderlecht]] municipality, is the most successful Belgian football in the [[Belgian First Division]] with 31 titles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesb/belgchamp.html Belgium - List of Champions]. Rsssf.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-12.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also won the most major European tournaments for a Belgian side. [[F.C. Molenbeek Brussels Strombeek]], often referred to as FC Brussels and recently rebranded RWDM Brussels FC, is based in the [[Sint-Jans-Molenbeek]] municipality and plays in the [[Belgian Second Division]]. Brussels is also home to [[R.

==Economy==
[[File:Bourse Bxl 01.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Brussels Stock Exchange]]]]
{{Further|Economy of Belgium}}
Serving as the centre of administration for Europe, Brussels' economy is largely service-oriented. It is dominated by regional and world headquarters of multinationals, by European institutions, by various administrations, and by related services, though it does have a number of notable craft industries, such as the [[Cantillon Brewery]], a [[lambic]] brewery founded in 1900.

Brussels has a robust economy. Its [[GDP per capita]] is nearly double that of Belgium as a whole,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gross domestic product per resident, at current prices - Ratio in relation to the total of the Kingdom |url=http://www.nbb.be/belgostat/PublicatieSelectieLinker?LinkID=68000011%7c910000082&amp;Lang=E|publisher=[[National Bank of Belgium]]|accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has the highest GDP per capita of any [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS 1]] region in the European Union at €62,000 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GDP per capita in the EU in 2011: seven capital regions among the ten most prosperous|publisher=Europa web portal|author=Eurostat|date=27 February 2014|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/1-27022014-AP/EN/1-27022014-AP-EN.PDF|accessdate=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; That being said, the GDP is boosted by a massive inflow of commuters from neighbouring regions; over half of those who work in Brussels live in Flanders or Wallonia, with 230,000 and 130,000 commuters per day respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;stat&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aps.vlaanderen.be/statistiek/nieuws/arbeidsmarkt/2007-07-pendel.htm |title=Pendelarbeid tussen de gewesten en provincies in België anno 2006 |year=2007 |work=Vlaamse statistieken, strategisch management en surveyonderzoek |publisher=[[FPS Economy Belgium]] |accessdate=January 17, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080416043857/http://aps.vlaanderen.be/statistiek/nieuws/arbeidsmarkt/2007-07-pendel.htm |archivedate = April 16, 2008|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all of the wealth generated in Brussels remains in Brussels itself, and as of December 2013 the unemployment among residents of Brussels is 20.4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Youth unemployment in Brussels falls under 30%|url=http://www.deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/Economy/140106_Umeployment|publisher=[[Flandersnews.be]]|date=6 January 2014|accessdate=23 April 2014}}{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:ULB 20050712.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]]]]
There are several universities in Brussels. The two main universities are the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles]], a French-speaking university with about 20,000 students in three campuses in the city (and two others outside),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Presentation of the Université libre de Bruxelles|publisher=[[Université Libre de Bruxelles]]|url=http://www.ulb.ac.be/docs/ulb-prestige/indexuk.html|accessdate=9 December 2007}}{{Dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]], a [[Dutch language|Dutch-speaking]] university with about 10,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the University: Culture and History|publisher=[[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]]|url=http://www.vub.ac.be/english/home/about.html|accessdate=9 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both universities originate from a single ancestor university founded in 1834, namely the Free University of Brussels, which was split in 1970 at about the same time the Flemish and French Communities gained legislative power over the organization of higher education.

Other universities include the [[Facultés Universitaires Saint-Louis]] with 2,000 students,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institution: Historique|publisher=Facultés Universitaires Saint Louis|url=http://www.fusl.ac.be/fr/27.html|accessdate=9 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; a campus of the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KU Leuven organisational chart: KU Leuven, Campus Brussels|publisher=Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|url=http://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/en/unit/52230448/@@org|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which offers bachelor &amp; master degrees of the faculties of economics &amp; business, law, arts, architecture. A large research unit of the faculty of economics &amp; business is based in the city centre)  the [[Royal Military Academy (Belgium)|Royal Military Academy]], a military college established in 1834 by a French colonel&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What makes the RMA so special?|publisher=[[Royal Military Academy (Belgium)|Belgian Royal Military Academy]]|url=http://www.rma.ac.be/RMAdotNet/scsc/infos/default.aspx?Page=1&amp;SubPage=3|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20071228233044/http://www.rma.ac.be/RMAdotNet/scsc/infos/default.aspx?Page=1&amp;SubPage=3|archivedate=28 December 2007|accessdate=9 December 2007}}{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two drama schools founded in 1982: the French-speaking [[Conservatoire royal de Bruxelles|Conservatoire Royal]] and the [[Dutch language|Dutch-speaking]] [[Koninklijk Conservatorium (Brussel)|Koninklijk Conservatorium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Petite histoire du Conservatoire royal de Bruxelles|publisher=Conservatoire Royal|url=http://www.conservatoire.be/historique.html|accessdate=9 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Koninklijk Conservatorium Brussel|publisher=[[Koninklijk Conservatorium (Brussel)|Koninklijk Conservatorium]]|url=http://www.kcb.be/eng/indexin.asp?pag=bib&amp;nr=1|accessdate=9 December 2007}}{{Dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still other universities have campuses in Brussels, such as the [[Université Catholique de Louvain]] that has had its medical faculty in the city since 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=L'histoire de l'UCL à Bruxelles|publisher=[[Université Catholique de Louvain]]|url=http://www.uclouvain.be/47547.html|accessdate=9 December 2007}}{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the University of Kent's [[Brussels School of International Studies]] is a specialised postgraduate school offering advanced international studies and [[Boston University Brussels]] was established in 1972 and offers master's degrees in business administration and international relations. Due to the post-war international presence in the city, there are also a number of international schools, including the [[International School of Brussels]] with 1,450 pupils between 2½ and 18,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISB Profile|publisher=[[International School of Brussels]]|url=http://www.isb.be/page.cfm?p=7|accessdate=9 December 2007}}{{dead link|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[British School of Brussels]], and the four [[European School]]s, which provide free education for the children of those working in the [[Institutions of the European Union|EU institutions]]. The combined student population of the four [[European School]]s in Brussels is currently around 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Background |publisher=[[European Schools|Schola Europaea]]|url=http://www.eursc.eu/index.php?id=133|accessdate=9 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear left}}

However, by far most Brussels pupils between 3 and 18 go to schools organized by the [[Flemish Community]] and the [[French-speaking Community]], with roughly 20% going to the first (Flemish) and close to 80% for the French-speaking schools.

[[File:Gare de Bruxelles-Midi Station Brussel-Zuid.jpg|thumb|Waiting room for passengers at [[Brussels-South railway station]]]]
[[File:Ice bruxelles.JPG|thumb|right|High-speed rail networks connect Brussels with other European cities ''(''[[Intercity-Express|ICE]]'' train in the [[Brussels-North railway station|North station]] pictured)'']]

===Air===
Brussels is served by [[Brussels Airport]], located in the nearby Flemish municipality of [[Zaventem]], and by the smaller [[Brussels South Charleroi Airport]], located near [[Charleroi]] (Wallonia), some {{convert|50|km|mi|-1|abbr=on}} from Brussels.

===Water===
Brussels also has its own port on the [[Brussels-Scheldt Maritime Canal]] located in the northwest of the city. The [[Brussels-Charleroi Canal]] connects Brussels with the industrial areas of [[Wallonia]].

===Train===
The City of Brussels has three main train stations: [[Brussels-South railway station|Brussels South]], [[Brussels-Central railway station|Central]] and [[Brussels-North railway station|North]], which are amongst the busiest of the country. Brussels South is also served by direct high-speed rail links: to London by the [[Eurostar]] train via the Channel Tunnel (1hr 51 min); to Amsterdam by the [[Thalys]] and &quot;InterCity-Plus&quot; connections; to Amsterdam, Paris (1hr 25 min, 3hr 18min) and Cologne by the [[Thalys]]; and to Cologne and Frankfurt by the German [[InterCityExpress|ICE]] (2hr 59 min-3hr 16min).

The City has minor railway stations at [[Bockstael railway station|Bockstael]], [[Brussels-Chapel railway station|Brussels-Chapel]], [[Brussels-Congres railway station|Brussels-Congres]], [[Brussels-Luxembourg railway station|Brussels-Luxembourg]], [[Schuman station|Brussels-Schuman]], [[Brussels-West station|Brussels-West]], [[Haren railway station (Brussels)|Haren]], [[Haren-South railway station|Haren-South]], [[Simonis metro station|Simonis]].

In the Brussels Region there are also railways stations at [[Berchem-Sainte-Agathe railway station|Berchem-Sainte-Agathe]], [[Boitsfort railway station|Boitsfort]], [[Boondael railway station|Boondael]], [[Bordet railway station|Bordet (Evere)]], [[Etterbeek railway station|Etterbeek]], [[Evere railway station|Evere]], [[Forest-East railway station|Forest-East]], [[Forest-South railway station|Forest-South]], [[Jette railway station|Jette]], [[Meiser railway station|Meiser (Schaarbeek)]], [[Moensberg railway station|Moensberg (Uccle)]], [[Saint-Job railway station|Saint-Job (Uccle)]], [[Schaarbeek railway station|Schaarbeek]], [[Uccle-Calevoet railway station|Uccle-Calevoet]], [[Uccle-Stalle railway station|Uccle-Stalle]], [[Vivier d'Oie railway station|Vivier d'Oie-Diesdelle (Uccle)]], [[Merode station|Merode]] and [[Watermael railway station|Watermael]].

===City public transport===
The [[Brussels Metro]] dates back to 1976, but underground lines known as ''premetro'' have been serviced by tramways since 1968. A comprehensive bus and [[Brussels trams|tram network]] also covers the city.

An interticketing system means that a [[Brussels Intercommunal Transport Company|MIVB/STIB]] ticket holder can use the train or long-distance buses inside the city. A single journey can include multiple stages across the different modes of transport. The commuter services operated by [[De Lijn]], [[TEC (transport)|TEC]] and [[National Railway Company of Belgium|NMBS/SNCB]] will in the next few years be augmented by the [[Brussels RER]]/GEN network which will connect the capital and surrounding towns.

Since 2003 Brussels has had a car-sharing service operated by the [[Bremen]] company Cambio in partnership with the [[Brussels Intercommunal Transport Company|MIVB/STIB]] and local ridesharing company Taxi Stop. In 2006 shared bicycles were introduced, the scheme was subsequently being taken over by [[Villo!]]. In 2012, the Zen Car electric car-sharing scheme was launched in the university and European areas.

===Road network===
[[File:Wetstraat.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Rue de la Loi]] is one of the city's main streets]]

Brussels has the most congested traffic in North America and Europe according to US traffic information platform Inrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brussels and Antwerp have worst traffic|url=http://www.flanderstoday.eu/current-affairs/brussels-and-antwerp-have-worst-traffic|accessdate=8 December 2013|newspaper=Flanders Today|date=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medieval times Brussels stood at the intersection of routes running north-south (the modern Rue Haute/Hoogstraat) and east-west (Chaussée de Gand/Gentsesteenweg-Rue du Marché aux Herbes/Grasmarkt-Rue de Namur/Naamsestraat). The ancient pattern of streets radiating from the [[Grand Place]] in large part remains, but has been overlaid by boulevards built [[covering of the Senne|over the River Senne]], [[small ring (Brussels)|over the city walls]] and over the [[North-South connection|railway connection between the North and South Stations]].

As one expects of a capital city, Brussels is the hub of the fan of old national roads, the principal ones being clockwise the N1 (N to [[Breda]]), N2 (E to [[Maastricht]]), N3 (E to [[Aachen]]), N4 (SE to [[Luxembourg]]) N5 (S to [[Rheims]]), N6 (SW to [[Maubeuge]]), N8 (W to [[Koksijde]]) and N9 (NW to [[Ostend]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autosnelwegen.net/frames.html?/nb.html |title=Belgian N roads |publisher=Autosnelwegen.net |date= |accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually named ''chaussées/steenwegen'', these highways normally run in a straight line, but on occasion lose themselves in a maze of narrow shopping streets.

The town is skirted by the [[European route E19]] (N-S) and the [[European route E40|E40]] (E-W), while the [[E411]] leads away to the SE. Brussels has an [[beltway|orbital motorway]], numbered ''R0'' (R-zero) and commonly referred to as the &quot;ring&quot; (French: ''ring'' Dutch: ''ring''). It is pear-shaped as the southern side was never built as originally conceived, owing to residents' objections.

The city centre, sometimes known as &quot;the pentagon&quot;, is surrounded by an inner ring road, the &quot;[[small ring (Brussels)|small ring]]&quot; (French: ''petite ceinture'', Dutch: ''kleine ring'' ), a sequence of boulevards formally numbered ''R20''. These were built upon the site of the [[second walls of Brussels|second set of city walls]] following their demolition. Metro line 2 runs under much of these.

On the eastern side of the city, the ''R21'' (French: ''[[Greater ring (Brussels)|grande ceinture]]'', ''grote ring'' in Dutch) is formed by a string of boulevards that curves round from [[Laeken]] to [[Uccle]]. Some ''premetro'' stations (see [[Brussels Metro]]) were built on that route. A little further out, a stretch numbered R22 leads from Zaventem to [[Saint-Job]].
