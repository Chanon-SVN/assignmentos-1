In the World Wrestling Federation (now known as [[WWE]]), André was a [[List of WWE World Heavyweight Champions|one-time]] [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF Champion]]&lt;ref name=wwechamp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/304454122|title=Andre the Giant's first reign|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[List of World Tag Team Champions (WWE)|one-time]] [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF World Tag Team Champion]].&lt;ref name=tagchamp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321111121|title=Andre the Giant and Haku's first reign|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, André was the inaugural inductee into the [[WWE Hall of Fame|WWF Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wwebio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Andre the Giant: Bio|publisher=WWE|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/inductees/andrethegiant|accessdate=2011-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Legends&gt;{{cite book|title=WWE Legends|last=Solomon|first=Brian|pages=68–71|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2006|isbn=0-7434-9033-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
André Roussimoff was born in [[Grenoble]], France, to Boris and Mariann Roussimoff, a couple of [[Bulgaria]]n and [[Poland|Polish]] ancestry.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} As a child, he displayed symptoms of his [[gigantism]] very early, reaching a height of 6'3&quot; (190.5&amp;nbsp;cm) and a weight of {{convert|240|lb}} by the age of 12. Unable to fit on the school bus, he was driven to school by playwright [[Samuel Beckett]], a neighbor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420001825/http://historicalmeetups.com/post/1524567373/samuel-beckett-playwright-novelist-and-nobel |archivedate=April 20, 2012 |url=http://historicalmeetups.com/post/1524567373/samuel-beckett-playwright-novelist-and-nobel |title=Samuel Beckett Playwright, novelist, and Nobel |publisher=Historical Meet-Ups |date= |accessdate=2012-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nobel Prize winner in literature [[Samuel Beckett]] bought some land in 1953 near a hamlet around forty miles northeast of Paris and built a cottage for himself with the help of André's father Boris Rousimoff. When Beckett found out that Rousimoff was having trouble getting his son to school, Beckett offered to drive André to school in his truck — a vehicle that could fit André. When André recounted the drives with Beckett, he revealed they rarely talked about anything other than cricket.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.themarysue.com/samuel-beckett-andre-the-giant/|title = Samuel Beckett Used to Drive André the Giant to School, All They Talked About Was Cricket|date = July 11, 2011|accessdate = January 9, 2015|website = The Mary Sue|publisher = The Mary Sue|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Roussimoff was a good student, but he dropped out after the 8th grade since he did not think having a high school education was necessary for a farm laborer. He then worked on a farm, completed an [[apprenticeship]] in woodworking, and next worked in a factory that manufactured engines for [[baler|hay balers]]. None of these brought him any satisfaction.&lt;ref name=AEbio&gt;{{cite episode|title=André the Giant|series=Biography|network=[[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E Network]]|airdate=1998-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==

===Early career===
At age 17, Roussimoff moved to Paris and was taught the art of [[professional wrestling]] by a local promoter who recognized the earning potential of Roussimoff's size. He trained at night and worked as a mover during the day to pay living expenses.&lt;ref name=AEbio/&gt; Roussimoff was billed as &quot;Géant Ferré&quot;, taken from the name of a mythical French giant,&lt;ref name=LegendaryNames4/&gt; and began wrestling in Paris and nearby areas. Canadian promoter and wrestler Frank Valois met Roussimoff in 1966, becoming his business manager and adviser. Roussimoff began making a name for himself wrestling in the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, and Africa.&lt;ref name=LegendaryNames4&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=4|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LegendaryNames7&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=7|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AEbio/&gt;

He made his Japanese debut in 1970, billed as &quot;Monster Roussimoff&quot;, wrestling for the [[International Wrestling Enterprise]]. Wrestling as both a singles and tag team competitor, he quickly won the company's tag team championship alongside Michael Nador.&lt;ref name=LegendaryNames7/&gt;&lt;ref name=IWAtagchamp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/japan/iwe/iwe-t.html|title=IWA World Tag Team Title|publisher=Wrestling Titles|accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in Japan, doctors first informed Roussimoff that he suffered from [[acromegaly]].&lt;ref name=LegendaryNames7/&gt;&lt;ref name=AEbio/&gt;

Roussimoff next moved to [[Montréal]], Québec, where he became an immediate success, regularly selling out the [[Montreal Forum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pain and Passion|last=McCoy|first=Heath|page=96|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-1-55022-787-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, promoters eventually ran out of plausible opponents for him and, as the novelty of his size wore off, the gate receipts dwindled.&lt;ref name=AEbio/&gt; Roussimoff wrestled numerous times in 1972 for Verne Gagne's [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) as a special attraction until Valois appealed to [[Vince McMahon Sr.]], founder of the [[WWE|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (WWWF), for advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=9|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon suggested several changes. He felt Roussimoff should be portrayed as a large, immovable monster, and to enhance the perception of his size, McMahon discouraged Roussimoff from performing maneuvers such as [[dropkick]]s (although he was capable of performing such agile maneuvers before his health deteriorated in later life). He also began billing Roussimoff as &quot;André the Giant&quot; and set up a travel-intensive schedule, loaning him to wrestling associations around the world,&lt;ref name=Legends/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dusty: Reflections of an American Dream|last=Rhodes|first=Dusty|authorlink=Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|pages=95–96|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|year=2005|isbn=978-1-58261-907-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;headlocks71&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Sex, Lies and Headlocks: The Real Story of Vince McMahon and the World Wrestling Federation|publisher=[[Crown Publishing Group|Crown Publishers]]|last1=Assael|first1=Shaun|last2=Mooneyham|first2=Mike|page=71|year=2002|isbn=978-0-609-60690-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; to keep him from becoming overexposed in any area.&lt;ref name=AEbio/&gt; Promoters had to guarantee André a certain amount of money as well as pay McMahon's WWF booking fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|pages=12–13|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Wide Wrestling Federation/World Wrestling Federation===

====Debut and various feuds (1973–1987)====
On March 26, 1973, André debuted in the [[WWE|World Wide Wrestling Federation]] (later World Wrestling Federation) as a [[face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]], defeating [[Buddy Wolfe]] in New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].&lt;ref name=&quot;official&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Legends/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WWWF73&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/73.htm|title=WWWF @ New York City, NY – Madison Square Garden – March 26, 1973|publisher=The History of WWE|accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

André was one of professional wrestling's most beloved &quot;babyfaces&quot; throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. As such, [[Gorilla Monsoon]] insisted that André was never defeated for 15 years by pinfall or submission prior to WrestleMania III. This, however, is not true. André actually had lost cleanly in matches outside WWF parameters: a pinfall loss in Mexico to [[Canek (wrestler)|Canek]] in 1984 and a submission loss in Japan to [[Antonio Inoki]] in June 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;Legendary110&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=110|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puroresucentral.com/inoki.html|title=Antonio Inoki: Career History|publisher=Puroresu Central|accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had sixty-minute time limit draws with the two other major world champions of the day, [[Harley Race]] and [[Nick Bockwinkel]].

In 1976 André fought professional boxer [[Chuck Wepner]] in an unscripted boxer-vs-wrestler fight. The wild fight was shown via telecast as part of the undercard of the [[Muhammad Ali]] vs Antonio Inoki fight and ended when André threw Wepner over the top rope and outside the ring.

In 1980, he feuded with Hulk Hogan, wrestling him at Shea Stadium's [[Showdown at Shea]] and in Pennsylvania. The feud continued in Japan in 1982 and 1983.

In 1982, Vince McMahon, Sr. sold the World Wrestling Federation to his son, [[Vince McMahon|Vince McMahon, Jr.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Wrestling Alliance: The Untold Story of the Monopoly That Strangled Pro Wrestling|last=Hornbaker|first=Tim|page=193|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-1-55022-741-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As McMahon began to expand his newly acquired promotion to the national level, he required his wrestlers to appear exclusively for him. McMahon signed André to these terms in 1984, although he still allowed the Giant to work in Japan for [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|pages=69–70|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of André's feuds pitted him against &quot;the Mongolian Giant&quot; [[Killer Khan]]. According to the storyline, Khan had snapped André's ankle during a match on May 2, 1981, in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York]], by leaping off the top rope and crashing down upon it with his knee-drop.&lt;ref name=MainEvent&gt;{{cite book|title=Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s|last=Shields|first=Brian|pages=55–58|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4165-3257-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, André had broken his ankle getting out of bed the morning before the match.&lt;ref name=AEbio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=48|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injury and subsequent rehabilitation was worked into the existing André/Khan storyline. After a stay at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, André returned with payback on his mind. The two battled on July 20, 1981, at Madison Square Garden in a match that resulted in a [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|double disqualification]]. Their feud continued as fans filled arenas up and down the [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] to witness their matches. On November 14, 1981, at the [[Spectrum (arena)|Philadelphia Spectrum]], André decisively defeated Khan in what was billed as a &quot;Mongolian Stretcher Match&quot;, in which the loser must be taken to the dressing room on a stretcher.&lt;ref name=Legendary48&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|pages=48–60|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Andre the Giant.jpg|thumb|André (second from right) feuded with [[Big John Studd]] (left) in the build towards [[WrestleMania I]], and later with [[King Kong Bundy]] (second from left).]]
Another feud involved a man who considered himself to be &quot;the true giant&quot; of wrestling: [[Big John Studd]].&lt;ref name=MainEvent/&gt; Throughout the early to mid 1980s, André and Studd fought all over the world, battling to try to determine who the real giant of wrestling was. In December 1984, Studd took the feud to a new level when he and partner [[Ken Patera]] knocked out André during a televised tag team match and proceeded to cut off André's hair.&lt;ref name=MainEvent/&gt; After gaining revenge on Patera, André met Studd in a &quot;[[Professional wrestling throws#Body slam|Body Slam]] Challenge&quot; at the first [[WrestleMania I|WrestleMania]], held March 31, 1985, at Madison Square Garden in New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shields2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Shields|title=Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ktv7Nj2C9QUC&amp;pg=PA150|date=15 June 2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4516-0467-2|pages=150–}}&lt;/ref&gt; André slammed Studd to win the match and collect the [[United States dollar|$]]15,000 prize, then proceeded to throw cash to the fans before having the bag stolen from him by Studd's manager, [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby &quot;The Brain&quot; Heenan]].&lt;ref name=WMIfacts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm1/factsstats/|title=WrestleMania I Facts/Stats|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, at [[WrestleMania 2]] on April 7, 1986, André continued to display his dominance by winning a twenty-man [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]] which featured top [[National Football League|NFL]] stars and wrestlers.&lt;ref name=WM2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm2/results/|title=WrestleMania 2 results|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; André last eliminated [[Bret Hart]] to win the contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=107|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After WrestleMania 2, André continued his feud with Studd and [[King Kong Bundy]]. At about this time, André requested a leave of absence to tend to his health&amp;mdash;effects from his acromegaly were beginning to take their toll&amp;mdash;as well as tour Japan. He had also gotten a part in the film ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''. To explain Andre's absence, a storyline was developed to have Heenan&amp;mdash;suggesting that André was secretly afraid of Studd and Bundy, whom Heenan bragged were unbeatable&amp;mdash;challenge Andre and a partner of his choosing to wrestle Studd and Bundy in a televised tag team match. When Andre failed to show, WWF President [[Jack Tunney]] indefinitely suspended Andre.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|pages=12–13|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley|DK]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the summer of 1986, upon Andre's return to the United States, he began wearing a mask and competing as the &quot;Giant Machine&quot; in a stable known as [[The Machines (professional wrestling)|The Machines]]. ([[Blackjack Mulligan|Big Machine]] and [[Bill Eadie|Super Machine]] were the other members.) The WWF's television announcers sold the Machines&amp;mdash;a gimmick was copied from [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] character &quot;Super Strong Machine&quot;, played by Japanese wrestler [[Junji Hirata]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/m/machines.html|title=The Machines' Profile|publisher=Online World of Wrestling|accessdate=2007-07-08| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070621210036/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/m/machines.html| archivedate= 21 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash;as &quot;a new tag team from Japan&quot; and claimed not to know the identities of the wrestlers, even though it was obvious to fans and the television audience that it was André competing as the Giant Machine. Heenan, Studd, and Bundy complained to Tunney, who eventually told Heenan that if it could be proven that André and the Giant Machine were the same person, André would be fired. André thwarted Heenan, Studd, and Bundy at every turn. Then, in late 1986, the Giant Machine &quot;disappeared,&quot; and André was reinstated. Foreshadowing André's heel turn, Heenan expressed his approval of the reinstatement but did not explain why.

====Feud with Hulk Hogan and WWF Champion (1987–1988)====
[[File:Andre and Bobby Heenan.jpg|thumb|right|Andre was managed by [[Bobby Heenan]] (seen in front of him) during some of his feud with [[Hulk Hogan]].]]
André agreed to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]] [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] in early 1987 to be the counter to the biggest &quot;[[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]]&quot; in professional wrestling at that time, [[Hulk Hogan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=131|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; On an edition of ''[[Piper's Pit]]'' in January 1987, Hogan was presented a trophy for being the [[WWE World Heavyweight Championship|WWF Champion]] for three years; André came out to congratulate him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|pages=132–133|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the following week's ''Piper's Pit'', André was presented a slightly smaller trophy for being &quot;the only undefeated wrestler in wrestling history.&quot; Although André had suffered a handful of [[Professional wrestling#Countout|countout]] and [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]] losses in WWF, he had never been pinned or forced to submit in a WWF ring. Hogan came out to congratulate André and ended up being the focal point of the interview. A visibly &quot;annoyed&quot; André walked out in the midst of Hogan's speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|pages=134–135|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm|title=WWF @ East Rutherford, NJ – Meadowlands – January 5, 1987|publisher=The History of WWE|accessdate=2011-04-02| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110510061259/http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm| archivedate= 10 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A &quot;discussion&quot; between André and Hogan was scheduled, and on a ''Piper's Pit'' that aired February 7, 1987, the two met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm|title=WWF @ Tampa, FL – SunDome – January 26, 1987|publisher=The History of WWE|accessdate=2011-03-27| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110510061259/http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/87.htm| archivedate= 10 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hogan was introduced first, followed by André. André was led by longtime rival Bobby Heenan. 

Speaking on behalf of his new protégé, Heenan accused Hogan of only being André's friend so he wouldn't have to defend his title against him. Hogan tried to reason with André but his pleas were ignored as he challenged Hogan to a match for the WWF Championship at [[WrestleMania III]]. Hogan still couldn't believe what André was doing, prompting Heenan to say &quot;You can't believe it, maybe you'll believe this Hogan&quot; before André ripped the T-shirt and crucifix from Hogan, André's fingernail scratched Hogan's chest while ripping the shirt off which caused Hogan to bleed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|pages=136–139|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Hogan's acceptance of André's challenge on a later edition of Piper's Pit, the two were part of a 20-man over the top rope [[Battle Royal (professional wrestling)|Battle Royal]] on the March 14 edition of [[Saturday Night's Main Event results|Saturday Night's Main Event]] at the [[Joe Louis Arena]] in [[Detroit]]. Although the Battle Royal was won by [[Ray Fernandez|Hercules]], André gained a psychological advantage over Hogan when he threw the WWF Champion over the top rope. The match, which was actually taped on February 21, 1987, aired only 2 weeks before Wrestlemania III to make it seem like Hogan had met his match in André the Giant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIfSsZa186w SNME Battle Royal 1987]&lt;/ref&gt;

At WrestleMania III, he was billed at {{convert|520|lb|kg|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=WMIII&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm3/mainevent/|title=WrestleMania III – André the Giant vs. Hulk Hogan – WWE Championship|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the stress of such immense weight on his bones and joints resulted in constant pain.&lt;ref name=AEbio/&gt; After recent back surgery, he was also wearing a brace underneath his wrestling singlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sex, Lies and Headlocks: The Real Story of Vince McMahon and the World Wrestling Federation|publisher=[[Crown Publishing Group|Crown Publishers]]|last1=Assael|first1=Shaun|last2=Mooneyham|first2=Mike|pages=71–72|year=2002|isbn=978-0-609-60690-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In front of a record crowd of 93,173 Hogan won the match after body slamming (later dubbed &quot;the bodyslam heard around the world&quot;) André, followed by Hogan's running leg drop finisher.&lt;ref name=WMIII/&gt; Years later, Hogan claimed that André was so heavy, he felt more like {{convert|700|lb|kg|abbr=on}}, and that he actually tore his [[latissimus dorsi muscle]] slamming him. 

Another famous story about the match is that no one, not even WWF owner [[Vince McMahon]], knew until the day of the event if André would lose the match. In reality André had agreed to lose the match some time before, mostly for health reasons, though he almost pinned Hogan (albeit unintentionally) in the second minute of the match after Hogan tried to slam The Giant but couldn't hold his weight. Contrary to popular belief, it was not the first time that Hogan had successfully body slammed André in a WWF match. A then-heel Hogan slammed a then-face André following their match at the &quot;[[Showdown at Shea]]&quot; on August 9, 1980, though André was much lighter (around {{convert|470|lb|kg|abbr=on}}) and more athletic at the time (Hogan also slammed André in a match in [[Hamburg, Pennsylvania|Hamburg]], [[Pennsylvania|PA]] a month later).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Hulk Hogan: The Ultimate Anthology|medium=DVD|publisher=[[WWE]]|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This took place in the territorial days of American wrestling three years before WWF began national expansion, so many of those who watched WrestleMania III had never seen The Giant slammed (André had also previously allowed [[Harley Race]], [[Canek (wrestler)|El Canek]] and [[Stan Hansen]], among others, to slam him.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=157|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=King of the Ring: The Harley Race Story|last=Race|first=Harley|authorlink=Harley Race|page=90|publisher=Sports Publishing L.L.C.|year=2004|isbn=978-1-58261-818-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the time WrestleMania III had rolled around, the WWF had gone national, giving more meaning to the André–Hogan match that took place then. The feud between André and Hogan simmered during the summer of 1987, even as Roussimoff's health declined. The feud began heating up again when each wrestler was named the captain of rival teams at the inaugural [[Survivor Series (1987)|Survivor Series]] event. André's team won the main event after André pinned [[Bam Bam Bigelow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1987/mainevent/|title=Survivor Series 1987 – Main Event|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the meantime, [[Ted DiBiase|&quot;The Million Dollar Man&quot; Ted DiBiase]] failed to persuade Hogan to sell him the WWF Championship. After failing to defeat Hogan in a subsequent series of matches, DiBiase turned to André to win it for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|pages=172–175|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acting as his hired gun, André won the WWF title from Hogan (his first title) on February 5, 1988 in a match where it was later revealed appointed referee [[Dave Hebner]] was &quot;detained backstage&quot;, and a replacement (whom Hogan afterwards initially accused of having been paid by DiBiase to get plastic surgery to look like Dave,&lt;ref&gt;Hulk Hogan postmatch interview, ''The Main Event'' NBC television February 5, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; but in fact was revealed to have been his 'evil' twin brother [[Earl Hebner]]),&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A ''WWF Magazine'' Investigative Report: Dave Hebner's Shadow,&quot; ''[[WWE Magazine|WWF Magazine]]'', June 1988, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; made a three count on Hogan while his shoulders were off the mat. 

After winning, André &quot;sold&quot; the title to DiBiase; the transaction was declared invalid by then-[[Professional wrestling authority figures|WWF President]] [[Jack Tunney]] and the title was vacated.&lt;ref name=wwechamp/&gt; This was shown on WWF's [[NBC]] program ''[[WWF The Main Event|The Main Event]]''. At [[WrestleMania IV]], André and Hulk Hogan fought to a double disqualification in a WWF title tournament match (with the idea in the storyline saying that André was again working on DiBiase's behalf in giving DiBiase a clearer path in the tournament). Afterward, André and Hogan's feud died down after a steel cage match held at ''WrestleFest'' on July 31, 1988 in Milwaukee.

At the inaugural [[SummerSlam (1988)|SummerSlam]] pay-per-view held at [[Madison Square Garden]], André and DiBiase (billed as &quot;The Mega Bucks&quot;) faced Hogan and WWF Champion [[Randy Savage|&quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage]] (known as The Mega Powers) in the main event, with [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse &quot;the Body&quot; Ventura]] as the special guest referee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1988/mainevent1/|title=SummerSlam 1988 main event match details|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the match, The Mega Powers' manager [[Miss Elizabeth]] (Savage's real life wife Elizabeth Hulette) distracted The Mega Bucks and Ventura when she climbed up on the ring apron, removed her yellow skirt and walked around in a pair of red panties. This allowed Hogan and Savage time to recover and eventually win the match with Hogan pinning DiBiase.

Concurrent with the developing feud with the Mega Powers, André was placed in a feud with [[Jim Duggan]], which began after Duggan knocked out André with a two-by-four timber during a television taping. Despite Duggan's popularity with fans, André regularly got the upper hand in the feud.

====Various feuds and The Colossal Connection (1988–1990)====
[[File:Jake Roberts and Andre.jpg|thumb|André feuded with [[Jake Roberts]] based on André's fear of snakes.]]
André's next major feud was against [[Jake Roberts]]. In this storyline, it was said André was [[Ophidiophobia|afraid of snakes]], something Roberts exposed on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' when he threw his snake, Damien, on the frightened André; as a result, André suffered a [[kayfabe]] mild heart attack and vowed revenge. During the next few weeks, Roberts frequently walked to ringside during André's matches, causing him to run from the ring in fright (since he knew what was inside the bag). Throughout their feud (which culminated at [[WrestleMania V]]), Roberts constantly used Damien to gain a psychological edge over the much larger and stronger André.

In 1989, André and the returning Big John Studd briefly reprised their feud, this time with Studd as a face and André as the heel. During the late summer and fall of 1989, André engaged in a brief feud, almost entirely consisting of [[house show]]s (non-televised events), with then-[[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental champion]] [[Warrior (wrestler)|The Ultimate Warrior]]. The younger Warrior, WWF's rising star, regularly [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Squash|squashed]] the aging André in an attempt to showcase his star quality and promote him as the &quot;next big thing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|pages=297–300|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling|last=Hart|first=Bret|authorlink=Bret Hart|page=233|publisher=[[Hachette Book Group USA#Current imprints|Grand Central Publishing]]|year=2008|isbn=978-0-446-53972-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1989, André was joined with fellow [[The Heenan Family|Heenan Family]] member [[Tonga Fifita|Haku]] to form a new tag team called The [[Colossal Connection]], in part to fill a void left by the departure of [[Tully Blanchard]] and [[Arn Anderson]] (The [[Brain Busters]], who were also members of Heenan's stable) from the WWF, and also to continue to keep the aging André in the main event spotlight. The Colossal Connection immediately targeted WWF Tag Team Champions [[Demolition (professional wrestling)|Demolition]] (who had recently won the belts from the Brain Busters). At a television taping on December 13, 1989, the Colossal Connection defeated Demolition to win the titles.&lt;ref name=tagchamp/&gt; André and Haku successfully defended their titles, mostly against Demolition, until [[WrestleMania VI]] on April 1, 1990, when Demolition took advantage of a mistimed move by the champions to regain the belts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/worldtagteam/3044541321241|title=Demolition's third reign|publisher=[[WWE]]|accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, a furious Heenan blamed André for the title loss and after shouting at him slapped him in the face; an angry André responded with a slap of his own that sent Heenan staggering from the ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|pages=321–322|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; André also caught Haku's kick attempt, sending him reeling from the ring as well, prompting loud cheers for André for the first time in three years. André went into the match as a heel, but left as a face. Due to his ongoing health issues, André wasn't actually able to wrestle at the time of Wrestlemania VI and Haku actually wrestled the entire match against Demolition without tagging in André.

====Sporadic appearances (1990–1992)====
André continued to make appearances in the WWF throughout 1990 and 1991. He came to the aid of [[Ray Traylor|The Big Boss Man]] in his [[WrestleMania VII]] match against [[Curt Hennig|Mr. Perfect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=326|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point he was advertised to enter the 1991 Royal Rumble, but backed out due to a leg injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|v-VFCvdFtbc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andre finally returned to action on April 26, 1991 in a six man tag-team matchup when he tagged with the Rockers in a winning effort against Mr. Fuji and The Orient Express at a house show in Belfast, Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name=&quot;thehistoryofwwe.com&quot;&gt;http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm&lt;/ref&gt; On May 10 he participated in a 17 man battle royal on a house show in Detroit, MI.&lt;ref name=&quot;thehistoryofwwe.com&quot;/&gt; (won by Kerry Von Erich). His last major WWF storyline following WrestleMania VII had the major heel managers (Bobby Heenan, [[Sherri Martel|Sensational Sherri]], [[Ken Johnson (wrestling)|Slick]], and [[Mr. Fuji]]) trying to recruit André one-by-one, only to be turned down in various humiliating ways (e.g. Heenan had his hand crushed, Sherri received a spanking, Slick got locked in the trunk of the car he was offering to André and Mr Fuji got a pie in his face). Finally, [[Jimmy Hart]] appeared live on WWF Superstars to announce that he successfully signed André to tag-team with [[John Tenta|Earthquake]]. However, when asked to confirm by [[Gene Okerlund]], André denied the claims. This cemented André's face turn. This led to Earthquake attacking André from behind (injuring his knee).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm | title = WWF Show Results 1991 | accessdate =2011-03-05| author = Graham Cawthon | quote = (Date: May 6, 1991 Shown: June 1, 1991)Included an in-ring interview by Gene Okerlund in which André the Giant refused Jimmy Hart's offer to become his manager only to have his knee attacked by Earthquake, using Hart's megaphone}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jimmy Hart would later get revenge for the humiliation by secretly signing [[Fred Ottman|Tugboat]] and forming [[The Natural Disasters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/91.htm | title = WWF Show Results 1991 | accessdate =2011-03-05| author = Graham Cawthon | quote = (Date: May 28, 1991 Shown: June 15, 1991)Earthquake &amp; WWF Tag Team Champions the Nasty Boys (w/ Jimmy Hart) defeated Tugboat &amp; the Bushwhackers at 4:05 when Earthquake pinned Luke with a sit-down splash after Tugboat attacked both of his teammates; after the match, Tugboat embraced with his new friends}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to André's final major WWF appearance at [[SummerSlam (1991)|SummerSlam]] '91, where he seconded [[The Bushwhackers]] in their match against the Disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=333|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andre was on crutches at ringside, when the Disasters won the match they set out to attack Andre, but the Legion of Doom (wearing the football pads with large spikes they wore during their ring entrances) made their way to ringside and got in between them and The Giant who was preparing to defend himself with one of his crutches. The Disasters left the ringside area as they were outnumbered by the Legion of Doom, the Bushwhackers and Andre, who struck both Earthquake and Typhoon (the former Tugboat) with the crutch as they left. His final WWF appearance came on a house show in Paris, France on October 9. He was in Davey Boy Smith's corner as the Bulldog faced Earthquake. Davey Boy hit Earthquake with Andre's crutch, allowing Smith to win.

His last [[United States|U.S.]] television appearance was in a brief interview on [[World Championship Wrestling]]'s (WCW) ''[[Clash of the Champions#Clash of the Champions XX: 20th Anniversary|Clash of the Champions XX]]'' special that aired on [[TBS (TV channel)|TBS]] on September 2, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=336|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===All Japan Pro Wrestling and Universal Wrestling Association (1990–1992)===
After WrestleMania VI, André spent the rest of his in-ring career in [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW) and Mexico's [[Universal Wrestling Association]]. He toured with AJPW three times per year, from September 1990 to 1992, usually teaming with [[Giant Baba]] in tag team matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=335|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did his final tour of Mexico through April and May 1992 in a selection of six-man tag matches alongside [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] and a variety of Lucha Libre stars facing among others [[Bad News Allen]] and future WWF Champion [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&amp;nr=926&amp;page=4&amp;year=1992&amp;promotion=68&lt;/ref&gt; He wrestled his final match for AJPW in December 1992.

==Acting career==
André branched out into acting again in the 1970s and 1980s, after a 1967 French boxing movie, making his USA acting debut playing a Sasquatch (&quot;[[Bigfoot]]&quot;) on the 1970s television series ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|pages=18–19|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in other television shows, including ''[[The Greatest American Hero]]'', ''[[B. J. and the Bear]]'', ''[[The Fall Guy]]'' and 1990s ''[[Zorro (1990 TV series)|Zorro]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0755189/|title=&quot;Zorro&quot; Big Brother (TV episode 1991)|publisher=IMDb|accessdate=2011-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of his career, André starred in several films. He had an uncredited appearance in the 1984 film ''[[Conan the Destroyer]]'' as Dagoth,&lt;ref name=&quot;Legendary79&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=79|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087078/fullcredits#cast|title=Full cast and crew for Conan the Destroyer|publisher=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; the resurrected horned giant god who is killed by Conan ([[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]). That same year, André also made an appearance in ''[[Micki + Maude]]'' (billed as André Rousimmoff).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087718/fullcredits#cast|title=Full cast and crew for Micki + Maude|publisher=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared most notably as Fezzik, his own favorite role,&lt;ref name=&quot;official&quot;/&gt; in the 1987 film ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''. Both the film and André's performance retain a devoted following.

In his last film, he appeared in a cameo role as a circus giant in the comedy ''[[Trading Mom]]'', which was released a year after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0111470/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070213084344/http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0111470/|archivedate=2007-02-13|title=''Trading Mom'' (IMDB)|accessdate=2008-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Roussimoff had one daughter,&lt;ref name=AEbio/&gt; Robin Christensen Roussimoff, who was born in 1979.

André was mentioned in the 1974 [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]] as the highest-paid wrestler in history at that time. He had earned US $400,000 in one year during the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=18|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roussimoff has been unofficially crowned &quot;The Greatest Drunk on Earth&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=123|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; for once consuming 119 {{convert|12|USfloz|adj=on}} beers (over 41 litres) in 6 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madconomist.com/5-coolest-beer-records|title=5 Coolest Beer Records|publisher=MadConomist|last=Davydov|first=Dmitri|date=2008-05-20|accessdate=2011-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On an episode of WWE's ''Legends of Wrestling'', [[Mike Graham (wrestler)|Mike Graham]] said André once drank 156, {{convert|16|USfloz|ml|adj=on}} beers in one sitting, which was confirmed by [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]]. In her autobiography, [[The Fabulous Moolah]] writes that André drank 127 beers in a [[Reading, Pennsylvania]], hotel bar and later passed out in the lobby. The staff could not move him and had to leave him there until the giant awoke from his slumber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellison|first=Lillian|authorlink=The Fabulous Moolah|title=The Fabulous Moolah: First Goddess of the Squared Circle|year=2003|isbn=978-0-06-001258-8|publisher=ReaganBooks|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legend has it that when André underwent surgery in 1987, his size made it impossible for the [[anesthesiologist]] to estimate a dosage via standard methods; consequently, his alcohol tolerance (&quot;it usually takes two liters of [[vodka]] just to make me feel warm inside&quot;) was used as a guideline instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nypost.com/2013/10/27/true-stories-from-the-fake-world-of-pro-wrestling/ True stories from the fake world of wrestling], by David Shoemaker, at the ''[[New York Post]]''; published October 27, 2013; retrieved March 27, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

André was arrested by the [[Linn County, Iowa]], sheriff in August 1989 and charged with assault after he allegedly roughed up a local television cameraman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback |date=20080530034919 |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/andregiantmug1.html |title=The Smoking Gun }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=300|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a eulogy after his death, [[William Goldman]], the author of the novel and the screenplay of ''The Princess Bride'', wrote in his nonfiction work ''[[Which Lie Did I Tell?]]'' that André was one of the gentlest and most generous people he ever knew. Whenever André treated someone to a meal in a restaurant he would pay, but he would also insist on paying when he was a guest. After one meal, [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] had quietly moved to the cashier to pay before André could, but then found himself being physically lifted, carried from his table, and deposited on top of his car by André and [[Wilt Chamberlain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/videos/2012/09/arnold-schwarzeneggers-dinner-wilt-chamberlain-andre-giant/ |title=Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Dinner With Wilt Chamberlain and Andre the Giant |first= |last= |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2014-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roussimoff died in his sleep of [[Heart failure|congestive heart failure]] on the night of January 27, 1993, in a Paris hotel room.&lt;ref name=&quot;official&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|page=337|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was in Paris to attend his father's funeral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE3D6113AF932A05752C0A965958260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Andre&amp;st=nyt Andre the Giant, 46, Professional Wrestler (Obituary)] ''New York Times'', 31 January 1993. &lt;!--retrieved 2008-06-23--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His body was [[cremated]] according to his wishes and his ashes were scattered at his ranch in [[Ellerbe, North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=AEbio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/video/4797970/ |title=WRAL News, Raleigh, NC |publisher=Wral.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Cesaro Andre the Giant trophy.jpg|thumb|[[Antonio Cesaro|Cesaro]] with the André the Giant Memorial Trophy, created in André's likeness.]]
*In 1993 when the then-[[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] created the [[WWE Hall of Fame|WWF Hall of Fame]], André the Giant was the inaugural inductee&lt;ref name=&quot;wwebio&quot;/&gt; (and the only 1993 inductee).
*André was the inspiration for the [[1998 in film|1998 film]] ''[[My Giant]]'', written by his friend [[Billy Crystal]], whom he had met during the filming of ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]''.
*Paul Wight, better known as &quot;The [[Big Show]]&quot;, is more similar in body structure to André than any other wrestler since André's death. He was originally billed as the son of Andre during his stint in [[World Championship Wrestling|WCW]] (when he was known as simply &quot;The Giant&quot;) despite no biological relation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=André the Giant: A Legendary Life|last=Krugman|first=Michael|pages=341–342|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4165-4112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; While also suffering from [[acromegaly]], unlike André, Wight did get surgery on his [[pituitary gland]] in the early 1990s, which successfully halted the progress of his condition. The former wrestler [[Jorge González (wrestler)|Giant González]] suffered from problems similar to those that André had near the end of his life and died in September 2010 due to [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] complications.
