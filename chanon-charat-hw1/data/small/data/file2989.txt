'''Bjørn Lomborg''' ({{IPA-da|bjɶɐ̯n ˈlʌmbɒˀw|lang}}; born 6 January 1965) is the director of the [[Copenhagen Consensus Center]] and a former director of the [[Environmental Assessment Institute]] in [[Copenhagen]]. He became internationally known for his best-selling and controversial book, ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]'' (2001).

In 2002, Lomborg and the [[Environmental Assessment Institute]] founded the [[Copenhagen Consensus]], a project-based conference where prominent economists sought to establish priorities for advancing global welfare using methods based on the theory of [[welfare economics]].

Lomborg campaigned against the [[Kyoto Protocol]] and other measures to cut carbon emissions in the short-term, and argued for adaptation to short-term temperature rises as they are inevitable, and for spending money on research and development for longer-term environmental solutions, and on other important world problems such as AIDS, malaria and malnutrition. In his critique of the 2012 [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]], Lomborg stated: &quot;Global warming is by no means our main environmental threat.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/wrongheaded-in-rio | title=Wrongheaded in Rio|year=2012 |work=[[Project Syndicate]] | first1=Bjørn | last1=Lomborg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the chapter on climate change in ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', he states: &quot;This chapter accepts the reality of man-made global warming but questions the way in which future scenarios have been arrived at and finds that forecasts of climate change of 6 degrees by the end of the century are not plausible&quot;.{{sfn|Lomborg|2001|p=259}} [[Cost–benefit analyses]], calculated by the [[Copenhagen Consensus]], ranked climate mitigation initiatives lowest on a list of international development initiatives when first done in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/sites/default/files/2004copenhagen_consensus_result_final.pdf | title=Copenhagen Consensus: The Results | publisher=Copenhagen Consensus Center | accessdate=21 November 2014}} &quot;Optimal carbon tax,&quot; &quot;The Kyoto Protocol,&quot; and &quot;Value-at-risk carbon tax&quot; ranked 15, 16, and 17 on a ranked list of 17 evaluated projects, with a collective Project Rating of Bad.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 interview with the ''[[New Statesman]]'', Lomborg summarized his position on climate change: &quot;Global warming is real – it is man-made and it is an important problem. But it is not the end of the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elmhirst|first=Sophie|date=2010-09-24|title=The NS Interview: Bjørn Lomborg|journal=New Statesman|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/environment/2010/09/interview-gay-climate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
Lomborg spent a year as an undergraduate at the [[University of Georgia]], earned an [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] degree in [[political science]] at the [[University of Aarhus]] in 1991, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in political science at the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1994.

He lectured in [[statistics]] in the Department of Political Science at the University of Aarhus as an [[assistant professor]] (1994&amp;ndash;1996) and [[associate professor]] (1997&amp;ndash;2005).  He left the university in February 2005 and in May of that year became an [[Professors in the United States#Adjunct professor|Adjunct Professor]] at [[Copenhagen Business School]].

Early in his career his professional areas of interest lay in the simulation of strategies in [[collective action]] [[Ethical dilemma|dilemmas]], simulation of [[political party|party]] behavior in [[Party-list proportional representation|proportional voting systems]], and the use of surveys in [[public administration]].  In 1996, Lomborg's paper, &quot;Nucleus and Shield: Evolution of [[Social structure|Social Structure]] in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma&quot;, was published in the [[academic journal]], ''[[American Sociological Review]]''.&lt;ref name=1996Nucleus&gt;{{Cite journal

Later Lomborg's interests shifted to the use of statistics in the [[Environmental movement|environmental arena]].  His most famous book in this area is ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', whose English translation was published as a work in [[environmental economics]] by Cambridge University Press in 2001. He later edited ''Global Crises, Global Solutions'', which presented the first conclusions of the [[Copenhagen Consensus]], published in 2004 by the Cambridge University Press. In 2007, he authored a book entitled ''Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming.''

== ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' ==
:''Main article:'' ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]''

In 1998, Lomborg published four [[essay]]s about the state of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]] in the leading Danish newspaper ''[[Politiken]]'', which according to him &quot;resulted in a firestorm debate spanning over 400 articles in major metropolitan newspapers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lomborg.com/about/biography/ Bjørn Lomborg Biography], www.lomborg.com. Retrieved 26 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Why are these essays mentioned? Were they a trial run or short version of THE BOOK THIS SECTION IS ABOUT? --&gt;

In 2001, he attained significant attention by publishing ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', a controversial book whose main thesis is that many of the most-publicized claims and predictions on environmental issues are wrong.

=== Formal accusations of scientific dishonesty ===
After the publication of ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', Lomborg was formally accused of scientific dishonesty by a group of environmental scientists, who brought a total of three complaints against him to the [[Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty]] (DCSD), a body under Denmark's [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation of Denmark|Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation]] (MSTI). Lomborg was asked whether he regarded the book as a &quot;debate&quot; publication, and thereby not under the purview of the DCSD, or as a scientific work; he chose the latter, clearing the way for the inquiry that followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;icg2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cprm.gov.br/33IGC/1343527.html | title=The 'Lomborg case' on sustainable development and scientific dishonesty | publisher=International Geological Congress | date=2008 | accessdate=23 November 2014 | author=Hansen, Jens Morten}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges claimed that ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' contained deliberately misleading data and flawed conclusions. Due to the similarity of the complaints, the DCSD decided to proceed on the three cases under one investigation.

In January, 2003, the DCSD released a ruling that sent a mixed message, finding the book to be scientifically dishonest through misrepresentation of scientific facts, but Lomborg himself not guilty due to his lack of expertise in the fields in question:&lt;ref&gt;[http://fivu.dk/en/publications/2004/annual-report-2003-the-danish-committees-on-scientific-dishonesty The Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty: 2003 Annual Report]. Retrieved 13 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; That February, Lomborg filed a complaint against the decision with the MSTI, which had oversight over the DCSD. In December, 2003, the Ministry annulled the DCSD decision, citing procedural errors, including lack of documentation of errors in the book, and asked the DCSD to re-examine the case. In March 2004, the DCSD formally decided not to act further on the complaints, reasoning that renewed scrutiny would, in all likelihood, result in the same conclusion.&lt;ref name=icg2008 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3340305.stm | title = Lomborg celebrates ministry ruling | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | work = | publisher = [[BBC]] | date = 22 December 2003 | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Response of the scientific community ====
The original DCSD decision about Lomborg provoked a [[petition]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.ku.dk/~dlando/indsamling.htm &quot;Underskriftsindsamling i protest mod afgørelsen om Bjørn Lomborg fra - Udvalgene Vedrørende Videnskabelig Uredelighed&quot;]. Retrieved 26 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; among Danish academics. 308 scientists, many of them from the social sciences, criticised the DCSD's methods in the case and called for the DCSD to be disbanded.&lt;ref name=disbandDCSD&gt;{{Cite web

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Danish Minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation then asked the Danish Research Agency (DRA) to
form an independent working group to review DCSD practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fi.dk/site/english/publications/2003/annual-report-2002-danish-committees-scientific-dishonesty The Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty: 2002 Annual Report]. Retrieved 13 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, another group of Danish scientists collected over 600 signatures, primarily from the medical and [[natural science]]s community, to support the continued existence of the DCSD and presented their petition to the DRA.&lt;ref name=disbandDCSD /&gt;

=== Recognition ===
The alumni network of the [[Cambridge Programme for Sustainability Leadership]] (CPSL) voted ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' among its list of the top 50 sustainability books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1= Visser |first1= Wayne |title=The Top 50 Sustainability Books |year= 2009 |publisher= Greenleaf Publishing |location= Cambridge |isbn= 978-1-906093-32-7|pages=256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continued debate and criticism ==
The rulings of the Danish authorities in 2003&amp;ndash;2004 left Lomborg's critics frustrated. Lomborg claimed vindication as a result of MSTI's decision to set aside the original finding of DCSD.

''The Lomborg Deception'', a book by [[Howard Friel]], claims to offer a &quot;careful analysis&quot; of the ways in which Lomborg has &quot;selectively used (and sometimes distorted) the available evidence&quot;.&lt;ref name=pk&gt;

[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/328/5983/1230-a.pdf The Climate Change Debates] ''Science'', Vol. 328, 4 June 2010, p. 1232.&lt;/ref&gt; Lomborg has provided a 27-page argument-by-argument [http://www.lomborg.com/dyn/files/basic_items/118-file/BL%20reply%20to%20Howard%20Friel.pdf rebuttal]. Friel has written a reply to this rebuttal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Response by Howard Friel to Bjørn Lomborg’s comments about The Lomborg Deception. February 26, 2010. 
|publisher=Yale Press
|accessdate=13 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he admits two errors, but otherwise in general rejects Lomborg's arguments.

A group of scientists published an article in 2005 in the ''[[Journal of Information Ethics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Rörsch, A. et al. |title=On the opposition against the book The Skeptical Environmentalist by B. Lomborg |journal=Journal of Information Ethics |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=16–28 |date=Spring 2005 |doi=10.3172/JIE.14.1.16}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they concluded that most criticism against Lomborg was unjustified, and that the scientific community misused their authority to suppress Lomborg.

The claim that the accusations against Lomborg were unjustified was challenged in the next issue of ''Journal of Information Ethics''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Fog, K. |title=The real nature of the opposition against B. Lomborg |journal=Journal of Information Ethics |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=66–76 |date=Fall 2005 |doi=10.3172/JIE.14.2.66}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Kåre Fog, one of the original plaintiffs. Fog reasserted his contention that, despite the ministry's decision, most of the accusations against Lomborg were valid. He also rejected what he called &quot;the [[Galileo affair|Galileo]] hypothesis&quot;, which he describes as the conception that Lomborg is just a brave young man confronting old-fashioned opposition.

== Further career ==

=== Government work ===
In March 2002, the newly elected [[Centre-right|center-right]] [[prime minister]], [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]], appointed Lomborg to run Denmark's new [[Environmental Assessment Institute]] (EAI). On 22 June 2004, Lomborg announced his decision to resign from this post to go back to the University of Aarhus, saying his work at the Institute was done and that he could better serve the public debate from the academic sector.

In 2002, Lomborg and the Environmental Assessment Institute founded the [[Copenhagen Consensus]], which seeks to establish priorities for advancing [[world|global]] welfare using methodologies based on the theory of [[welfare economics]]. A panel of prominent [[economics|economists]] was assembled to evaluate and rank a series of problems every four years. The project was funded largely by the Danish government, and co-sponsored by ''[[The Economist]]''. A book summarizing the conclusions of the economists' first assessment, ''[[Global Crises, Global Solutions]]'', edited by Lomborg, was published in October 2004 by [[Cambridge University Press]].

In 2006, Lomborg became director of the new [[Copenhagen Consensus Center]], a Danish government-funded institute intended to build on the mandate of the Environmental Assessment Institute, and expand on the original Copenhagen Consensus conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/our-story | title=Our story | publisher=Copenhagen Consensus Center | accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Further books ===
''Solutions for the World's Biggest Problems'', published in 2007, offers an &quot;...&amp;nbsp;overview of twenty-three of the world's biggest problems relating to the environment, governance, economics, and health and population. Leading economists provide a short survey of the state-of-the-art analysis and sketch out some policy solutions for which they provide cost-benefit ratios.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Solutions for the World's Biggest Problems: costs and benefits|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-521-71597-3|oclc=165408072}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming]]'', also published in 2007, argues against taking immediate and &quot;drastic&quot; action to curb greenhouse gases while simultaneously stating that &quot;Global warming is happening. It's a serious and important problem&amp;nbsp;...&quot;. He argues that &quot;...&amp;nbsp;the cost and benefits of the proposed measures against global warming. ...&amp;nbsp;is the worst way to spend our money. Climate change is a 100-year problem&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; we should not try to fix it in 10 years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Cool It: The Skeptical Environmentalist's Guide to Global Warming|publisher=Cyan and Marshall Cavendish|year=2007|isbn=978-0-462-09912-5|oclc=271251227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Howard Friel]] wrote a book entitled ''The Lomborg Deception'', which criticizes Lomborg, claiming that the sources Lomborg provides in the footnotes do not support—and in some cases are in direct contradiction to—Lomborg's assertions in the text of the book;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Discussions in the media ==
After the release of ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'' in 2001, Lomborg was subjected to intense scrutiny and criticism in the [[News media|media]], where his scientific qualifications and integrity were both attacked and defended. The verdict of the Danish Committees for Scientific Dishonesty fueled this debate and brought it into the spotlight of international [[mass media]]. By the end of 2003 Lomborg had become an international celebrity, with frequent appearances on radio, television and [[Publishing|print media]] around the world.
* ''[[Scientific American]]'' published strong criticism of Lomborg's book. Lomborg responded on his own [[website]], quoting the article at such length that ''Scientific American'' threatened to sue for [[copyright infringement]]. Lomborg eventually removed the rebuttal from his website; it was later published in [[PDF]] format on ''Scientific American'''s site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=00000B96-9517-1CDA-B4A8809EC588EEDF &quot;Bjørn Lomborg’s comments to the 11-page critique in January 2002 Scientific American (SA)&quot;].

Retrieved 26 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Economist]]'' defended Lomborg, claiming the panel of experts that had criticised Lomborg in ''Scientific American'' was both biased and did not actually counter Lomborg's book. ''The Economist'' argued that the panel's opinion had come under no scrutiny at all, and that Lomborg's responses had not been reported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/printedition/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=1522706 &quot;Thought control&quot;]. ''The Economist'', 9 January 2003. Retrieved 26 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!]]''&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; the U.S. [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] television programme featured an episode entitled &quot;Environmental Hysteria&quot; in which Lomborg criticised what he claimed was environmentalists' refusal to accept a [[cost-benefit analysis]] of environmental questions, and stressed the need to prioritise some issues above others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sho.com/site/ptbs/topics.do?topic=eh ''Bullshit'', &quot;Environmental Hysteria&quot;].

Cambridge University Press. Retrieved 26 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] strongly criticised ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', claiming it to be &quot;seriously flawed and failing to meet basic standards of credible scientific analysis&quot;, accusing Lomborg of presenting data in a fraudulent way, using flawed logic and selectively citing non-peer-reviewed literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;UCS&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/science_and_impacts/global_warming_contrarians/ucs-examines-the-skeptical.html|title=UCS Examines 'The Skeptical Environmentalist' |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists|accessdate=11 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review was conducted by [[Peter Gleick]], [[Jerry D. Mahlman]], [[Edward O. Wilson]], [[Thomas Lovejoy]], [[Norman Myers]], [[Jeffrey Harvey (biologist)|Jeff Harvey]], and [[Stuart Pimm]]. Lomborg countered that some of the scientists involved in this report were also named and criticised in ''The Skeptical Environmentalist'', and thus had a vested interest in discrediting it and its author.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}
