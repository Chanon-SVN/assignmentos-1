Telecommunications in Burkina Faso
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Telecommunications in Burkina Faso''' include radio, television, fixed and mobile telephones, and the Internet.

Radio is the country's most popular communications medium. Use of telecommunications in [[Burkina Faso]] are extremely low, limited due to the low penetration of electricity, even in major cities. There were just 141,400 fixed line phones in use in 2012, in a country with a population of 17.4 million. Use of mobile phones has skyrocketed from 1.0 million lines in 2006 to 10 million in 2012. Internet use is also low, with only 3.7 users per 100 inhabitants in 2012, just over 643,000 users total. The Internet penetration rate in Africa as a whole was 16 users per 100 inhabitants in 2013. 

==Regulation and control==

The constitution and law provide for [[freedom of speech]] and of the [[freedom of the press|press]], and the government generally respects these rights in practice.&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-BurkinaFaso-2012/&gt; 

All media are under the administrative and technical supervision of the Ministry of Communications, which is responsible for developing and implementing government policy on information and communication. The Superior Council of Communication (SCC), a semiautonomous body under the Office of the President, monitors the content of radio and television programs, newspapers, and Internet [[Web sites]] to ensure compliance with professional ethics standards and government policy. The SCC may summon journalists and issue warnings for subsequent violations. Hearings may concern alleged libel, disturbing the peace, inciting violence, or violations of state security.&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-BurkinaFaso-2012/&gt; 

Journalists occasionally face criminal [[libel]] prosecutions and other forms of harassment and intimidation. In addition to the prohibition against insulting the head of state, the law also prohibits the publication of shocking images and lack of respect for the deceased. Although the government does not attempt to impede criticism, some journalists practice [[self-censorship]].&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-BurkinaFaso-2012/&gt; 

The Burkinabé government, in its telecommunications development strategy, has stated its aim to make telecommunications a [[universal service]] accessible to all. A large portion of this strategy is the privatization of the National Telecommunications Office (ONATEL), with an additional focus on a rural telephony promotion project. In 2006 the government sold a 51 percent stake in the national telephone company, ONATEL, and ultimately planned to retain only a 23 percent stake in the company.&lt;ref name=CIAWFB-BurkinaFaso-2014/&gt;

Internet use is low, but the sector began to improve following installation of a 22 Mbit/s [[fiber optic]] international link, a vast improvement over the previous 128 kbit/s link. Secondary access nodes began to appear in major cities, and [[cybercafé]]s were providing Internet access to a broader spectrum of end users.{{citation needed |date=February 2014}}

ONATEL’s FasoNet is the country’s leading Internet service provider, dominating the broadband market with its [[ADSL]] and [[EV-DO]] fixed-wireless offerings.&lt;ref name=Budde-BurkinaFaso-2014&gt;[http://www.budde.com.au/Research/Burkina-Faso-Telecoms-Mobile-and-Broadband.html &quot;Burkina Faso - Telecoms, Mobile and Broadband&quot;], BuddeComm, 29 January 2014. Retrieved 11 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mobile operators are offering data services using [[GPRS]] and [[EDGE]] technology, but [[3G|third generation]] (3G) mobile broadband technology has not yet been introduced. Delays in the introduction of 3G services has, so far, limited the potential of mobile broadband. A fourth mobile license and 3G licenses for all operators are expected in 2014.&lt;ref name=Budde-BurkinaFaso-2014/&gt;

A March 2013 ITU ''Study on international Internet connectivity in sub-Saharan Africa'' reports that the Burkina Faso &quot;Internet market is not sufficiently dynamic and competitive&quot; and that the high costs for Internet capable mobile phones (more than six times the cost of a basic mobile phone) and mobile Internet subscriptions (up to seven times the cost for basic mobile) limit the number of Internet users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Regulatory-Market/Documents/IIC_Africa_Final-en.pdf ''Study on international Internet connectivity in sub-Saharan Africa''], Abossé Akue-Kpakpo, International Telecommunications Union (ITU), March 2013.

===Internet censorship and surveillance===

There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet; however, the Superior Council of Communication (SCC) monitors Internet [[Web sites]] and [[discussion forums]] to ensure compliance with existing regulations. For example, in May 2012 the SCC issued a warning to a Web site on which a user had allegedly insulted [[Blaise Compaoré|President Compaore]] in an Internet forum.&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-BurkinaFaso-2012&gt;[http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2012&amp;dlid=204094 &quot;Burkina Faso&quot;], ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012'', Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 18 April 2013. Retrieved 11 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitution and law provide for [[freedom of speech]] and of the [[freedom of the press|press]], and the government generally respects these rights in practice. The law prohibits persons from insulting the head of state or using derogatory language with respect to the office; however, individuals criticize the government publicly or privately without reprisal.&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-BurkinaFaso-2012/&gt;

The constitution and law prohibit arbitrary interference with privacy, family, home, or correspondence, and the government generally respects these prohibitions in practice. In cases of national security, however, the law permits surveillance, searches, and monitoring of telephones and private correspondence without a warrant.&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-BurkinaFaso-2012/&gt;
