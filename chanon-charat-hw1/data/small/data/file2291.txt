'''British Airways''' ('''BA''') is the [[flag carrier]] airline of the [[United Kingdom]] and its largest airline based on fleet size, international flights and international destinations. When measured by passengers carried it is second-largest, behind [[easyJet]]. The airline is based in [[Waterside (building)|Waterside]] near its main [[Airline hub|hub]] at [[London Heathrow Airport]].

A British Airways Board was established by the United Kingdom government in 1972 to manage the two nationalised airline corporations, [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] and [[British European Airways]], and two smaller, regional airlines, [[Cambrian Airways]], from [[Cardiff]], and [[Northeast Airlines (UK)|Northeast Airlines]], from [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. On 31 March 1974, all four companies were merged to form British Airways. After almost 13 years as a state company, British Airways was privatised in February 1987 as part of a wider privatisation plan by the Conservative government. The carrier soon expanded with the acquisition of [[British Caledonian]] in 1987, followed by [[Dan-Air]] in 1992 and [[British Midland International]] in 2012.

British Airways is a founding member of the [[Oneworld]] airline alliance, along with [[American Airlines]], [[Cathay Pacific]], [[Qantas]], and the now defunct [[Canadian Airlines]]. The alliance has since grown to become the third-largest, after [[SkyTeam]] and [[Star Alliance]]. British Airways merged with [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]] on 21 January 2011, formally creating the [[International Airlines Group]] (IAG), the world's third-largest airline group in terms of annual revenue and the second-largest in Europe. IAG is listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] and in the [[FTSE 100 Index]].

A long-time [[Boeing]] customer, British Airways ordered 59 [[Airbus A320 family]] aircraft in August 1998. In 2007, it purchased 12 [[Airbus A380]]s and 24 [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]s, marking the start of its [[flight length|long-haul]] fleet replacement. The centrepiece of the airline's long-haul fleet is the [[Boeing 777]]; with 58 examples in the fleet. British Airways is the largest operator of [[Boeing 747-400]] in the world with 55 registered to the airline.

==History==
{{Main|History of British Airways}}
[[File:British Airways Boeing 747-100 in BOAC basic livery Marmet.jpg|thumb|A [[Boeing 747-100]] in BOAC-British Airways transition livery]]
In January 1972 a British Airways Board was established by the UK government following the passing of the Civil Aviation Act 1971, to manage [[British Overseas Airways Corporation]] (BOAC) and [[British European Airways]] (BEA). On 1 September 1972 the management service functions of both BOAC and BEA were combined under the newly formed ''British Airways Group''.

British Airways was established as an airline on 31 March 1974 by the dissolution of BOAC and BEA.&lt;ref name = EOP7&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/history-1970-1979/public/en_gb|publisher=British Airways|title=Explore our past: 1970–1979|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following two years of fierce competition with [[British Caledonian]], the second-largest airline in Britain at the time, the Government changed its aviation policy in 1976 so that the two carriers would no longer compete on long-haul routes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1975/1975%20-%201427.html |title = UK abandons long-haul competition |work=Flight International |date = 7 August 1975 |page = 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Airways and [[Air France]] operated the [[supersonic]] airliner [[Concorde|Aerospatiale-BAC Concorde]], and the world's first [[supersonic]] passenger service flew in January 1976 from London Heathrow to [[Bahrain]].&lt;ref name = 'Concordeintro3'&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=inkRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PeADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5479,5052446&amp;dq=concorde|title=Concorde starts regular service|work=Eugene Register-Guard|date= 26 January 1976|accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Services to the US began on 24 May 1976 with a flight to [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Washington Dulles]] airport, and flights to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York JFK]] airport followed on 22 September 1977. Service to Singapore was established in co-operation with [[Singapore Airlines]] as a continuation of the flight to Bahrain.&lt;ref name = EOP7/&gt; Following the [[Air France Flight 4590|Air France Concorde crash]] in Paris and a slump in air travel following the [[11 September attacks]] in New York in 2001, it was decided to cease Concorde operations in 2003 after 27 years of service. The final commercial Concorde flight was BA002 from New York JFK to London Heathrow on 24 October 2003.&lt;ref name = EOP2000&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.britishairways.com/travel/history-2000-present/public/en_gb|title=Explore Our Past:2000 – present|work=British Airways|accessdate=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 the airline was instructed to prepare for privatisation by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Second Thatcher ministry|Thatcher]] government. [[John King, Baron King of Wartnaby|Sir John King]], later Lord King, was appointed chairman, charged with bringing the airline back into profitability. While many other large airlines struggled, King was credited with transforming British Airways into one of the most profitable air carriers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4896070.html|title=A-Z of Employers|work=The Independent | date=12 February 1998|first=Rachelle|last=Thackray|accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flag carrier was privatised and was floated on the London Stock Exchange in February 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/danair-swallowed-up-by-ba-rivals-say-competition-and-choice-will-be-cut-by-takeover-that-will-axe-1900-jobs-1559258.html|title=After much fanfare, sale of British Airways set to begin|work=The Independent | accessdate=10 February 1987|last=Marshall|first=Tyler | date=24 October 1992 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; British Airways effected the takeover of Britain's &quot;second&quot; airline, British Caledonian, in July of that same year.&lt;ref name = BAP&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/history-1980-1989/public/en_gb|work=British Airways|title=Explore our past: 1980–1989|accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of [[Richard Branson]]'s [[Virgin Atlantic|Virgin Atlantic Airways]] in 1984 created a competitor for BA. The intense rivalry between British Airways and Virgin Atlantic culminated in the former being sued for libel in 1993, arising from claims and counter claims over a &quot;dirty tricks&quot; campaign against Virgin. This campaign included allegations of poaching Virgin Atlantic customers, tampering with private files belonging to Virgin and undermining Virgin's reputation in the City. As a result of the case BA management apologised &quot;unreservedly&quot;, and the company agreed to pay £110,000 damages to Virgin, £500,000 to Branson personally and £3&amp;nbsp;million legal costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;dirtytricks&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=BA dirty tricks against Virgin cost £3m|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/11/newsid_2520000/2520189.stm|publisher=BBC: On This Day|date=11 January 1993|accessdate=23 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord King stepped down as chairman in 1993 and was replaced by his deputy, Colin Marshall, while [[Robert Ayling|Bob Ayling]] took over as CEO.&lt;ref name = EOP9/&gt; Virgin filed a separate action in the US that same year regarding BA's domination of the trans-Atlantic routes, but it was thrown out in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;dirtytricks&quot; /&gt;

In 1992 British Airways expanded through the acquisition of the financially troubled [[Dan-Air]], giving BA a much larger presence at Gatwick airport. [[British Asia Airways]], a subsidiary based in Taiwan, was formed in March 1993 to operate between London and [[Taipei]]. That same month BA purchased a 25% stake in the Australian airline [[Qantas]] and, with the acquisition of [[Brymon Airways]] in May, formed British Airways Citiexpress (later [[BA Connect]]).&lt;ref name = EOP9&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/history-1990-1999/public/en_gb|work=British Airways|title=Explore our past: 1990–1999|accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1998, British Airways, along with [[American Airlines]], [[Cathay Pacific]], Qantas, and [[Canadian Airlines]], formed the [[Oneworld]] [[airline alliance]]. Oneworld began operations on 1 February 1999, and is the third largest airline alliance in the world, behind [[SkyTeam]] and Star Alliance.&lt;ref name = BAP/&gt;

Bob Ayling's leadership led to a cost savings of £750m and the establishment of a budget airline, [[Go (airline)|Go]], in 1998.&lt;ref name=aylingquits&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/11/business/international-business-british-airways-ousts-chief-after-four-tumultuous-years.html|title=International Business; British Airways Ousts Chief After Four Tumultuous Years|work=The New York Times|accessdate=13 June 2009| date=11 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, however, British Airways reported an 84% drop in profits in its first quarter alone, its worst in seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/29/business/market-insight-seeing-fool-s-gold-in-airlines-cheap-seats.html|title=Market Insight: Seeing Fool's Gold In Airlines' Cheap Seats|work=The New York Times|date=29 August 1999|last=Sorkin|first=Andrew|accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2000, Ayling was removed from his position and British Airways announced [[Rod Eddington]] as his successor.

British Airways' main base is at London Heathrow Airport, but it also has a major presence at [[Gatwick Airport]]. It also has a base at [[London City Airport]] (LCY), where its subsidiary [[BA CityFlyer]] is the largest operator. BA had previously operated a significant hub at [[Manchester Airport]]. Manchester operations ceased, along with all international services outside of London, when the subsidiary [[BA Connect]] was sold due to a lack of profitability. Passengers wishing to travel internationally with BA either to or from regional UK destinations must now transfer in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Flights hit by BA sale to Flybe |date=5 March 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6418391.stm|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heathrow Airport is dominated by British Airways, which owns 40% of the slots available at the airport.&lt;ref name='slotsref'&gt;{{Cite news|first=David|last=Gow|title=BA outbid for Heathrow slots|date=21 January 2004|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2004/jan/21/theairlineindustry.britishairways|work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=23 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of BA services operate from [[London Heathrow Terminal 5|Terminal 5]], with the exception of some short-haul and mid-haul flights at [[London Heathrow Terminal 1|Terminal 1]] arising from the purchase of BMI and some short-haul flights at [[London Heathrow Terminal 3|Terminal 3]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/flight-information/destinations-and-airlines |title=Destinations and airlines |accessdate=6 July 2013 |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; owing to a lack of capacity at Terminal 5. With the imminent opening of the brand-new Terminal 2 in 2014, Star Alliance airlines will progressively be moving all their services into the new terminal and Terminal 1 will be closed for demolition in due course. British Airways' services will then be concentrated in Terminals 3 and 5. 

In August 2014 Willie Walsh advised the airline would continue to use flight paths over Iraq despite the hostilities there. A few days earlier Qantas announced it would avoid Iraqi airspace, while other airlines did likewise. The issue arose following the downing of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]] over Ukraine, and a temporary suspension of flights to and from [[Ben Gurion Airport]] during the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict]].&lt;ref name=&quot;IraqBA&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=British Airways CEO insists flights over Iraq are safe|url=http://www.theuknews.com/index.php/sid/224382415/scat/0f440bf3fff89f01/ht/British-Airways-CEO-insists-flights-over-Iraq-are-safe|accessdate=2 August 2014|publisher=''The UK News''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial relations===
Staff working for British Airways are represented by a number of trade unions, pilots are represented by [[British Air Line Pilots' Association]], cabin crew by [[British Airlines Stewards and Stewardesses Association]] (a branch of [[Unite the Union]]), while other branches of Unite the Union and the [[GMB Union]] represent other employees. Bob Ayling's management faced strike action by cabin crew over a £1 billion cost-cutting drive to return BA to profitability in 1997; this was the last time BA cabin crew would strike until 2009, although staff morale has reportedly been unstable since that incident.&lt;ref name = CCSA&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/dec/15/british-airways-strike-background|work=The Guardian |title=BA strike: conflict that was always on airline's flight path|date=15 December 2009|accessdate=4 July 2010|location=London|first=Dan|last=Milmo}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to increase interaction between management, employees, and the unions, various conferences and workshops have taken place, often with thousands in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100965480|author=Bamber, G.J., Gittell, J.H., Kochan, T.A. &amp; von Nordenflytch, A. |year=2009 |title=Up in the Air: How Airlines Can Improve Performance by Engaging their Employees|publisher=Cornell University Press, Ithaca |chapter=chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, wildcat action was taken by union members over a decision by [[Gate Gourmet]] not to renew the contracts of 670 workers and replace them with agency staff; it is estimated that the strike cost British Airways £30&amp;nbsp;million and caused disruption to 100,000 passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/4162036.stm|title=Gate Gourmet probes union claims|publisher=BBC News |date=18 August 2005|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006, BA became involved in a [[British Airways cross controversy|civil rights dispute]] when a Christian employee was forbidden to wear a necklace baring the [[christian cross|cross]], a religious symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Woman to sue BA in necklace row|publisher=BBC News |date=15 October 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/6052608.stm|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; BA's practice of forbidding such symbols has been publicly questioned by British politicians such as the former [[Home Secretary]] [[John Reid, Baron Reid of Cardowan|John Reid]] and the former [[Foreign Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Lucy |last = Cockcroft |url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/7028261/BA-wrong-to-ban-Christian-from-wearing-cross-because-it-plays-into-extremists-hands.html |title = BA 'wrong' to ban Christian from wearing cross because it 'plays into extremists' hands' |work = The Telegraph |date = 19 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Jane |last = Merrick |author2= Sam Greenhill |url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-418268/Jack-Straw-joins-chorus-condemnation-BAs-cross-ban.html |title = Jack Straw joins chorus of condemnation over BA's 'cross' ban |work=Daily Mail |date = 24 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations have been turbulent between BA and Unite. In 2007, cabin crew threatened strike action over salary changes to be imposed by BA management. The strike was called off at the last minute, British Airways losing £80&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name = CCSA/&gt; In December 2009, a ballot for strike action over Christmas received a high level of support,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8411214.stm|title=British Airways cabin crew vote for Christmas strike |publisher=BBC News |date=14 December 2009|accessdate=24 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; action was blocked by a court injunction that deemed the ballot illegal.

==Fleet==
[[File:British Airways Boeing 787-8 G-ZBJB.jpg|thumb|A Boeing 787-8 landing at [[Toronto-Pearson Airport]]]]
With the exception of the [[Boeing 707]] and early [[Boeing 747]] variants from BOAC, British Airways inherited a mainly UK-built fleet of aircraft when it was formed in 1974. The airline introduced the [[Boeing 737]] and [[Boeing 757]] into the fleet in the 1980s, followed by the Boeing 747-400, [[Boeing 767]] and [[Boeing 777]] in the 1990s. BA is now the largest operator of Boeing 747-400s, with 55 in its fleet.&lt;ref name = BAP/&gt;&lt;ref name = EOP9/&gt; Prior to the introduction of the 787, when Boeing built an aircraft for British Airways, it was allocated the [[List of Boeing customer codes|customer code]] ''36'', which appeared in their aircraft designation as a suffix, such as 737–436.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caa.co.uk/application.aspx?catid=60&amp;pagetype=65&amp;appid=1&amp;mode=summary&amp;aircrafttype=Boeing&amp;owner=British%20Airways|title=CAA Aircraft Register (Boeing aircraft registered to British Airways)|work=Civil Aviation Authority|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, British Airways placed its first order for 777-200 aircraft, ordering another four for fleet expansion in 2007 at a cost of around US$800&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-30158167_ITM|title=Boeing and British Airways complete deal for four 777-200ERs; Boeing 777 is logical complement to British Airways' wide-body fleet|work=M2 Presswire|date=28 March 2007|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; BA's first 777s were fitted with [[General Electric GE90]] engines, but BA switched to [[Rolls-Royce Trent 800]]s for subsequent aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60879579.html|title=Rolls-Royce lands US jets deal|work=Birmingham Evening Mail|accessdate=18 August 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-06/rolls-royce-wins-british-airways-order-for-trent-plane-engines.html|title=British Airways Picks Troubled Rolls Engine for A380s |author=Howard Mustoe, Steve Rothwell |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=15 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A380 &amp; Red Arrows - RIAT 2013.jpg|thumb|left|G-XLEA, British Airways' first Airbus A380, accompanied by the [[Red Arrows]] at 2013 [[Royal International Air Tattoo]]]]
Later in 2007, BA announced their order of thirty-six new long-haul aircraft, including twelve [[Airbus A380]]s and twenty-four [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]s.&lt;ref name='baorder'&gt;{{Cite news|title=BA opts for A380 and Dreamliner|date=27 September 2007|publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7015621.stm|accessdate=27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rolls-Royce Trent]] engines were again selected for both orders with Trent 900s powering the A380s and Trent 1000s powering the 787s. The Boeing 787s will replace 14 of British Airways' Boeing 767 fleet, while the Airbus A380s will replace 20 of BA's Boeing 747-400s and will most likely be used to increase capacity on key routes from London Heathrow.

On 1 August 2008, BA announced orders for six Boeing 777-300ERs and options for four more as an interim measure to cover for delays over the deliveries of their 787-8/9s. Of the six that have been ordered, four will be leased and two will be fully acquired by British Airways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/money/2008/08/01/bcnba301.xml|title=BA warns that ticket prices will jump as routes are axed|last=Dunkley|first=Jamie|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=1 August 2008|accessdate=1 August 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 April 2013, IAG confirmed that it had signed a memorandum of understanding to order 18 A350-1000 aircraft for British Airways, with an option for a further 18. The aircraft would replace some of the airline's fleet of Boeing 747-400s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/iag-to-order-18-a350s-for-ba-384980/ |title=IAG to order 18 A350s for BA |publisher=Flightglobal.com |date=2013-04-22 |accessdate=2014-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Options for 18 Boeing 787 aircraft, part of the original contract signed in 2007, have been converted into firm orders for delivery between 2017 and 2021.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Airbus A350 for British Airways | journal = Airliner World | pages = p5 | date = June 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June 2013, British Airways took delivery of its first 787s. The aircraft began operations to Toronto on 1 September 2013, and began service to Newark on 1 October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2013/09/02/ba_dreamliner_completes_inaugural_londontoronto_flight.html|title=BA Dreamliner completes inaugural London-Toronto flight |last=Ellison|first=Marc|work=Toronto Star|date=2 September 2013|accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; BA's first A380 was delivered on 4 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-23177384|title=BA's first A380 superjumbo arrives at Heathrow airport|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=4 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began regular services to Los Angeles on 24 September 2013, followed by Hong Kong on 22 October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wall |first=Robert |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-05/british-airways-to-operate-first-a380s-to-los-angeles-hong-kong.html |title=British Airways to Fly First A380s to Los Angeles, Hong Kong |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The combined International Airlines Group entity (that BA is now a part of), operates around 400 aircraft, carries over 62&amp;nbsp;million passengers annually, and serves more than 200 destinations.&lt;ref name = BAIM/&gt;

;British Airways World Cargo Fleet
IAG's cargo division, [[IAG Cargo]], handles cargo operations using capacity on British Airways' passenger aircraft. [[Global Supply Systems]] operated three [[Boeing 747-8F]] aircraft under a [[wet lease]] arrangement for British Airways World Cargo until BA terminated the contract early on 17 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Rohit T.K. |date=17 January 2014 |title=Atlas Air loses contract with British Airways, shares dive |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/17/us-atlasair-britishairways-idUSBREA0G11R20140117 |agency=Reuters |accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An agreement with Qatar Airways to operate flights for IAG Cargo using [[Boeing 777F]] was announced on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iagcargo.com/iagcargo/portlet/en/html/noticiasMenu/main/view |title=IAG Cargo signs freight deal with Qatar Airways |date=17 January 2014 |publisher=IAG Cargo |accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Airways Engineering===
The company has its own [[British Airways Engineering|engineering branch]] to maintain its aircraft fleet, this includes line maintenance at over 70 airports around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/baengineeringmaintenance/public/en_gb |title=British Airways Engineering |publisher=Britishairways.com |accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as hangar facilities at Heathrow and Gatwick airport it has two major maintenance centres at [[Glasgow Airport|Glasgow]] and [[British Airways Maintenance Cardiff|Cardiff Airports]] and a facility at [[Prestwick Airport]] that was treating wing skin corrosion on A318, A319, A320 and A321 aircraft, until 2014. Since January 2012 most heavy maintenance on the Boeing 737-400 Gatwick-based fleet was done at the [[Lufthansa Technik]] maintenance facility in [[Sofia]], Bulgaria until early 2014 when KLM Engineering in Norwich got the contract

===Branding===
[[File:British Airways at Terminal 5 in 2011.jpg|thumb|right|British Airways' promotional banner above the check in desks at [[London Heathrow Terminal 5|Terminal 5]]]]

The musical theme predominantly used on British Airways advertising is ''&quot;[[The Flower Duet]]&quot;'' by [[Léo Delibes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chrisworthproductions.com/track_details.php?id=858|title=Flower Duet (From Lakme) by Leo Delibes|work=Chris Worth Productions|accessdate=8 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, and the slogan &quot;The World's Favourite Airline&quot; were introduced in 1989 with the launch of the iconic [[British Airways face advertisement|&quot;Face&quot; advertisement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxs106rp5RQ|title=1989 British Airways Commercial|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=19 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slogan was dropped in 2001 after Lufthansa overtook BA in terms of passenger numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=British Airways takes off|date=22 May 2001|url=http://money.cnn.com/2001/05/22/europe/ba/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Flower Duet&quot; is still used by the airline, and has been through several different arrangements since 1989. The most recent version of this melody was shown in 2007 with a new slogan: &quot;Upgrade to British Airways&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upgradetobritishairways.ba.com/|title=BA official website – &quot;Upgrade to British Airways&quot; homepage|work=British Airways|accessdate=14 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other advertising slogans have included &quot;The World's Best Airline&quot;, &quot;We'll Take More Care of You&quot;, and &quot;Fly the Flag&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/smgpubs/access/41000627.html?dids=41000627:41000627&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+30%2C+1999&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Herald&amp;desc=BA+slogan+out+of+favour&amp;pqatl=google |title = BA slogan out of favour |work = The Herald |date = 30 April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BA had an account for 23 years with [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]], an agency that created many of their most famous advertisements, including the influential &quot;Face&quot; campaign. Saatchi &amp; Saatchi later imitated this advert for [[Silverjet]], a rival of BA, after BA discontinued their business activities.&lt;ref name = SJA&gt;{{Cite news|title=Saatchi ad gets revenge on BA|date=5 October 2007|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/oct/05/advertising|work=The Guardian |location=UK |first=Mark|last=Sweney|accessdate=28 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007 BA has used [[Bartle Bogle Hegarty]] as its advertising agency.&lt;ref name='adref'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleboglehegarty.com/Europe/Clients+Work.aspx|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070211202941/http://www.bartleboglehegarty.com/Europe/Clients+Work.aspx|archivedate=11 February 2007|title=Clients &amp; Work|work=Bartle Bogle Hegarty|accessdate=27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Airways purchased the [[internet domain]] ba.com in 2002 from previous owner [[Bell Atlantic]], 'BA' being the company's acronym and its [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] Airline code. In 2011 BA launched its biggest advertising campaign in a decade, including a 90-second cinematic advert celebrating the airline's ninety-year heritage and a new slogan &quot;To Fly. To Serve&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2039678/British-Airways-relaunches-new-slogan-nods-imperial-origins.html |title=British Airways relaunches itself with new slogan that nods to its imperial origins |author=Ray Massey |work=Daily Mail |date=21 September 2011 |accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Airways is the official airline of the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon Championship tennis tournament]], and was the official airline and tier one partner of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] and [[2012 Summer Paralympics|Paralympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agency.com/facts/press_release.asp?pid=63|publisher=Agency.com|title=British Airways Reminds Visitors to Leave Air Horn, Chili Dog at Home During Wimbledon|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=British Airways – official airline partner of London 2012 |accessdate=22 June 2010 |url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/london-2012/public/en_gb|work=British Airways}}&lt;/ref&gt; British Airways was also the official airline of England's bid to host the [[2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids|2018 Football World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=BA part of 2018 World Cup History |date=27 April 2010 |url=http://www.england2018bid.com/news/223/ba-part-of-2018-world-cup-history.aspx|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liveries and tail fins===
{{further2|[[British Airways ethnic liveries]]}}
[[File:Animalstrees.jpg|thumb|A British Airways Boeing 747-400 with a Utopia fin]]
Since its formation in 1974, British Airways' aeroplanes carried a [[Union Jack]] scheme painted on their tail fins. The original tail scheme was changed in 1984 as part of a new livery designed by [[Landor Associates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Ray |last = Moseley |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/474804971.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+12%2C+1986&amp;author=Ray+Moseley+Chicago+Tribune&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;desc=British+Airways+scores+big+profit+turnaraound&amp;pqatl=google |title=British Airways scores big profit turnaraound |work=Chicago Tribune |date= 12 January 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, there was a controversial change from the use of the former British Airways branding (which incorporated stylised elements of the Union flag) to a new livery which was intended mainly to reflect the diversity of places served by the airline – so-called &quot;World Images&quot;. This involved a range of different designs appearing on tailfins and elsewhere, although the bodies of all the planes would use the corporate colours consistently; the exception was the Concorde fleet, which would have a new tailfin design based on a stylised, fluttering Union flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/by-their-tailfins-shall-we-know-them-1256015.html|title=By their tailfins shall we know them?|work=The Independent |date=15 June 1997|first=Hugh|last=Aldersey-Williams|accessdate=28 June 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; What became known as the &quot;ethnic images&quot; included Delftware or Chinese calligraphy, related to countries on the company's network of routes. This was reported to have caused problems with [[air traffic control]]: previously controllers had been able to tell pilots to follow a BA plane, but they were now harder to visually identify.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/people--business-1155362.html|title=People &amp; Business|work=The Independent |date=9 April 1998|first=John|last=Willcock|accessdate=28 June 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several people spoke out against the change, including the former Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1324788.stm |title=BA turns tail on colours |publisher=BBC News |date=11 May 2001 |accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; BA's traditional rival, Virgin Atlantic, took advantage of the negative press coverage by applying the Union flag to the winglets of their aircraft along with the slogan &quot;Britain's national flagcarrier&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-60450784.html|title=Tony Parsons' column: Don't Jack it in yet|work=The Mirror|date=14 June 1999|last=Parsons|first=Tony|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 the CEO of British Airways, Bob Ayling, announced that all BA planes would adopt the tailfin design originally intended to be used only on the Concorde, based on the Union Flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/union-jack-is-back-on-the-worlds-favourite-airline-1098648.html|title=Union Jack is back on the world's favourite airline|work=The Independent |date=7 June 1999|accessdate=28 June 2010 | location=London | first=Warwick | last=Mansell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loyalty programmes===
British Airways' tiered loyalty programme, called the Executive Club, includes access to special lounges and dedicated &quot;fast&quot; queues.&lt;ref name=execclub&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/money/consumer_affairs/article711216.ece|title=Now you can fly further with air loyalty plans|work=The Times |accessdate=13 June 2009| first=Jessica | last=Bown | date=30 April 2006 | location=London}}
&lt;/ref&gt; BA also invites its top corporate accounts to join a &quot;Premier&quot; incentive programme. British Airways operates airside lounges for passengers travelling in premium cabins, and these are available to certain tiers of Executive Club members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/lounges/public/en_gb|title=Lounges|work=British Airways|accessdate=17 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; First class passengers, as well as Gold Executive Club members, are entitled to use First Class Lounges.

All flights into Gatwick are operated by Boeing 737-400, Airbus A319 or A320 aircraft in a one-class configuration. The 737 fleet is to be retired with the last aircraft due to leave the fleet by summer 2015.&lt;ref name = ST/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishairways.com/travel/uk-domestic-seating/public/en_gb|title=UK Domestic: On-board|work=British Airways|accessdate=5 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These aircraft have been designated to serve routes such as [[Almaty]], [[Tbilisi]], [[Baku]], [[Amman]], [[Beirut]] and [[Tel Aviv]]. The 'Club World' business class on these narrowbody aircraft is different to the product operated on the rest of BA's longhaul fleet: a 1–2 configuration of 23 seats is used to allow for enough leg room and space for flat bed seats. All seats are fitted with the Thales i5000 in-flight entertainment system.

==Incidents and accidents==
* In November 1974, British Airways Flight 870 was hijacked shortly after take-off from [[Dubai]] for London Heathrow, The [[Vickers VC10]] landed at [[Tripoli]] for refuelling before flying on to Tunis. The captain, Jim Futcher, returned to the aircraft to fly it knowing the hijackers were on board. The hijackers eventually surrendered after 84 hours, but not before a hostage was murdered. Futcher was awarded the [[Queen's Gallantry Medal]], the [[Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators]] Founders Medal, the [[British Air Line Pilots Association]] Gold Medal and a Certificate of Commendation from British Airways for his actions during the hijacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?

* On 10 September 1976, a [[Hawker Siddeley Trident|Trident 3B]] on [[1976 Zagreb mid-air collision|British Airways Flight 476]] departed from London Heathrow to Istanbul. It collided in mid-air with an [[Inex Adria]] [[McDonnell-Douglas DC-9|DC9-31]] near [[Zagreb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yMUVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=4hEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6621,1799120&amp;dq=british+airways|title=Worst midair crash ever claims 176 in Yugoslavia|work=Milwaukee Sentinel|date=11 September 1976|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All 54 passengers and 9 crew members on the BA aircraft died. This is the only fatal accident to a British Airways aircraft since the company's formation in 1974.
* On 24 June 1982, [[British Airways Flight 9]], a Boeing 747-200 registration ''G-BDXH'', flew through a cloud of volcanic ash and dust from the eruption of [[Galunggung|Mount Galunggung]]. The ash and dust caused extensive damage to the aircraft, including the failure of all four engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/683277272.html?dids=683277272:683277272&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Jun+25%2C+1982&amp;author=&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Jet+Safe+After+Heart-Stopping%2C+Dead-Engine+Dive&amp;pqatl=google|title=Jet Safe After Heart-Stopping, Dead-Engine Dive|work=Los Angeles Times|date=25 June 1982|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew managed to glide the plane out of the dust cloud and restart all four of its engines, although one later had to be shut down again. The volcanic ash caused the cockpit window to be scratched to such an extent that it was not possible for the pilots to see out of the plane. However, the aircraft made a successful emergency landing at [[Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport]] just outside [[Jakarta]]. There were no fatalities or injuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Black Box&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Faith|first=Nicholas|title=Black Box|work=Boxtree|origyear=1996 |year=1998|isbn=0-7522-2118-3|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 10 June 1990, [[British Airways Flight 5390]], a [[BAC One-Eleven]] flight between [[Birmingham]] and [[Málaga]], suffered a windscreen blowout due to the fitting of incorrect bolts the previous day. The Captain, Tim Lancaster, suffered major injuries after being partially blown out of the aircraft, but the co-pilot landed the plane safely at [[Southampton Airport]]. Despite the physical trauma he suffered, Lancaster fully recovered, and five months later he returned to duty.&lt;ref name=OgdenInterview&gt;{{Cite news|title=This is your captain screaming (interview with Nigel Ogden)|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=5 February 2005|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/This-is-your-captain-screaming/2005/02/04/1107476802601.html|accessdate=21 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 2 August 1990, [[British Airways Flight 149]] landed at [[Kuwait International Airport]] four hours after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The aircraft, a Boeing 747-100, registration G-AWND, was destroyed, and all passengers and crew were captured. Two of the landing gears were salvaged, and are on display in Waterside, BA Headquarters in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/395492.stm|title=BA loses Iraq hostage appeal|publisher=BBC News |date=15 July 1999 | accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6055048.stm|title=UK hostages describe Kuwait ordeal|publisher=BBC News |date=16 October 2006 | accessdate=2 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BA38 Crash.jpg|thumb|The damaged British Airways Flight 38]]
* On 29 December 2000, [[British Airways Flight 2069]] was en route from London to Nairobi when a mentally-ill passenger entered the cockpit and grabbed the controls. As the pilots struggled to remove the intruder, the [[Boeing 747-400]] stalled twice and banked to 94 degrees. Several people on board were injured by the violent manoeuvres which briefly caused the aircraft to descend at 30,000 ft per minute. The man was finally restrained with the help of several passengers and the co-pilot regained control. The flight landed safely in Nairobi.
* On 17 January 2008, [[British Airways Flight 38]], a [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]] ''G-YMMM'', departed from [[Beijing Capital International Airport|Beijing]] to London. It crash-landed approximately {{convert|1000|ft|m}} short of London Heathrow Airport's runway 27L and slid onto the runway's [[displaced threshold]]. The damage to the landing gear, the wing roots and the engines, resulted in the first hull loss of a Boeing 777. There were no fatalities, but there was one serious injury and twelve minor injuries.
&lt;!--PLEASE SEE the discussion at WT:AV re the INCIDENT ON 24 MAY before adding it here--&gt;
*On 22 December 2013, British Airways Flight 34, a Boeing 747–436 ''G-BNLL'', hit a building at [[O. R. Tambo International Airport]] in [[Johannesburg]] after missing a turning on a taxiway. The starboard wing was severely damaged but there were no injuries amongst the crew or 189 passengers, however four members of ground staff were injured when the wing smashed into the building.&lt;ref name=Tel10534084&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/10534084/British-Airways-plane-collides-with-building-at-Johannesburg-airport.html |title=British Airways plane collides with building at Johannesburg airport |publisher=Telegraph Group |date=22 December 2013 |accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft was officially withdrawn from service in February 2014.&lt;ref name=BASourceBNLL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebasource.com/british-airways-b747-400-g-bnll-officially-withdrawn/ |title=British Airways B747-400 G-BNLL Officially Withdrawn. |publisher=The BA Source |date=22 February 2014 |accessdate=23 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
