The '''Boeing 767''' is a mid- to large-size, [[flight duration|long-range]], [[Wide-body aircraft|wide-body]] twin-engine [[jet airliner]] built by [[Boeing Commercial Airplanes]]. It was the manufacturer's first wide-body [[twinjet]] and its first airliner with a two-crew [[glass cockpit]]. The aircraft has two [[turbofan]] engines, a conventional [[tailplane|tail]], and, for reduced [[aerodynamic drag]], a [[supercritical airfoil|supercritical wing]] design. Designed as a smaller wide-body airliner than earlier aircraft such as the [[Boeing 747|747]], the 767 has seating capacity for 181 to 375 persons and a [[Range (aircraft)|design range]] of {{Convert|3850|to|6385|nmi|km|lk=in}}, depending on variant. Development of the 767 occurred in tandem with a [[Narrow-body aircraft|narrow-body]] twinjet, the [[Boeing 757|757]], resulting in shared design features which allow pilots to obtain a common [[type rating]] to operate both aircraft.

The 767 is produced in three [[fuselage]] lengths. The original 767-200 entered service in 1982, followed by the 767-300 in 1986 and the 767-400ER, an extended-range (ER) variant, in 2000. The extended-range 767-200ER and 767-300ER models entered service in 1984 and 1988, respectively, while a production [[Cargo aircraft|freighter]] version, the 767-300F, debuted in 1995. Conversion programs have modified passenger 767-200 and 767-300 series aircraft for cargo use, while military derivatives include the [[Boeing E-767|E-767]] [[Airborne early warning and control|surveillance]] aircraft, the [[Boeing KC-767|KC-767]] and [[Boeing KC-46|KC-46]] aerial [[aerial refueling|tankers]], and VIP transports. Engines featured on the 767 include the [[General Electric CF6]], [[Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D]] and [[Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000|PW4000]], and [[Rolls-Royce RB211]] turbofans.

[[United Airlines]] first placed the 767 in commercial service in 1982. The aircraft was initially flown on domestic and [[Transcontinental flight across the United States|transcontinental]] routes, during which it demonstrated the reliability of its twinjet design. In 1985, the 767 became the first twin-engined airliner to receive regulatory approval for extended overseas flights. The aircraft was then used to expand [[Non-stop flight|non-stop]] service on [[Flight length|medium- to long-haul]] intercontinental routes. In 1986, Boeing initiated studies for a higher-capacity 767, ultimately leading to the development of the [[Boeing 777|777]], a larger wide-body twinjet. In the 1990s, the 767 became the most frequently used airliner for [[transatlantic flight]]s between North America and Europe.

The 767 is the first twinjet wide-body type to reach 1,000 aircraft delivered.  As of November 2014, Boeing has received 1,114 orders for the 767 from 74 customers; 1,066 have been delivered.  A total of 795 of these aircraft were in service in July 2014; the most popular variant is the 767-300ER, with 583 delivered; [[Delta Air Lines]] is the largest operator, with 95 aircraft. Competitors have included the [[Airbus A300]], [[Airbus A310|A310]], and [[Airbus A330|A330-200]], while a successor, the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner|787 Dreamliner]], entered service in October 2011.

==Development==

===Background===
In 1970, Boeing's 747 became the first wide-body jetliner to enter service.&lt;ref name=Eden_p102/&gt; The 747 was the first passenger jet that was wide enough to feature a twin-aisle cabin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sutter|2006|p=103.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two years later, the manufacturer began a development study, code-named 7X7, for a new wide-body aircraft intended to replace the [[Boeing 707|707]] and other early generation narrow-body jets.&lt;ref name=n157/&gt;&lt;ref name=saver/&gt; The aircraft would also provide twin-aisle seating, but in a smaller fuselage than the existing 747, [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10]], and [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]] wide-bodies.&lt;ref name=n157/&gt; To defray the high cost of development, Boeing signed risk-sharing agreements with Italian corporation [[Aeritalia]] and the Civil Transport Development Corporation (CTDC), a consortium of Japanese aerospace companies.&lt;ref name=n156&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|p=156.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the manufacturer's first major international joint venture, and both Aeritalia and the CTDC received supply contracts in return for their early participation.&lt;ref name=n156/&gt; The initial 7X7 was conceived as a [[STOL|short take-off and landing]] airliner intended for short-distance flights, but customers were unenthusiastic about the concept, leading to its redefinition as a mid-size, transcontinental-range airliner.&lt;ref name=n157&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|pp=156–57.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage the proposed aircraft featured two or three engines, with possible configurations including over-wing engines and a [[T-tail]].&lt;ref name=Eden_p102&gt;{{harvnb|Eden|2008|pp=102–03.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Delta Air Lines Boeing 767-232 Farnborough 1982 Fitzgerald.jpg|thumb|The 7X7 would make its [[Farnborough Airshow]] debut in 1982 as the 767-200.|alt=Side view of twin-engine jet touching down on runway, with deployed flaps and thrust reversers.]]

By 1976, a twinjet layout, similar to the one which had debuted on the [[Airbus A300]], became the baseline configuration.&lt;ref name=no20/&gt; The decision to use two engines reflected increased industry confidence in the reliability and economics of new-generation jet powerplants.&lt;ref name=no20&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|pp=20–21.}}&lt;/ref&gt; While airline requirements for new wide-body aircraft remained ambiguous,&lt;ref name=no20/&gt; the 7X7 was generally focused on mid-size, high-density markets.&lt;ref name=Eden_p102/&gt; As such, it was intended to transport large numbers of passengers between major cities.&lt;ref name=Eden_p103&gt;{{harvnb|Eden|2008|p=103.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advancements in civil aerospace technology, including [[high-bypass turbofan|high-bypass-ratio turbofan]] engines, new flight deck systems, [[aerodynamic]] improvements, and lighter construction materials were to be applied to the 7X7.&lt;ref name=n157/&gt;&lt;ref name=no19&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|pp=18–19.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid-size narrow-body airliner, code-named 7N7, which would become the 757.&lt;ref name=no19/&gt; Work on both proposals proceeded through the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=davies103&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2000|p=103.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=n143/&gt;

In January 1978, Boeing announced a major extension of its [[Boeing Everett Factory|Everett factory]]—which was then dedicated to the manufacture of the 747—to accommodate its new wide-body family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Birtles|1999|p=8.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1978, the new jetliner received the 767 model designation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Becher|1999|p=24.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and three variants were planned: a 767-100 with 190 seats, a 767-200 with 210 seats, and a [[trijet]] 767MR/LR version with 200 seats intended for intercontinental routes.&lt;ref name=no20/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Donald|1997|page= 173.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 767MR/LR was subsequently renamed 777 for differentiation purposes.&lt;ref name=n159&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|pp=159–60.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 767 was officially launched on July 14, 1978, when United Airlines ordered 30 of the 767-200 variant, followed by 50 more 767-200 orders from [[American Airlines]] and Delta Air Lines later that year.&lt;ref name=n159/&gt; The 767-100 was ultimately not offered for sale, as its capacity was too close to the 757's seating,&lt;ref name=n159/&gt; while the 777 trijet was eventually dropped in favor of standardizing around the twinjet configuration.&lt;ref name=no20/&gt;

===Design effort===

In the late 1970s, [[operating cost]] replaced capacity as the primary factor in airliner purchases.&lt;ref name=saver/&gt; As a result, the 767's design process emphasized [[fuel efficiency]] from the outset.&lt;ref name=n157/&gt; Boeing targeted a 20 to 30&amp;nbsp;percent cost saving over earlier aircraft, mainly through new engine and wing technology.&lt;ref name=saver&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1981/1981%20-%202612.html |title=Boeing 767: The new fuel saver |date=August 8, 1981 |last=Velupillai |first=David |work=Flight International |accessdate=July 30, 2011 |pages=436–37, 439, 440–41, 445–48, 453}}&lt;/ref&gt; As development progressed, engineers used [[computer-aided design]] for over one-third of the 767's design drawings,&lt;ref name=saver/&gt; and performed 26,000 hours of [[wind tunnel]] tests.&lt;ref name=n159/&gt; Design work occurred concurrently with the 757 twinjet, leading Boeing to treat both as almost one program to reduce risk and cost.&lt;ref name=no19/&gt;&lt;ref name=n143&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|p=143.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both aircraft would ultimately receive shared design features, including [[avionics]], [[flight management system]]s, instruments, and handling characteristics.&lt;ref name=no23/&gt; Combined development costs were estimated at $3.5 to $4&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=saver/&gt;

[[File:Continental Airlines Boeing 767-400ER Wallner.jpg|thumb|left|Forward view of a [[Continental Airlines]] 767-400ER, showing fuselage profile, [[Dihedral (aircraft)|wing dihedral]], and [[General Electric CF6|CF6]] engines|alt=Forward view of aircraft, showing fuselage profile, two circular engines.]]

Early 767 customers were given the choice of Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D or General Electric CF6 turbofans, marking the first time that Boeing had offered more than one engine option at the launch of a new airliner.&lt;ref name=no22/&gt; Both jet engine models had a maximum output of {{convert|48000|lbf|kN}} of [[Jet engine#Thrust|thrust]].&lt;ref name=Eden_p103/&gt; The engines were mounted approximately one-third the length of the wing from the fuselage, similar to previous wide-body trijets.&lt;ref name=saver/&gt; The larger wings were designed using an [[supercritical airfoil|aft-loaded]] shape which reduced aerodynamic drag and distributed [[lift (force)|lift]] more evenly across their surface span than any of the manufacturer's previous aircraft.&lt;ref name=saver/&gt;&lt;ref name=n160/&gt; The wings provided higher-altitude [[Cruise (flight)|cruise]] performance, added fuel capacity, and expansion room for future stretched variants.&lt;ref name=n159/&gt; The initial 767-200 was designed for sufficient range to fly across North America or across the northern Atlantic,&lt;ref name=Sutter_p241&gt;{{harvnb|Sutter|2006|pp=241–46.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would be capable of operating routes up to {{convert|3850|nmi|km}}.&lt;ref name=h43&gt;{{harvnb|Haenggi|2003|pp=43–44.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 767's fuselage width was set midway between that of the 707 and the 747 at {{convert|16.5|ft|m|sigfig=3}}.&lt;ref name=n157/&gt; While it was narrower than previous wide-body designs, seven abreast seating with two aisles could be fitted, and the reduced width produced less aerodynamic drag.&lt;ref name=Eden_p103/&gt;&lt;ref name=no22&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|pp=21–22.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the fuselage was not wide enough to accommodate two standard LD3 wide-body [[unit load device]]s side-by-side.&lt;ref name=Haenggi_p29&gt;{{harvnb|Haenggi|2003|p=29.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Birtles|1999|p=14.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a smaller container, the LD2,&lt;ref name=767_airport_report/&gt; was created specifically for the 767.&lt;ref name=n158&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|p=158.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The adoption of a conventional tail design also allowed the rear fuselage to be tapered over a shorter section,&lt;ref name=no22/&gt; providing for parallel aisles along the full length of the passenger cabin, and eliminating irregular seat rows toward the rear of the aircraft.&lt;ref name=saver/&gt;&lt;ref name=no22/&gt;

The 767 was the first Boeing wide-body to be designed with a two-crew digital glass cockpit.&lt;ref name=no23&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|p=23.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cathode ray tube]] (CRT) color displays and new electronics replaced the role of the [[flight engineer]] by enabling the pilot and co-pilot to monitor aircraft systems directly.&lt;ref name=no23/&gt; Despite the promise of reduced crew costs, United Airlines initially demanded a conventional three-person cockpit, citing concerns about the risks associated with introducing a new aircraft.&lt;ref name=2crew/&gt; The carrier maintained this position until July 1981, when a U.S. presidential task force determined that a crew of two was safe for operating wide-body jets.&lt;ref name=2crew&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/767family/pf/pf_fltdeck.html |title=History of the 767 Two-Crew Flight Deck |publisher=Boeing |accessdate=July 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Becher|1999|p=32.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A three-crew cockpit remained as an option and was fitted to the first production models.&lt;ref name=becher33&gt;{{Harvnb|Becher|1999|p=33.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ansett Australia]] ordered 767s with three-crew cockpits due to union demands; it was the only airline to operate 767s so configured.&lt;ref name=becher33/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|2002|p= 117.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 767's two-crew cockpit was also applied to the 757, allowing pilots to operate both aircraft after a short conversion course,&lt;ref name=n160&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|p=160.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adding incentive for airlines to purchase both types.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

===Production and testing===
To produce the 767, Boeing formed a network of subcontractors which included domestic suppliers and international contributions from Italy's Aeritalia and Japan's CTDC.&lt;ref name=n156/&gt; The wings and cabin floor were produced in-house, while Aeritalia provided control surfaces, [[Boeing Rotorcraft Systems|Boeing Vertol]] made the [[leading edge]] for the wings, and [[Spirit AeroSystems|Boeing Wichita]] produced the forward fuselage.&lt;ref name=saver/&gt; The CTDC provided multiple assemblies through its constituent companies, namely [[Fuji Heavy Industries]] ([[Aircraft fairing|wing fairings]] and gear doors), [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]] (center fuselage), and [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] (rear fuselage, doors, and tail).&lt;ref name=n156/&gt; Components were integrated during final assembly at the Everett factory.&lt;ref name=saver/&gt; For expedited production of wing [[Spar (aviation)|spars]], the main structural member of aircraft wings, the Everett factory received [[robot]]ic machinery to automate the process of drilling holes and inserting [[fastener]]s.&lt;ref name=saver/&gt; This method of wing construction expanded on techniques developed for the 747.&lt;ref name=saver/&gt; Final assembly of the first aircraft began on July 6, 1979.&lt;ref name=Eden_p102/&gt;

The prototype aircraft, [[aircraft registration|registered]] N767BA and equipped with JT9D turbofans, rolled out on August 4, 1981.&lt;ref name=Shaw_twins&gt;{{harvnb|Shaw|1999|page = 64.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, the 767 program had accumulated 173 firm orders from 17 customers, including [[Air Canada]], [[All Nippon Airways]], [[Britannia Airways]], [[Transbrasil]], and [[Trans World Airlines]] (TWA).&lt;ref name=saver/&gt; On September 26, 1981, the prototype took its [[maiden flight]] under the command of company test pilots Tommy Edmonds, Lew Wallick, and John Brit.&lt;ref name=n161/&gt; The maiden flight was largely uneventful, save for the inability to retract the [[landing gear]] owing to a [[Hydraulics|hydraulic]] fluid leak.&lt;ref name=n161/&gt; The prototype was used for subsequent flight tests.&lt;ref name=b17/&gt;

The 10-month 767 flight test program utilized the first six aircraft built.&lt;ref name=Eden_p102/&gt;&lt;ref name=b17/&gt; The first four aircraft were equipped with JT9D engines, while the fifth and sixth were fitted with CF6 engines.&lt;ref name=Eden_p103/&gt;&lt;ref name=b50&gt;{{Harvnb|Birtles|1999|pp=49–52.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test fleet was largely used to evaluate avionics, flight systems, handling, and performance,&lt;ref name=b50/&gt; while the sixth aircraft was used for route-proving flights.&lt;ref name=testing/&gt; During testing, pilots described the 767 as generally easy to fly, with its maneuverability unencumbered by the bulkiness associated with larger wide-body jets.&lt;ref name=testing&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1982/1982%20-%200710.html |title= Boeing tests the twins |last=Sweetman |first=Bill |date=March 20, 1982 |work=Flight International |accessdate=July 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the successful completion of 1,600 hours of flight tests, the JT9D-powered 767-200 received certification from the US [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) and the UK [[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|Civil Aviation Authority]] (CAA) in July 1982.&lt;ref name=n161&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|pp=161–62.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b17&gt;{{harvnb|Birtles|1999|pp=16–18, 27.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first delivery occurred on August 19, 1982, to United Airlines.&lt;ref name=n161/&gt; The CF6-powered 767-200 received certification in September 1982, followed by the first delivery to Delta Air Lines on October 25, 1982.&lt;ref name=Eden_p103/&gt;

===Service entry and operations===

The 767 entered service with United Airlines on September 8, 1982.&lt;ref name=Haenggi_p31-5/&gt; The aircraft's first commercial flight used a JT9D-powered 767-200 on the Chicago-to-Denver route.&lt;ref name=Haenggi_p31-5&gt;{{harvnb|Haenggi|2003|pp=31–5.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CF6-powered 767-200 commenced service three months later with Delta Air Lines.&lt;ref name=Eden_p102/&gt; Upon delivery, early 767s were mainly deployed on domestic routes, including U.S. transcontinental services.&lt;ref name=b49/&gt; American Airlines and TWA began flying the 767-200 in late 1982, while [[Air Canada]], [[China Airlines]], and [[El Al]] began operating the aircraft in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Birtles|1999|pp=55–58.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft's introduction was relatively smooth, with few operational glitches and greater [[Dispatch (logistics)|dispatch]] [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] than prior jetliners.&lt;ref name=smooth&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1983/1983%20-%200561.html |title=Boeing 767 moves smoothly into service |last=Lynn |first=Norman |date=April 2, 1983 |work=Flight International |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its first year, the 767 logged a 96.1&amp;nbsp;percent rate of [[takeoff]] without delay due to technical issues, which exceeded the industry average for new aircraft.&lt;ref name=smooth/&gt; Operators reported generally favorable ratings for the twinjet's sound levels, interior comfort, and economic performance.&lt;ref name=smooth/&gt; Resolved issues were minor and included the recalibration of a leading edge sensor to prevent false readings, the replacement of an [[evacuation slide]] latch, and the repair of a [[tailplane]] pivot to match production specifications.&lt;ref name=smooth/&gt;

Seeking to capitalize on its new wide-body's potential for growth, Boeing offered an extended-range model, the 767-200ER, in its first year of service.&lt;ref name=no163&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1998|p=163.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ethiopian Airlines]] placed the first order for the type in December 1982.&lt;ref name=no163/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boe_767_back&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/767family/background.html |title=Boeing 767 Program Background |publisher=Boeing |accessdate=July 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Featuring increased [[gross weight]] specifications and greater fuel capacity, the extended-range model could carry heavier [[Payload (air and space craft)|payloads]] at distances up to {{convert|6385|nmi|km}},&lt;ref name=762specs/&gt; and was targeted at overseas customers.&lt;ref name=Eden_p103/&gt; The 767-200ER entered service with El Al on March 27, 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boe_767_back&quot;/&gt; The type was mainly ordered by international airlines operating medium-traffic, long-distance flights.&lt;ref name=Eden_p103/&gt;

In the mid-1980s, the 767 spearheaded the growth of twinjet flights across the northern Atlantic under extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards ([[ETOPS]]) regulations, the FAA's safety rules governing transoceanic flights by aircraft with two engines.&lt;ref name=no163/&gt;  Before the 767, over-water flight paths of twinjets could be no more than 90 minutes away from [[diversion airport]]s.&lt;ref name=haenggi_p38-40&gt;{{harvnb|Haenggi|2003|pp=38–40.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1985, the FAA granted its first approval for 120-minute ETOPS flights to 767 operators, on an individual airline basis starting with TWA, provided that the operator met flight safety criteria.&lt;ref name=haenggi_p38-40/&gt; This allowed the aircraft to fly overseas routes at up to two hours' distance from land.&lt;ref name=haenggi_p38-40/&gt; The larger safety margins were permitted because of the improved reliability demonstrated by the twinjet and its turbofan engines.&lt;ref name=haenggi_p38-40/&gt; The FAA lengthened the ETOPS time to 180 minutes for CF6-powered 767s in 1989, making the type the first to be certified under the longer duration,&lt;ref name=b49&gt;{{Harvnb|Birtles|1999|pp=49–53.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all available engines received approval by 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Becher|1999|pp= 150, 154–55.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulatory approval spurred the expansion of transoceanic 767 flights and boosted the aircraft's sales.&lt;ref name=no163/&gt;&lt;ref name=haenggi_p42&gt;{{harvnb|Haenggi|2003|p=42.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forecasting airline interest in larger-capacity models, Boeing announced the stretched 767-300 in 1983 and the extended-range 767-300ER in 1984.&lt;ref name=no163/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eden_p104/&gt; Both models offered a 20&amp;nbsp;percent passenger capacity increase,&lt;ref name=767_airport_report/&gt; while the extended-range version was capable of operating flights up to {{convert|5990|nmi|km}}.&lt;ref name=763specs/&gt; [[Japan Airlines]] placed the first order for the 767-300 in September 1983.&lt;ref name=no163/&gt; Following its first flight on January 30, 1986,&lt;ref name=Eden_p104&gt;{{harvnb|Eden|2008|pp=103–04.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the type entered service with Japan Airlines on October 20, 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boe_767_back&quot;/&gt; The 767-300ER completed its first flight on December 9, 1986,&lt;ref name=&quot;Boe_767_back&quot;/&gt; but it was not until March 1987 that the first firm order, from American Airlines, was placed.&lt;ref name=Eden_p104/&gt; The type entered service with American Airlines on March 3, 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boe_767_back&quot;/&gt; The 767-300 and 767-300ER gained popularity after entering service, and came to account for approximately two-thirds of all 767s sold.&lt;ref name=no163/&gt;

After the debut of the first stretched 767s, Boeing sought to address airline requests for even more capacity by proposing larger models, including a partial double-deck version informally named the &quot;Hunchback of Mukilteo&quot; (from a town near Boeing's Everett factory) with a 757 body section mounted over the aft main fuselage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090601173533/http://www.aiaa.org/sections/cl/what/mckinzie.htm |archivedate=June 1, 2009 |url=http://www.aiaa.org/sections/cl/what/mckinzie.htm |title=How United Airlines Helped Design The World's Most Remarkable Airliner |publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics |last=McKinzie|first=Gordon |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Norris_Wagner_777_p11-13&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2001|pages= 11–13, 15.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the manufacturer announced the 767-X, a revised model with extended wings and a wider cabin, but received little interest.&lt;ref name=Norris_Wagner_777_p11-13/&gt; By 1988, the 767-X had evolved into an all-new twinjet, which revived the [[Boeing 777|777]] designation.&lt;ref name=Norris_Wagner_777_p11-13/&gt; Until the 777's 1995 debut, the 767-300 and 767-300ER remained Boeing's second-largest wide-bodies behind the 747.&lt;ref name=Eden_p104/&gt;

Buoyed by a recovering global economy and ETOPS approval, 767 sales accelerated in the mid-to-late 1980s, with 1989 being the most prolific year with 132 firm orders.&lt;ref name=no163/&gt;&lt;ref name=haenggi_p42/&gt; By the early 1990s, the wide-body twinjet had become its manufacturer's annual best-selling aircraft, despite a slight decrease due to economic recession.&lt;ref name=no163/&gt; During this period, the 767 became the most common airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe.&lt;ref name=airl_777&gt;{{harvnb|Smil|1998|p= 28.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the decade, 767s crossed the Atlantic more frequently than all other aircraft types combined.&lt;ref name=davies89&gt;{{harvnb|Davies|2000|pp=88–89.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 767 also propelled the growth of [[Point-to-point transit|point-to-point]] flights which bypassed major [[airline hub]]s in favor of [[direct flight|direct routes]].&lt;ref name=Sutter_p241/&gt;&lt;ref name=p2p&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|2009|p=12.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking advantage of the aircraft's lower operating costs and smaller capacity, operators added non-stop flights to secondary population centers, thereby eliminating the need for connecting flights.&lt;ref name=Sutter_p241/&gt; The increase in the number of cities receiving non-stop services caused a paradigm shift in the airline industry as point-to-point travel gained prominence at the expense of the traditional [[Spoke-hub distribution paradigm|hub-and-spoke]] model.&lt;ref name=Sutter_p241/&gt;&lt;ref name=p2p/&gt;

In February 1990, the first 767 equipped with [[Rolls-Royce RB211]] turbofans, a 767-300, was delivered to [[British Airways]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Birtles|1999|pp=27–28.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six months later, the carrier temporarily grounded its entire 767 fleet after discovering cracks in the [[hardpoint|engine pylons]] of several aircraft.&lt;ref name=b64&gt;{{Harvnb|Birtles|1999|p=64.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cracks were related to the extra weight of the RB211 engines, which are {{convert|2205|lb|kg}} heavier than other 767 engines.&lt;ref name=b64/&gt; During the grounding, interim repairs were conducted to alleviate stress on engine pylon components, and a parts redesign in 1991 prevented further cracks.&lt;ref name=b64/&gt; Boeing also performed a structural reassessment, resulting in production changes and modifications to the engine pylons of all 767s in service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/boeing-acts-to-solve-757767-pylon-cracks-25909/ |title=Boeing acts to solve 757/767 pylon cracks |first=Guy |last=Norris |work=Flight International |date=May 24, 1995 |accessdate=December 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1993, following an order from [[UPS Airlines]],&lt;ref name=Eden_p105&gt;{{harvnb|Eden|2008|p=105.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boeing launched a freighter variant, the 767-300F, which entered service with UPS on October 16, 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boe_767_back&quot;/&gt; The 767-300F featured a main deck cargo hold, upgraded landing gear, and strengthened wing structure.&lt;ref name=f63/&gt; In November 1993, the Japanese government launched the first 767 military derivative when it placed orders for the {{nowrap|E-767}}, an [[Airborne Early Warning and Control]] (AWACS) variant based on the 767-200ER.&lt;ref name=b39/&gt; The first two {{nowrap|E-767s}}, featuring extensive modifications to accommodate surveillance [[radar]] and other monitoring equipment, were delivered in 1998 to the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]].&lt;ref name=aw33/&gt;&lt;ref name=poise/&gt;

===Overview===
[[File:Boeing 767 Nose Section 41.jpg|thumb|left|The nose assembly of a Boeing 767, also known as fuselage section 41|alt=Close up view of a green Section 41, the nose section of a 767. Installation is not yet complete for the window panes.]]

The 767 is a low-wing [[Cantilever#Aircraft|cantilever monoplane]] with a conventional tail unit featuring a single fin and rudder. The wings are swept at 31.5 degrees and optimized for a cruising speed of [[Mach number|Mach]] 0.8 ({{convert|533|mph|km/h|sigfig=3|abbr=on|disp=or}}).&lt;ref name=no22/&gt; Each wing features a supercritical cross-section and is equipped with six-panel [[leading edge slat]]s, single- and double-slotted [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]], inboard and outboard [[aileron]]s, and six [[Spoiler (aeronautics)|spoilers]].&lt;ref name=saver/&gt;&lt;ref name=b15&gt;{{Harvnb|Birtles|1999|pp=15–16.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[airframe]] further incorporates [[carbon-fiber reinforced plastic]] composite wing surfaces, [[Kevlar]] [[Aircraft fairing|fairings]] and access panels, plus improved [[aluminium alloy|aluminum alloys]], which together reduce overall weight by {{convert|1900|lb|kg}} versus preceding aircraft.&lt;ref name=saver/&gt;

To distribute the aircraft's weight on the ground, the 767 has a retractable [[Tricycle gear|tricycle landing gear]] with four wheels on each main gear and two for the nose gear.&lt;ref name=saver/&gt; The original wing and gear design accommodated the stretched 767-300 without major changes.&lt;ref name=no163/&gt; The 767-400ER features a larger, more widely spaced main gear with 777 wheels, tires, and brakes.&lt;ref name=no119&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1999|pp=119, 121.}}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent damage if the tail section contacts the runway surface during takeoff, 767-300 and 767-400ER models are fitted with a retractable [[tailstrike|tailskid]].&lt;ref name=no119/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.boeing.com/news/frontiers/archive/2004/december/i_tt.html |title=Striking out tailstrikes|first=Katherine |last=Sopranos|work=Frontiers|date=December 2004|accessdate=August 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 767 has exit doors near the front and rear of the aircraft on the left side.&lt;ref name=767_airport_report/&gt;

In addition to shared avionics and computer technology, the 767 uses the same [[auxiliary power unit]], electric power systems, and hydraulic parts as the 757.&lt;ref name=intro&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1982/1982%20-%200014.html |title=Boeing 757: introducing the big-fan narrowbody |date=January 2, 1983 |last=Velupillai |first=David |work=Flight International |accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A raised cockpit floor and the same forward cockpit windows result in similar pilot viewing angles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Norris|Wagner|1996|p=69.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related design and functionality allows 767 pilots to obtain a common [[type rating]] to operate the 757 and share the same [[Seniority list|seniority roster]] with pilots of either aircraft.&lt;ref name=no23/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wells|Clarence|2004|p=252.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flight systems===

The 767 is equipped with three redundant hydraulic systems for operation of control surfaces, landing gear, and other equipment.&lt;ref name=b24/&gt; Each engine powers a separate hydraulic system, and the third system uses electric pumps.&lt;ref name=b24&gt;{{harvnb|Birtles|1999|p=24.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[ram air turbine]] is fitted to provide power for basic controls in the event of an emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Birtles|1999|p=50.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An early form of [[fly-by-wire]] is employed for spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables.&lt;ref name=saver/&gt; The fly-by-wire system reduces weight and provides for the independent operation of individual spoilers.&lt;ref name=saver/&gt;

===Interior===
The 767 features a twin-aisle cabin with a typical configuration of six abreast in [[business class]] and seven across in [[economy class|economy]].&lt;ref name=767_airport_report/&gt; The standard seven abreast, 2–3–2 economy class layout places approximately 87&amp;nbsp;percent of all seats at a window or aisle.&lt;ref name=kane553&gt;{{harvnb|Kane|2003|pp=553.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the aircraft can be largely occupied before center seats need to be filled,&lt;ref name=saver/&gt; and each passenger is no more than one seat from the aisle.&lt;ref name=kane553/&gt; It is possible to configure the aircraft with extra seats for up to an eight abreast configuration,&lt;ref name=767_airport_report/&gt; but this results in a cramped cabin and is therefore uncommon.&lt;ref name=Haenggi_p34&gt;{{harvnb|Haenggi|2003|p=34.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early 767 incident was survived by all on board. On July 23, 1983, [[Gimli Glider|Air Canada Flight 143]], a 767-200, ran out of fuel in-flight and had to glide with both engines out for almost {{convert|43|nmi|km}} to an emergency landing at [[Gimli, Manitoba]]. The pilots used the aircraft's ram air turbine to power the hydraulic systems for aerodynamic control. There were no fatalities and only minor injuries. This aircraft was nicknamed &quot;Gimli Glider&quot; for the airport at which it landed. The aircraft, registered C-GAUN, continued flying for Air Canada until its retirement in January 2008.&lt;ref name=gimli&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/storied-gimli-glider-on-final-approach/article666567/|title=Storied 'Gimli Glider' on final approach |work=Globe and Mail |date=January 24, 2008 |accessdate=August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, the U.S. [[Federal Aviation Administration]] issued a directive that ordered inspections of the elevators on more than 400 767s beginning in March 2014; the focus is on [[fastener]]s and other parts that can fail and cause the elevators to jam.  The issue was first identified in 2000 and has been the subject of several Boeing service bulletins. The inspections and repairs are required to be completed within six years.&lt;ref&gt;Pasztor, Andy.
