Business statistics
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Refimprove|date=September 2009}}
'''Business statistics''' is the science of good decision making in the face of uncertainty and is used in many disciplines such as [[financial analysis]], [[econometrics]], [[auditing]], production and operations including services improvement, and marketing research.&lt;ref&gt;• 
''[[Journal of Business &amp; Economic Statistics]]'', [http://pubs.amstat.org/page/jbes/aims-and-scope Aims and Scope.]&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;• [http://www.amstat.org/publications/jbes.cfm &quot;''Journal of Business &amp; Economic Statistics'', American Statistical Association.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

These sources feature regular repetitive publication of series of data. This makes the topic of [[time series]] especially important for business statistics. It is also a branch of [[applied statistics]] working mostly on data collected as a by-product of doing business or by government agencies. It provides knowledge and skills to interpret and use statistical techniques in a variety of business applications. 

A typical business statistics course is intended for [[Business_education#Undergraduate_education|business majors]], and covers statistical study, descriptive statistics (collection, description, analysis, and summary of data), probability, and the binomial and [[normal distribution]]s, test of hypotheses and confidence intervals, [[linear regression]], and correlation.&lt;ref&gt;• E.
