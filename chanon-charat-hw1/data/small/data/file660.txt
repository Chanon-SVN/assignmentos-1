The '''Australian Labor Party''' (also '''ALP''' and '''Labor''', was '''Labour''' before 1912) is a [[List of political parties in Australia|political party in Australia]]. The party has been in opposition at federal level since the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 election]]. [[Bill Shorten]] has been the party's federal parliamentary leader since 13 October 2013. The party is a federal party with branches in each [[Australian states and territories|state and territory]]. Labor is in government in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. The party competes against the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]/[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] for political office at the [[Government of Australia|federal]] and [[Parliaments of the Australian states and territories|state]] (and sometimes [[Local government in Australia|local]]) levels.

Labor's constitution states: &quot;The Australian Labor Party is a democratic socialist party and has the objective of the democratic socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange, to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features in these fields&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net&quot;&gt;[http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/australianlaborparty/pages/121/attachments/original/1365135867/Labor_National_Platform.pdf?1365135867 Australian Labor Party National Platform]. Retrieved 11 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This &quot;socialist objective&quot; was introduced in 1921, but has since been qualified by two further objectives: &quot;maintenance of and support for a competitive non-monopolistic private sector&quot; and &quot;the right to own private property&quot;. Labor governments have not attempted the &quot;democratic socialisation&quot; of any industry since the 1940s, when the Chifley government failed to nationalise the private banks, and in fact have [[privatisation|privatised]] several industries such as aviation and banking. Labor's current National Platform describes the party as &quot;a modern social democratic party&quot;, &quot;the party of opportunity and security for working people&quot; and &quot;a party of active government&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net&quot;/&gt;

The ALP was founded as a [[Federalism in Australia|federal party]] prior to the first sitting of the [[Parliament of Australia|Australian Parliament]] in 1901, but is descended from labour parties founded in the various Australian colonies by the emerging [[Australian labour movement|labour movement in Australia]], formally beginning in 1892. Labor is thus the country's oldest political party. Colonial labour parties contested seats from 1891, and federal seats following the [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1901|1901 federal election]]. Labor was the first party in Australia to win a majority in either house of the Australian Parliament, at the [[Australian federal election, 1910|1910 federal election]]. The ALP pre-dates both the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] and the [[New Zealand Labour Party]] in party formation, government, and policy implementation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://australianpolitics.com/political-parties/alp|title=Australian Labor Party|date=6 October 2013|accessdate=11 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, the ALP is a member of the [[Progressive Alliance (political international)|Progressive Alliance]] network of social-democratic parties,&lt;ref&gt;http://progressive-alliance.info/participants/&lt;/ref&gt; having previously been a member of the [[Socialist International]].

&lt;!-- do not add a second image of a current Labor prime minister here, this is for previous Labor prime ministers --&gt;
The present Australian Labor Party has its origins in the Labour parties founded in the 1890s in the Australian colonies prior to federation. Labor tradition ascribes the founding of Queensland Labour to a meeting of striking pastoral workers under a ghost gum tree (the &quot;[[Tree of Knowledge (Australia)|Tree of Knowledge]]&quot;) in [[Barcaldine, Queensland]] in 1891. The [[Balmain, New South Wales]] branch of the party claims to be the oldest in Australia. Labour as a parliamentary party dates from 1891 in New South Wales, [[South Australian state election, 1893|1893 in South Australia]] and Queensland, and later in the other colonies.

The first election contested by Labour candidates was the [[1891 New South Wales election]], when Labour candidates (then called the Labor Electoral League of New South Wales) won 35 of 141 seats. The major parties were the [[Protectionist Party|Protectionist]] and [[Free Trade Party|Free Trade]] parties and Labour held the [[Balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]]. It offered parliamentary support in exchange for policy concessions.&lt;ref&gt;''So Monstrous a Travesty'', Ross McMullen. Scribe Publications 2004. p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Labour Party was founded in South Australia in 1891 (survived until 1917), and three candidates were that year elected to the [[South Australian Legislative Council]].&lt;ref name=PHA&gt;[http://www.sahistorians.org.au/175/chronology/may/9-may-1891-united-labor-party-elected-to-legislati.shtml Professional Historians Association (South Australia)]&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[South Australian state election, 1893|1893 South Australian elections]] the United Labour Party won 10 of the 54 seats in the House of Assembly, and went into coalition with the Liberal Party. In 1905 [[Thomas Price]] became the first Labor [[Premier of South Australia]].&lt;ref name=PHA /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1899, [[Anderson Dawson]] formed a minority Labour&lt;!-- do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context --&gt; government in [[Queensland]], the first in the world, which lasted one week while the [[Conservatism|conservatives]] regrouped after a split.

The colonial Labour&lt;!-- do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context --&gt; parties and the trade unions were mixed in their support for the [[Federation of Australia]]. Some Labour representatives argued against the proposed constitution, claiming  that the Senate as proposed was too powerful, similar to the anti-reformist colonial upper houses and the [[House of Lords|British House of Lords]]. They feared that federation would further entrench the power of the conservative forces. The first Labour&lt;!-- do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context --&gt; leader and Prime Minister, [[Chris Watson]], however, was a supporter of federation.

===Early decades at federal level===
The first election to the [[Australian federal election, 1901|federal Parliament in 1901]] was contested by each state Labour party. In total, they won 14 of the 75 seats in the House of Representatives, and the Labour members now met as the federal parliamentary Labour&lt;!-- do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context --&gt; Party (informally known as the [[caucus]]) on 8 May 1901 at [[Parliament House, Melbourne]], the meeting place of the first federal Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Faulkner; Macintyre (2001) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The caucus decided to support the Protectionist government against the opposition Free Trade Party. It was some years before there was any significant structure or organisation at a national level. Labour &lt;!-- do not change spelling, is correct in historical context --&gt;under [[Chris Watson]] more than doubled its vote to 23 at the [[Australian federal election, 1903|1903 federal election]] and continued to hold the balance of power. In April 1904, however, Watson and Deakin fell out over the issue of extending the scope of industrial relations laws concerning the [[Conciliation]] and [[Arbitration]] Bill to cover state public servants, the fallout causing Deakin to resign. Free Trade leader [[George Reid (Australian politician)|George Reid]] declined to take office, which saw Watson become the first Labour&lt;!-- do not change spelling, is correct in historical context --&gt; [[Prime Minister of Australia]], and the world's first Labour head of government at a national level ([[Anderson Dawson]] had led a short-lived Labour government in Queensland in December 1899), though his was a [[minority government]] that lasted only four months. He was aged only 37, and is still the youngest Prime Minister in Australia's history.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{Australian Dictionary of Biography |last= Nairn |first= Bede |year= 1990 |id= A120450b |title= Watson, John Christian (1867–1941)  | accessdate =9 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Fisher]] then formed another minority government 1908–09. At the [[Australian federal election, 1910|1910 election]], Fisher led Labor to victory. The Fisher government was Australia's first federal [[majority government]], held Australia's first [[Australian Senate|Senate]] majority, and was the world's first labour party majority government. This was the first time a labour party had controlled any house of a legislature, and the first time it controlled both houses of a bicameral legislature.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{cite web

The state branches formed their first majority governments in [[New South Wales]] and South Australia in 1910, in Western Australia in 1911, in [[Queensland]] in 1915 and in [[Tasmania]] in 1925. Such success eluded equivalent social democratic and labour parties in other countries for many years.

Analysis of the early NSW Labor caucus reveals &quot;a band of unhappy amateurs&quot;, made up of blue collar workers, a squatter, a doctor, and even a mine owner, indicating that the idea that only the socialist working class formed Labor is untrue. In addition, many members from the working class supported the liberal notion of

In the aftermath of [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], support for socialism grew in trade union ranks, and at the 1921 All-Australian Trades Union Congress a resolution was passed calling for &quot;the socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange.&quot; As a result, Labor's Federal Conference in 1922 adopted a similarly worded &quot;socialist objective,&quot; which remained official policy for many years. The resolution was immediately qualified, however, by the &quot;[[Maurice Blackburn|Blackburn]] amendment,&quot; which said that &quot;socialisation&quot; was desirable only when was necessary to &quot;eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McKinlay (1981) p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; In practice the socialist objective was a dead letter. Only once has a federal Labor government attempted to nationalise any industry ([[Ben Chifley]]'s bank nationalisation of 1947), and that was held by the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] to be unconstitutional. The commitment to nationalisation was dropped by [[Gough Whitlam]], and [[Bob Hawke]]'s government carried out many free market reforms including the floating of the dollar and [[privatisation]] of state enterprises such as [[Qantas]] airways and the [[Commonwealth Bank of Australia|Commonwealth Bank]].

The Labor Party is commonly described as a [[social democracy|social democratic]] party, and its constitution stipulates that it is a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.alp.org.au/platform/chapter_12.php|title= National Constitution of the ALP|year= 2009|work= Official Website of the Australian Labor Party|publisher= Australian Labor Party|accessdate=26 December 2009|quote= The Australian Labor Party is a democratic socialist party and has the objective of the democratic socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange, to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features in these fields.}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was created by, and has always been influenced by, the trade unions, and in practice its policy at any given time has usually been the policy of the broader labour movement. Thus at the first federal election 1901 Labor's platform called for a [[White Australia Policy]], a citizen army and compulsory arbitration of industrial disputes.&lt;ref&gt;McKinlay (1981) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Labor has at various times supported high [[tariff]]s and low tariffs, [[conscription]] and [[pacifism]], White Australia and [[multiculturalism]], [[nationalisation]] and [[privatisation]], [[isolationism]] and internationalism.

Historically, Labor and its affiliated unions were strong defenders of the [[White Australia Policy]], which banned all non-European migration to Australia. This policy was partly motivated by 19th century theories about &quot;[[Racial hygiene|racial purity]]&quot; and by fears of economic competition from low-wage overseas workers which was shared by the vast majority of Australians and all major political parties. In practice the party opposed all migration, on the grounds that immigrants competed with Australian workers and drove down wages, until after [[World War II]], when the [[Chifley Government]] launched a major immigration program. The party's opposition to non-European immigration did not change until after the retirement of [[Arthur Calwell]] as leader in 1967. Subsequently Labor has become an advocate of [[multiculturalism]], although some of its trade union base and some of its members continue to oppose high immigration levels.

====Name changes====
The ALP adopted the formal name &quot;Australian Labour Party&quot;&lt;!-- do not change spelling, it is correct in historical context --&gt; in 1908, but changed the spelling to &quot;Labor&quot; in 1912. While it is standard practice in [[Australian English]] both today and at the time to spell the word &quot;labour&quot; with a &quot;u&quot;, the party was influenced by the [[Labor history of the United States|United States labor movement]], and a prominent figure in the early history of the party, the American-born [[King O'Malley]], was successful in having the spelling &quot;modernised&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alp.org.au/about/history.php |publisher=Australian Labor Party |title=History of the Australian Labor Party}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change also made it easier to distinguish references to the party from the [[labour movement]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, FG, ''Australia: A Concise Political and Social History'' (Sydney: Harcourt Brace &amp; Company 1996), p 205&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the spelling &quot;labor&quot; had been acceptable in both British and Australian English in earlier periods. (''See also [[Australian spelling|Spelling in Australian English]]''.)

===World War II and beyond===
The [[Curtin Government|Curtin]] and [[Chifley Government|Chifley]] governments governed Australia through the latter half of [[World War II]] and initial stages of transition to peace. Labor leader [[John Curtin]] became prime minister in October 1941 when two independents crossed the floor of Parliament. Labor, led by Curtin, then led Australia through the years of the [[Pacific War]]. In December 1941, Curtin announced that &quot;Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom&quot;, thus helping to establish the Australian-American alliance (later formalised as [[ANZUS]] by the [[Menzies Government]]). Remembered as a strong war time leader and for a landslide win at the [[Australian federal election, 1943|1943 election]], Curtin died in office just prior to the end of the war and was succeeded by [[Ben Chifley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/curtin/ |title=John Curtin – Australia's PMs – Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |date= |accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chifley Labor won the [[Australian federal election, 1946|1946 election]] and oversaw Australia's initial transition to a peacetime economy. Labor was defeated at the [[Australian federal election, 1949|1949 election]]. At the conference of the New South Wales Labor Party in June 1949, Chifley sought to define the labour movement as having:

{{quotation|[A] great objective&amp;nbsp;– the light on the hill&amp;nbsp;– which we aim to reach by working for the betterment of mankind... [Labor would] bring something better to the people, better standards of living, greater happiness to the mass of the people.|Ben Chifley|source=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/chifley/in-office.aspx |title=In office&amp;nbsp;– Ben Chifley&amp;nbsp;– Australia's PMs&amp;nbsp;– Australia's Prime Ministers |accessdate=13 July 2011 |date=24 February 2009 |publisher=National Archives of Australia | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110613100927/http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/chifley/in-office.aspx| archivedate= 13 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

To a large extent, Chifley saw centralisation of the economy as the means to achieve such ambitions. With an increasingly uncertain economic outlook, after his attempt to nationalise the banks and a strike by the Communist-dominated Miners Federation, Chifley lost office at in 1949 to [[Robert Menzies]]' Liberal-National Coalition. Labor commenced what would be a 23-year period in opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/chifley/ |title=Ben Chifley – Australia's PMs – Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |date=13 June 1951 |accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/menzies/elections.aspx |title=Elections – Robert Menzies – Australia's PMs – Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |date= |accessdate=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various ideological beliefs were factionalised under reforms to the ALP under [[Gough Whitlam]], resulting in what is now known as the [[Socialist Left (Australia)|Socialist Left]] who tend to favour a more interventionist economic policy and more [[social progressivism|socially progressive]] ideals, and [[Labor Right]], the now dominant faction that tends to be more [[economic liberalism|economically liberal]] and focus to a lesser extent on social issues. The Whitlam Labor government, marking a break with Labor's socialist tradition, pursued [[social democracy|social-democratic]] policies rather than [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] policies. Whitlam, in contrast to earlier Labor leaders, also cut [[tariff]]s by 25 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitlam.org/collection/1973/19730718_Tariff_Reduction/ |title=Tariff Reduction |publisher=The Whitlam Institute |work=The Whitlam Collection}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitlam led the Federal Labor Party back to office at the [[Australian federal election, 1972|1972]] and [[Australian federal election, 1974|1974 elections]], and passed a large amount of legislation. The [[Whitlam Government]] lost office following the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]] and dismissal by [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] Sir [[John Kerr (governor-general)|John Kerr]] after the Coalition blocked [[Loss of supply|supply]] in the Senate after a series of political scandals, and was defeated at the [[Australian federal election, 1975|1975 election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/general/the-dismissal-a-brief-history/2005/11/10/1131578175136.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=The dismissal: a brief history | date=11 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitlam remains the only Prime Minister to have his commission terminated in that manner.

[[Bob Hawke]] led Labor back to office at the [[Australian federal election, 1983|1983 election]] and the [[Hawke-Keating Government]] remained in power until defeated by [[John Howard]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1996|1996 election]].

[[Kim Beazley]] led the party to the [[Australian federal election, 1998|1998 election]], winning 51 percent of the [[two-party preferred vote]] but falling short on seats, and lost ground at the [[Australian federal election, 2001|2001 election]]. [[Mark Latham]] led Labor to the [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004 election]] but lost further ground. Beazley replaced Latham in 2005. Beazley in turn was challenged by [[Kevin Rudd]] who went on to defeat John Howard at the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 election]] with 52.7 percent of the two-party vote. The [[First Rudd Government|Rudd Government]] ended prior to the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 election]] with the replacement of Rudd as leader of the Party by deputy leader [[Julia Gillard]]. The [[Gillard Government]] was commissioned to govern in a [[hung parliament]] following the 2010 election with a one-seat parliamentary majority and 50.12 percent of the two-party vote.

Between the 2007 federal election and the [[Western Australian state election, 2008|2008 Western Australian state election]], Labor was in government nationally, as well as in all eight state and territory legislatures. This was the first time any single party or any coalition had achieved this since the ACT and the NT gained self-government.&lt;ref&gt;In 1969–1970, before the ACT and NT achieved self-government, the Liberal and National Coalition was in power federally and in all six states. [http://elections.uwa.edu.au/ University of WA elections database]&lt;/ref&gt; After narrowly losing government in Western Australia at the 2008 state election and Victoria at the [[Victorian state election, 2010|2010 state election]], Labor lost government in landslides in New South Wales at the [[2011 New South Wales State Election|2011 state election]] and Queensland at the [[Queensland state election, 2012|2012 state election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/national/barry-ofarrell-smashes-labor-in-nsw-election/story-e6frfkvr-1226028779988 | work=The Sunday Telegraph | first=Barclay | last=Crawford | title=Barry O'Farrell smashes Labor in NSW election | date=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National platform==
The policy of the Australian Labor Party is contained in its National Platform, which is approved by delegates to Labor's National Conference, held every three years. According to the Labor Party's website, &quot;The Platform is the result of a rigorous and constructive process of consultation, spanning the nation and including the cooperation and input of state and territory policy committees, local branches, unions, state and territory governments, and individual Party members. The Platform provides the policy foundation from which we can continue to work towards the election of a federal Labor Government.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alp.org.au/platform/index.php |publisher=Australian Labor Party |title=ALP National Platform and Constitution 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The platform gives a general indication of the policy direction which a future Labor government would follow, but does not commit the party to specific policies. It maintains that &quot;Labor's traditional values will remain a constant on which all Australians can rely.&quot; While making it clear that Labor is fully committed to a market economy, it says that: &quot;Labor believes in a strong role for national government&amp;nbsp;– the one institution all Australians truly own and control through our right to vote.&quot; Labor &quot;will not allow the benefits of change to be concentrated in fewer and fewer hands, or located only in privileged communities. The benefits must be shared by all Australians and all our regions.&quot; The Platform and Labor &quot;believe that all people are created equal in their entitlement to dignity and respect, and should have an equal chance to achieve their potential.&quot; For Labor, &quot;government has a critical role in ensuring fairness by: ensuring equal opportunity; removing unjustifiable discrimination; and achieving a more equitable distribution of wealth, income and status.&quot; Further sections of the Platform stress Labor's support for equality and human rights, labour rights and democracy.

In practice, the Platform provides only general policy guidelines to Labor's federal, state and territory parliamentary leaderships. The policy Labor takes into an election campaign is determined by the Cabinet (if the party is in office) or the Shadow Cabinet (if it is in opposition), in consultation with key interest groups within the party, and is contained in the parliamentary Leader's policy speech delivered during the election campaign. When Labor is in office, the policies it implements are determined by the Cabinet, subject to the Platform. Generally, it is accepted that while the Platform binds Labor governments, how and when it is implemented remains the prerogative of the parliamentary caucus. It is now rare for the Platform to conflict with government policy, as the content of the Platform is usually developed in close collaboration with the party's parliamentary leadership as well as the factions. However, where there is a direct contradiction with the Platform, Labor governments have sought to change the Platform as a prerequisite for a change in policy. For example, privatisation legislation under the Hawke government occurred only after holding a special national conference to debate changing the Platform.

==Party structure==
The Australian Labor Party is a democratic and federal party, which consists of both individual members and [[affiliated trade union]]s, who between them decide the party's policies, elect its governing bodies and choose its candidates for public office. Besides its federal organisation, the party also has branches in each state and territory, each of which in turn consists of local branches, which any Australian resident can join, plus affiliated trade unions.

Individual members pay a membership fee, which is graduated according to income. The party has about 35,000 individual members,&lt;ref name=&quot;review&quot;&gt;[http://www.alp.org.au/australian-labor/review2010/ ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this figure tends to fluctuate along with the party's electoral fortunes. The majority of [[Australian labour movement|trade unions in Australia]] are affiliated to the party. Union affiliation is direct and not through the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]]. Affiliated unions pay an affiliation fee based on the size of their membership. Union affiliation fees make up a large part of the party's income. Another source of funds for the party are [[Political donations in Australia|political donations]] and [[Elections in Australia#Public funding|public funding]].

Members are generally expected to attend at least one meeting of their local branch each year, although there are differences in the rules from state to state. In practice only a dedicated minority regularly attend meetings. Many members are only active during election campaigns.

The members and unions elect delegates to state and territory conferences (usually held annually, although more frequent conferences are often held). These conferences decide policy, and elect state or territory executives, a state or territory president (an honorary position usually held for a one-year term), and a state or territory secretary (a full-time professional position). The larger branches also have full-time assistant secretaries and organisers. In the past the ratio of conference delegates coming from the branches and affiliated unions has varied from state to state, however under recent national reforms at least 50% of delegates at all state and territory conferences must be elected by branches.

The party holds a national conference every three years, which consists of delegates representing the state and territory branches (many coming from affiliated trade unions, although there is no formal requirement for unions to be represented at the national conference). The national conference approves the party's platform and policies, elects the [[Australian Labor Party National Executive|national executive]], and appoints office-bearers such as the National Secretary, who also serves as national campaign director during elections. The current National Secretary is [[George Wright (trade unionist)|George Wright]]. The most recent National Conference was held from 2 to 4 December 2011.

The federal parliamentary leader of the Labor Party was elected by the Labor members of the national Parliament (the [[Caucus]]) from the party's establishment until 2013. Since October 2013, a ballot of both the Parliamentary [[Caucus]] and by the Labor Party's rank-and-file members determined the party's parliamentary leaders, inclusive of the leader and the deputy leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/bill-shorten-elected-labor-leader-20131013-2vfzy.html|title=Bill Shorten elected Labor leader|author=Harrison, Bill|date=13 October 2013|accessdate=19 July 2014|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2003, the national conference elected the party's national president, but since then the position has rotated amongst a presidential team of three, directly elected by the party's individual members. Each member of the team serves a one-year term as national president, with the other members serving as vice-presidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.theage.com.au/breaking-news-national/bligh-joins-alp-national-president-team-20090330-9gcd.html Bligh joins ALP national president team], ''The Age'', 30 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The current national president is [[Jenny McAllister]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alp.org.au/australian-labor/member-news/welcome-to-new-alp-national-president/ Welcome to New ALP National President], Australian Labor Party, 6 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; the national vice-presidents are [[Tony Sheldon (trade unionist)|Tony Sheldon]] and [[Jane Garrett]].

The Labor Party contests national, state and territory elections. In some states it also contests local government elections or endorses local candidates: in others it does not, preferring to allow its members to run as non-endorsed candidates. The process of choosing candidates is called [[preselection]]. Candidates are preselected by different methods in the various states and territories. In some they are chosen by ballots of all party members, in others by panels or committees elected by the state conference, in still others by a combination of these two.

Labor candidates are required to sign a pledge that if elected they will always vote in the relevant Parliament in accordance with the platform and decisions made by a vote of the relevant Caucus. They are also sometimes required to donate a portion of their salary to the party, although this practice has declined with the introduction of public funding for political parties.

==Factions==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
The Labor Party has always had a left wing and a right wing, but since the 1970s it has been organised into formal factions, to which party members may belong and often pay an additional membership fee. The two largest factions are [[Labor Unity]] (on the right) and the [[Socialist Left (Australia)|Socialist Left]]. Labor Unity generally supports free-market policies and the US alliance and tends to be conservative on some social issues. The national Left, although it seldom openly espouses socialism, favours more state intervention in the economy, is generally less enthusiastic about the US alliance and is often more progressive on social issues. The factions are themselves divided into sub-factions, primarily state-based.

Labor-affiliated trade unions are also factionally aligned. The largest unions supporting the right are the [[Australian Workers' Union]] (AWU), the [[National Union of Workers]] (NUW), the [[Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees' Association]] (SDA), and the [[Transport Workers Union of Australia|Transport Workers Union]] (TWU). Important unions supporting the left include the [[Australian Manufacturing Workers Union]] (AMWU), [[United Voice]], the [[Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union]] (CFMEU), the [[Australian Services Union]] (ASU) and the [[Maritime Union of Australia]] (MUA). These affiliations are seldom unconditional or permanent. The AWU and the NUW, for example, are bitter rivals and the NUW sometimes aligns itself with the left. Moreover, in some cases different union branches may have different factional alignments. On some issues, such as opposition to the [[Howard Government]]'s industrial relations policy, most unions are in agreement.

[[Preselection]]s are usually conducted along factional lines, although sometimes a non-factional candidate will be given preferential treatment (this happened with [[Cheryl Kernot]] in 1998 and again with [[Peter Garrett]] in 2004). Deals between the factions to divide up the safe seats between them often take place. Preselections, particularly for safe Labor seats, can sometimes be strongly contested. A particularly fierce preselection sometimes gives rise to accusations of [[branch stacking]] (signing up large numbers of nominal party members to vote in preselection ballots), [[personation]], multiple voting and, on occasions, fraudulent electoral enrolment. Trade unions were in the past accused of giving inflated membership figures to increase their influence over preselections, but party rules changes have stamped out this practice. Preselection results are sometimes challenged, and the [[Australian Labor Party National Executive|National Executive]] is sometimes called on to arbitrate these disputes.

===Labor Networks===
The Australian Labor Party, is beginning to formally recognise single interest groups within the party. Examples of such groups include the [[Labor Environment Action Network]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lean.net.au/&lt;/ref&gt; Rainbow Labor,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rainbowlabor.org/pages/&lt;/ref&gt; Labor for Refugees&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/labor4refugees&lt;/ref&gt; and Labor Renewal.&lt;ref&gt;http://laborrenewal.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The Tasmanian Branch of the Australian Labor Party recently gave these groups, known as Policy Action Caucuses, voting and speaking rights at their state conference.
