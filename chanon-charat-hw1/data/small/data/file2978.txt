The '''Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress''' is a four-engine [[heavy bomber]] aircraft developed in the 1930s for the [[United States Army Air Corps]] (USAAC). Competing against [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]] and [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Martin]] for a contract to build 200 bombers, the [[Boeing]] entry outperformed both competitors and exceeded the Air Corps' expectations. Although Boeing lost the contract because the prototype crashed, the Air Corps was so impressed with Boeing's design that they ordered 13 more B-17s for further evaluation. From its introduction in 1938, the B-17 Flying Fortress evolved through numerous [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress variants|design advances]].&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Dana T. ''Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II,'' pp. 35, 40–48, Cypress, CA, 2013. ISBN 978-0-9897906-0-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Arthur.

The B-17 was primarily employed by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) in the daylight precision [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing campaign of World War&amp;nbsp;II]] against German industrial and military targets. The United States [[Eighth Air Force]], based at many airfields in southern England, and the [[Fifteenth Air Force]], based in Italy, complemented the [[RAF Bomber Command]]'s nighttime area bombing in the [[Combined Bomber Offensive]] to help secure air superiority over the cities, factories and battlefields of Western Europe in preparation for [[Operation Overlord|the invasion of France]] in 1944.&lt;ref name= &quot;Carey Pointblank&quot; /&gt; The B-17 also participated to a lesser extent in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|War in the Pacific]], early in World War II, where it conducted raids against Japanese shipping and airfields.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Dana T. ''Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II,'' p. 41, Cypress, CA, 2013. ISBN 978-0-9897906-0-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

From its pre-war inception, the USAAC (later USAAF) touted the aircraft as a strategic weapon; it was a potent, high-flying, long-range bomber that was able to defend itself, and to return home despite extensive battle damage&lt;!--might need some links--&gt;. Its reputation quickly took on mythic proportions,&lt;ref name=&quot;Manual&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;browne&quot;/&gt; and widely circulated stories and photos of notable numbers and examples of B-17s surviving battle damage increased its iconic status.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnsen 2006&quot; /&gt; With a [[Ceiling (aeronautics)#Service ceiling|service ceiling]] greater than any of its Allied contemporaries, the B-17 established itself as an effective weapons system, dropping more bombs than any other U.S. aircraft in World War&amp;nbsp;II. Of the {{Nowrap|1.5 million [[metric ton]]s}} of bombs dropped on [[Germany]] and its occupied territories by U.S. aircraft, 640,000&amp;nbsp;tons were dropped from B-17s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yenne.p46&quot; /&gt;

As of September 2011, [[List of surviving Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses|13 aircraft]] remain airworthy, with dozens more in storage or on static display.

On 8 August 1934, the [[United States Army Air Corps|U.S. Army Air Corps]] (USAAC) tendered a proposal for a multi-engined bomber to replace the [[Martin B-10]]. The Air Corps was looking for a bomber capable of reinforcing the air forces in Hawaii, Panama, and Alaska.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tate.p164&quot; /&gt; Requirements were that it would carry a &quot;useful bombload&quot; at an altitude of {{convert|10000|ft|km|0}} for 10 hours with a top speed of at least {{convert|200|mph|km/h|-1}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swan Mil p74&quot; /&gt;

They also desired, but did not require, a range of {{convert|2000|mi|km|-2}} and a speed of {{convert |250|mph|km/h}}. The competition for the Air Corps contract would be decided by a &quot;fly-off&quot; between Boeing's design, the [[Douglas B-18 Bolo|Douglas DB-1]], and the [[Martin Model 146]] at [[Wright Field]] in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], [[Ohio]].

The prototype B-17, designated Model 299, was designed by a team of engineers led by E. Gifford Emery and [[Edward Curtis Wells]], and was built at Boeing's own expense.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p41&quot;/&gt; It combined features of the experimental [[Boeing XB-15]] bomber with the [[Boeing 247]] transport aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swan Mil p74&quot;/&gt; The B-17's armament consisted of up to {{convert|4800|lb|kg}} of bombs on two racks in the bomb bay behind the cockpit, and initially possessed five {{convert|0.30|in|mm|2}} [[machine gun]]s.  It was powered by four [[Pratt &amp; Whitney R-1690]] &quot;Hornet&quot; radial engines each producing {{convert|750|hp|kW|-2}} at {{convert|7000|ft|m|-2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p291-2&quot;/&gt;

The first flight of the Model 299 was on {{Nowrap|28 July}} 1935 with Boeing chief test-pilot Leslie Tower at the controls.&lt;ref name=&quot;first flight&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sal.p46&quot;/&gt; Richard Williams, a reporter for the ''[[The Seattle Times|Seattle Times]]'', coined the name &quot;Flying Fortress&quot; when the Model 299 was rolled out bristling with multiple machine gun installations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yenne.p12&quot;/&gt; The most unusual gun emplacement was the nose installation (see note for description and drawing), which allowed the single machine gun to be fired toward almost any frontal angle that an approaching enemy fighter would take to attack the B-17.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=WSgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1933+plane+%22Popular+Science%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=kH7gTamNN4P40gH1u52xBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBjg8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true &quot;Army's Biggest Bomber Has Rotating Nose.&quot;] ''Popular Science Monthly,'' August 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boeing was quick to see the value of the name and had it trademarked for use.  Boeing also claimed in some of the early press releases that Model 299 was the first combat aircraft that could continue its mission if one of its four engines failed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=wN8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA519&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1935+plane+%22Popular+Mechanics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=aJgvTv3XKdSgsQLVyIRv&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true &quot;Giant Bomber Flies Four Miles Per Minute.&quot;] ''Popular Mechanics'', October 1935.&lt;/ref&gt; On {{Nowrap|20 August 1935}}, the prototype flew from [[Seattle]] to Wright Field in nine hours and three minutes at an average cruising speed of {{convert|252|mph|km/h}}, much faster than the competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes.299Record&quot; /&gt;

At the fly-off, the four-engine Boeing's performance was superior to those of the twin-engine DB-1 and Model 146. Then-[[Major General]] [[Frank Maxwell Andrews]] of the [[United States Army Air Corps#GHQ Air Force|GHQ Air Force]] believed that the long-range capabilities of four-engine large aircraft were more effective than shorter-ranged, twin-engined aircraft, and that the B-17 was better suited to their doctrine.&lt;ref name = &quot;Zamzow.33&quot; /&gt; His opinions were shared by the Air Corps procurement officers, and even before the competition had finished they suggested buying 65 B-17s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tate 165&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zamzow.34&quot; /&gt;

Development continued on the Boeing Model 299, and on {{Nowrap|30 October}} 1935, Army Air Corps test-pilot Major [[Ployer Peter Hill]] and Boeing employee Les Tower took the Model 299 on a second evaluation flight. The crew forgot to disengage the &quot;[[gust lock]]s,&quot; a system of devices integral to the design that held the bomber's movable control surfaces in place while the aircraft was parked on the ground. After take-off, due to the failure to manually disengage all of the gust locks, the aircraft entered a steep climb, stalled, nosed over, and crashed, killing Hill and Tower (other observers survived with injuries).&lt;ref name=&quot;Museum&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Checks&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref group=N&gt;On board the aircraft were pilots [[Major]] Ployer P. Hill (his first time flying the 299) and Lieutenant Donald Putt (the primary Army pilot for the previous evaluation flights), Leslie Tower, Boeing mechanic C.W. Benton, and Pratt and Whitney representative Henry Igo. Putt, Benton and Igo escaped with burns, and Hill and Tower were pulled from the wreckage alive, but later died from their injuries.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crashed Model 299 could not finish the evaluation and, while the Air Corps was still enthusiastic about the aircraft's potential, Army officials were daunted by the much greater expense per aircraft&lt;ref name= &quot;Sal.p48&quot; /&gt; (Douglas quoted a unit price of $58,200 based on a production order of 220 aircraft, compared with a price of $99,620 from Boeing&lt;ref name=&quot;Francillon Doug p201-2&quot;/&gt;), and as the competition could not be completed Boeing was legally disqualified from the consideration for the contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zamzow.34&quot;/&gt; Army Chief of Staff [[Malin Craig]] cancelled the order for 65 YB-17s, and ordered 133 of the twin-engine [[Douglas B-18 Bolo]] instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tate 165&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zamzow.34&quot; /&gt;
{{quote|The loss was not total... but Boeing's hopes for a substantial bomber contract were dashed.|Peter Bowers, 1976&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers1976.p37&quot;&gt;Bowers 1976, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Initial orders ===
Regardless, the USAAC had been impressed by the prototype's performance, and on {{Nowrap|17 January}} 1936, through a legal loophole,&lt;ref name=&quot;Meilinger&quot;/&gt; the Air Corps ordered 13 YB-17s (designated Y1B-17 after November 1936 to denote its special F-1 funding) for service testing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zamzow.34&quot;/&gt; The YB-17 incorporated a number of significant changes from the Model 299, including more powerful [[Wright R-1820]]-39 Cyclone engines replacing the original Pratt &amp; Whitneys. Although the prototype was company-owned and never received a military serial (the B-17 designation itself did not appear officially until January 1936, nearly three months after the prototype crashed),&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers1976.p12&quot;/&gt; the term &quot;XB-17&quot; was retroactively applied to the airframe and has entered the lexicon to describe the first Flying Fortress.

Between 1 March and 4 August 1937, 12 of the 13 Y1B-17s were delivered to the 2nd Bombardment Group at [[Langley Field]] in Virginia for operational development and flight tests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swan Mil p75&quot;/&gt; One suggestion adopted was the use of a [[pre-flight checklist]] to avoid accidents such as that which befell the Model 299.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meilinger&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Checks2&quot;/&gt;{{#tag:ref|The idea of a pilot's checklist spread to other crew members, other Air Corps aircraft types, and eventually throughout the aviation world. ''Life'' magazine published the lengthy B-17 checklist in its 24 August 1942 issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=fk4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;f=true &quot;B-17 checklist.&quot;] ''Life'', 24 August 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=N}} In one of their first missions, three B-17s, directed by lead navigator [[Lieutenant]] [[Curtis LeMay]], were sent by General Andrews to [[Interception of the Rex|&quot;intercept&quot; and photograph the Italian ocean liner ''Rex'']] {{convert|610|mi|km}} off the Atlantic coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zamzow.47&quot;/&gt; The mission was successful and widely publicized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maurer&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USAF Rex&quot;/&gt; The 13th Y1B-17 was delivered to the Material Division at Wright Field, Ohio, to be used for flight testing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Y1B-17&quot;/&gt;

[[File:B-17B Bombers at March Field, California prior to 7 December 1941.jpg|thumb|B-17Bs at [[March Field]], California, prior to attack on [[Naval Station Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]], with framed nose glazing of the style retained through the B-17E model.]]
A 14th Y1B-17 (''37-369''), originally constructed for ground testing of the airframe's strength, was upgraded and fitted with exhaust-driven turbochargers. Scheduled to fly in 1937, it encountered problems with the turbochargers, and its first flight was delayed until {{Nowrap|29 April}} 1938.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald&quot;/&gt; The aircraft was delivered to the Army on {{Nowrap|31 January}} 1939.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p293-4&quot;/&gt; Once service testing was complete, the Y1B-17s and Y1B-17A were redesignated B-17 and B-17A respectively to signify the change to operational status.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wixley p23&quot;/&gt;

Opposition to the Air Corps' ambitions for the acquisition of more B-17s faded, and in late 1937, 10 more aircraft designated B-17B were ordered to equip two bombardment groups, one on each U.S. coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;B-17B&quot;/&gt; Improved with larger flaps, rudder and a well-framed [[Acrylic glass|Plexiglas]] nose, the B-17Bs were delivered in five small batches between July 1939 and March 1940. In July 1940, a significant order for 512 B-17s was issued;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pop1&quot;/&gt; however, prior to the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], fewer than 200 B-17s were in service with the Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meilinger&quot;/&gt;

A total of 155 B-17s of all variants were delivered between {{Nowrap|11 January}} 1937 and {{Nowrap|30 November}} 1941, but production quickly accelerated with the B-17 eventually setting the record for achieving the highest production rate for large aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Serling.p55&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref group=N&gt;Quote: &quot;At the peak of production, Boeing was rolling out as many as 363 B-17s a month, averaging between 14 and 16 Forts a day, the most incredible production rate for large aircraft in aviation history.&quot; This production rate was however surpassed by that of the [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator]].&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft went on to serve in every [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] combat zone, and by the time production ended in May 1945, 12,731 aircraft had been built by Boeing, [[Douglas Aircraft Company|Douglas]], and [[Vega Aircraft Corporation|Vega]] (a subsidiary of [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Yenne.p6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herman, Arthur.

The aircraft went through several alterations in each of its design stages and variants. Of the 13 YB-17s ordered for service testing, 12 were used by the 2nd Bomb Group of Langley Field, Virginia, to develop heavy bombing techniques, and the 13th was used for flight testing at the Material Division at Wright Field, Ohio.&lt;ref name=&quot;Y1B-17&quot;/&gt; Experiments on this aircraft led to the use of a quartet of turbo-superchargers which would become standard on the B-17 line. A 14th aircraft, the YB-17A, originally destined for ground testing only and upgraded with the turbochargers,&lt;ref name=&quot;flightinter&quot;/&gt; was re-designated B-17A after testing had finished.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p293-4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wixley p23&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Boeing XB-17 blister turret.jpg|thumb|left|Waist position gun blister of Model 299, not adopted for production]]

As the production line developed, Boeing engineers continued to improve upon the basic design. To enhance performance at slower speeds, the B-17B was altered to include larger [[rudder]] and [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers boeing p294&quot;/&gt; The B-17C changed from three bulged, oval shaped machine gun blisters to two flush, oval-shaped machine gun window openings and a single &quot;bathtub&quot; machine gun housing on the lower fuselage,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p295&quot;/&gt; that resembled the similarly configured and located ventral defensive emplacement on the German [[Heinkel He 111]]P-series medium bomber. Models ''A'' through ''D'' of the B-17 were designed defensively, while the large-tailed B-17E was the first model primarily focused on offensive warfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;flightinter&quot;/&gt;

The B-17E was an extensive revision of the Model 299 design: The fuselage was extended by {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}}; a much larger rear fuselage, vertical tail fin, rudder, and horizontal stabilizer were added to the design; a gunner's position was added in the new tail; the nose (especially the bombardier's well-framed nose glazing) remained relatively the same as the earlier -B through -D versions had, but with the addition of a [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]] electrically powered manned dorsal [[gun turret]] just behind the cockpit, and the similarly powered (also built by Sperry) manned ventral [[ball turret]] just aft of the bomb bay – replacing a relatively hard-to-use, Bendix-designed remotely operated ventral turret on the earliest examples of the -E variant, that had also been used on the earlier marks of the North American B-25 Mitchell – resulted in a 20% increase in aircraft weight.&lt;ref name=&quot;flightinter&quot;/&gt; The B-17's [[turbocharged]] [[Wright R-1820]] ''Cyclone 9'' engines were upgraded to increasingly more powerful versions of the same powerplants multiple times throughout its production, and similarly, the number of machine gun emplacement locations were increased to enhance their aircraft's combat effectiveness.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p56-7&quot;/&gt;

The B-17F variants were the primary versions flying for the Eighth Air Force to face the Germans in 1943, and had standardized the manned Sperry ball turret for ventral defense, along with an enlarged, nearly frameless Plexiglas bombardier's nose enclosure for much improved forward vision.

[[File:Boeing B-17F 42-29513 in flight, 1943.jpg|thumb|right|A B-17F of the 99th Bomb Group, with the nearly frameless clear-view bombardier's nose.]]

Two experimental versions of the B-17 were flown under different designations, the [[XB-38 Flying Fortress]] and the [[YB-40 Flying Fortress]]. The XB-38 was an engine testbed for [[Allison V-1710]] liquid-cooled engines, should the Wright engines normally used on the B-17 become unavailable. The only prototype XB-38 to fly crashed on its ninth flight and the type was abandoned, the V-1710 being kept for fighters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Francillon Lock p213-5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p66&quot;/&gt;

The YB-40 was a heavily armed modification of the standard B-17 used before the [[North American P-51 Mustang]], an effective long-range fighter, became available to act as escort. Additional armament included an additional dorsal turret in the radio room, a remotely operated and fired Bendix-built &quot;chin turret&quot; and twin {{convert|.50|in|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} guns in each of the waist positions. The ammunition load was over 11,000 rounds, making the YB-40 well over {{convert|10000|lb|abbr=on}} heavier than a fully loaded B-17F. The YB-40s with their numerous heavy modifications had trouble keeping up with the lighter bombers once they had dropped their bombs, and so the project was abandoned and finally phased out in July 1943,&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF 62-3,5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Francillon Lock p212&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p307-8&quot;/&gt; but not before the final production blocks of the B-17F from Douglas' plants adopted the YB-40's remotely operated and fired Bendix &quot;chin turret&quot; for a much-improved forward defensive weapons installation.

By the time the definitive B-17G appeared, the number of guns had been increased from seven to thirteen, the designs of the gun stations were finalized, and other adjustments were completed. The B-17G was the final version of the Flying Fortress, incorporating all changes made to its predecessor, the B-17F,&lt;ref name=&quot;flightinter&quot;/&gt; adopting the remotely operated &quot;chin turret&quot; for forward defense from the YB-40 &quot;gunship&quot; version, and in total 8,680 were built,&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p63-4&quot;/&gt; the last one (by Lockheed) on {{Nowrap|28 July}} 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Francillon Lock p211&quot;/&gt; Many B-17Gs were converted for other missions such as cargo hauling, engine testing and [[Reconnaissance aircraft|reconnaissance]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p286-7&quot;/&gt; Initially designated SB-17G, a number of B-17Gs were also converted for search-and-rescue duties, later to be redesignated B-17H.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p303-4&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Boeing SB-17G.jpg|thumb|Postwar SB-17G-95DL &lt;br /&gt;AF Ser. No. ''44-83722'' assigned to the 2nd ERS as a Search and Rescue aircraft]]

Late in World War&amp;nbsp;II, at least 25 B-17s were fitted with radio controls and television cameras, loaded with {{convert|20000|lb|abbr=on}} of high-explosives and dubbed BQ-7 &quot;Aphrodite missiles&quot; for [[Operation Aphrodite]]. The operation, which involved remotely flying Aphrodite drones onto their targets by accompanying CQ-17 &quot;mothership&quot; control aircraft, was approved on {{nowrap|26 June}} 1944, and assigned to the [[388th Bombardment Group]] stationed at [[RAF Fersfield]], a satellite of [[RAF Knettishall]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramsey&quot;/&gt;

The first four drones were sent to [[Fortress of Mimoyecques|Mimoyecques]], the [[Siracourt V-1 bunker]], [[Blockhaus d'Éperlecques|Watten]] and [[La Coupole|Wizernes]] on 4 August, causing little damage. The project came to a sudden end with the unexplained mid-air explosion over the [[River Blyth, Suffolk|Blyth]] estuary of a [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24]], part of the [[United States Navy]]'s contribution as &quot;Project Anvil&quot;, en route for [[Heligoland]] piloted by Lieutenant [[Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.]], future U.S. president [[John F. Kennedy]]'s elder brother. Blast damage was caused over a radius of {{convert|5|mi}}. British authorities were anxious that no similar accidents should again occur, and the Aphrodite project was scrapped in early 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramsey&quot;&gt;Ramsey, Winston G. &quot;The V-Weapons&quot;.

==Operational history==
[[File:Living Legends.jpg|thumb|B-17 Flying Fortresses from the [[398th Air Expeditionary Group|398th Bombardment Group]] fly a bombing run to [[Neumünster]], Germany, on 13 April 1945. On 8 May, Germany surrendered, and [[Victory in Europe Day]] was declared.]]
The B-17 began operations in [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]] with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) in 1941 (but was not successful), and in the Southwest Pacific with the U.S. Army. The 19th Bombardment Group had deployed to Clark Field in the Philippines a few weeks before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor as the first of a planned heavy bomber buildup in the Pacific. Half of the group's B-17s were wiped out on 8 December 1941 when they were caught on the ground during refueling and rearming for a planned attack on Japanese airfields on Formosa. The small force of B-17s operated against the Japanese invasion force until they were withdrawn to Darwin, in Australia's Northern Territory. In early 1942, the 7th Bombardment Group began arriving in Java with a mixed force of B-17s and LB-30/B-24s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edmonds&quot;&gt;Edmonds, Walter. ''They Fought With  They Had''. 1951, pp. 1–314.&lt;/ref&gt; After the defeat in Java, the 19th withdrew to Australia where it continued in combat until it was sent back home by Gen. George C. Kenney when he arrived in Australia in mid-1942.&lt;ref&gt;Kenney, George C. ''General Kenney Reports.'' New York: Duell, Sloan and Pierce, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1942, the first USAAF B-17s were sent to England to join [[Eighth Air Force]]. Later that year two groups moved to Algeria to join Twelfth Air Force for operations in North Africa. The B-17s were primarily involved in the daylight precision [[strategic bombing]] campaign against German targets ranging from U-boat pens, docks, warehouses and airfields to industrial targets such as aircraft factories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cravens, Wesley 1956&quot;&gt;Cravens, Wesley ''Army Air Forces in WW II.'' Washington, D.C.: Office of Air Force History, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Operation Pointblank|the campaign against German aircraft forces]] in preparation for the invasion of France, B-17 and B-24 raids were directed against German aircraft production while their presence drew the ''Luftwaffe'' fighters into battle with Allied fighters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carey Pointblank&quot;/&gt;

Early models proved to be unsuitable for combat use over Europe and it was the  B-17E that was first successfully used by the USAAF. The defense expected from bombers operating in close formation alone did not prove effective and the bombers needed fighter escorts to operate successfully.

During World War II, the B-17 equipped 32 overseas combat groups, inventory peaking in August 1944 at 4,574 USAAF aircraft worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baugher Squads&quot;/&gt; B-17s dropped {{convert|640036|short ton|metric ton|lk=in}} of bombs on European targets (compared to {{convert|452508|short ton|metric ton|abbr=on}} dropped by the Liberator and {{convert|463544|short ton|metric ton|abbr=on}} dropped by all other U.S. aircraft).{{Clarify|is this a summary of data further on in this section? should it have a reference here?|date=June 2010}} The British heavy bombers, the [[Avro Lancaster]] and [[Handley Page Halifax]], dropped 608,612 long tons (681,645 short tons) and 224,207 long tons (251,112 short tons) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raf.mod.uk/rafbramptonwytonhenlow/aboutus/handleypagehalifax.cfm &quot;Handley Page Halifax.&quot;] ''The Pathfinder Museum'' via ''raf.mod.uk.'' Retrieved: 1 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.

===The RAF===
[[File:B-17C with RAF colors.jpg|thumb|RAF Fortress B.I ''[[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|AN529]]'', with [[Heinkel He 111|He 111H]]-style &quot;bathtub&quot; ventral [[Gondola (airplane)|gondola]].]]
The [[Royal Air Force]] entered World War II with no heavy bomber of its own in service; the biggest available were long-range medium bombers such as the [[Vickers Wellington]] which could carry up to {{convert|4500|lb|kg}} of bombs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Andrews &amp; Morgan p340&quot;/&gt; While the [[Short Stirling]] and [[Handley Page Halifax]] would become its primary bombers by 1941, in early 1940 the RAF entered into an agreement with the U.S. Army Air Corps to be provided with 20 B-17Cs, which were given the [[British military aircraft designation systems|service name]] Fortress I. Their first operation, against [[Wilhelmshaven]] on {{Nowrap|8 July}} 1941 was unsuccessful;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yenne.p23&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chant&quot;/&gt; on {{Nowrap|24 July}}, the target was [[Brest, France]], but again the bombers missed completely.

By September, after the RAF had lost eight B-17Cs in combat or to accidents and many instances of aborts due to mechanical problems, [[RAF Bomber Command|Bomber Command]] abandoned daylight bombing raids because of the Fortress I's poor performance. The experience showed both the RAF and USAAF that the B-17C was not ready for combat, and that improved defenses, larger bomb loads and more accurate bombing methods were required. However the USAAF continued using the B-17 as a day bomber, despite misgivings by the RAF that attempts at daylight bombing would be ineffective.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigley.338&quot;/&gt;

As usage by Bomber Command had been curtailed, the RAF transferred its remaining Fortress&amp;nbsp;I aircraft to [[RAF Coastal Command|Coastal Command]] for use as a long-range maritime patrol aircraft instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stitt 1&quot;/&gt; These were later augmented in August 1942 by 19 Fortress Mk II (B-17F) and 45 Fortress Mk IIA (B-17E). A Fortress from [[No. 206 Squadron RAF]] sank [[U-627]] on {{Nowrap|27 October}} 1942, the first of 11 U-boat kills credited to RAF Fortress bombers during the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wynn.93&quot;/&gt;

The RAF's [[No. 223 Squadron RAF|No. 223 Squadron]], as part of [[No. 100 Group RAF|100 Group]], operated a number of Fortresses equipped with an electronic warfare system known as &quot;Airborne Cigar&quot; (ABC). This was operated by German–speaking radio operators who would identify and jam German ground controllers' broadcasts to their [[nightfighter]]s. They could also pose as ground controllers themselves with the intention of steering nightfighters away from the [[bomber stream]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/news/2007/12/13/db1301.xml &quot;Obituaries: John Hereford.&quot;] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 13 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial USAAF operations over Europe===
The Air Corps (renamed [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) on 20 June 1941), using the B-17 and other bombers, bombed from high altitudes using the then-secret [[Norden bombsight]], known as the &quot;Blue Ox&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/aviation/sec.htm CR.NPS.gov: ''Second-Generation Norden Bombsight Vault'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Blue Ox.&quot; ''National Geographic Magazine'', Vol. LXXXIII, Number One, January 1943,  p. 7, Ad(i).&lt;/ref&gt; which was an optical electro-mechanical gyro-stabilized [[analog computer]].&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Paul. ''Ludington Daily News'', 16 April 1994, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The device was able to determine, from variables input by the bombardier, the point at which the aircraft's bombs should be released to hit the target. The bombardier essentially took over flight control of the aircraft during the bomb run, maintaining a level altitude during the final moments before release.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baugher B-17B&quot;/&gt;

The USAAF began building up its air forces in Europe using B-17Es soon after entering the war. The first [[Eighth Air Force]] units arrived in [[High Wycombe, England]], on {{Nowrap|12 May}} 1942, to form the 97th Bomb Group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Northstar&quot;/&gt; On {{Nowrap|17 August}} 1942, 12 B-17Es of the 97th, with the lead aircraft piloted by Major [[Paul Tibbets]] and carrying [[Brigadier General]] [[Ira Eaker]] as an observer, were escorted by four squadrons of RAF [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] (and a further five squadrons to cover the withdrawal) on the first USAAF heavy bomber raid over Europe, against railroad [[Classification yard|marshalling yards]] at [[Rouen]]-Sotteville in France, while a further six aircraft flew a diversionary raid along the French coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p59-0&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AAF combat&quot;/&gt; The operation was a success, with only minor damage to two aircraft and half the bombs landing in the target area. The raid helped assuage British doubts about the capabilities of American heavy bombers in operations over Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''The Army Air Forces in WWII'' p662-663&lt;/ref&gt;

As the raids of the American bombing campaign grew in numbers and frequency, German interception efforts grew in strength (such as during the attempted bombing of Kiel on 13 June 1943&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman.7&quot;/&gt;), such that unescorted bombing missions came to be discouraged.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigley 339&quot;/&gt;

===Combined offensive===
The two different strategies of the American and British bomber commands were organized at the [[Casablanca Conference (1943)|Casablanca Conference]] in January 1943. The resulting &quot;[[Combined Bomber Offensive]]&quot; would weaken the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'', destroy German morale and establish air superiority through [[Operation Pointblank]]'s destruction of German fighter strength in preparation of a ground offensive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carey Pointblank&quot;/&gt; The USAAF bombers would attack by day, with British operations – chiefly against industrial cities – by night.

[[File:B-17F formation over Schweinfurt, Germany, August 17, 1943.jpg|left|thumb|B-17F formation over [[Schweinfurt]], Germany, {{Nowrap|17 August}} 1943]]
[[File:B-17F Radar Bombing over Germany 1943.jpg|left|thumb|Boeing B-17F [[radar]] bombing through clouds: [[Bremen]], Germany, on {{Nowrap|13 November}} 1943.]]

Operation Pointblank opened with attacks on targets in Western Europe. General [[Ira C. Eaker]] and the Eighth Air Force placed highest priority on attacks on the German aircraft industry, especially fighter assembly plants, engine factories and ball-bearing manufacturers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carey Pointblank&quot;/&gt; Attacks began in April 1943 on heavily fortified key industrial plants in [[Bremen]] and [[Recklinghausen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman.8&quot;/&gt;

Since the airfield bombings were not appreciably reducing German fighter strength, additional B-17 groups were formed, and Eaker ordered major missions deeper into Germany against important industrial targets. The 8th Air Force then targeted the ball-bearing factories in [[Schweinfurt]], hoping to cripple the war effort there. The [[Schweinfurt-Regensburg mission|first raid]] on {{Nowrap|17 August}} 1943 did not result in critical damage to the factories, with the 230 attacking B-17s being intercepted by an estimated 300 ''Luftwaffe'' fighters. The Germans shot down 36 aircraft with the loss of 200 men, and coupled with a raid earlier in the day against [[Regensburg]], a total of 60 B-17s were lost that day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hess.pp59-60&quot;/&gt;

A second attempt on Schweinfurt on 14 October 1943 would later come to be known as &quot;[[Second Raid on Schweinfurt|Black Thursday]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Hess.pp65-67/&gt; While the attack was successful at disrupting the entire works, severely curtailing work there for the remainder of the war, it was at an extreme cost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowman.22&quot;/&gt; Of the 291 attacking Fortresses, 60 were shot down over Germany, five crashed on approach to Britain, and 12 more were scrapped due to damage&amp;nbsp;– a total loss of 77 B-17s.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFM.76-9&quot;/&gt; A total of 122 bombers were damaged and needed repairs before their next flight. Out of 2,900 men in the crews, about 650 men did not return, although some survived as [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]]. Only 33 bombers landed without damage. These losses were a result of concentrated attacks by over 300 German fighters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hess.p64&quot;/&gt;

[[File:B-17G formation on bomb run.jpg|thumb|B-17G of the 384th Bomb Group on the bomb run]]

Such high losses of air crews could not be sustained, and the USAAF, recognizing the vulnerability of heavy bombers to interceptors when operating alone, suspended daylight bomber raids deep into Germany until the development of an escort fighter that could protect the bombers all the way from the United Kingdom to Germany and back. At the same time, the German night fighting ability noticeably improved to counter the nighttime strikes, challenging the conventional faith in the cover of darkness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigley.341&quot;/&gt; The [[Eighth Air Force]] alone lost 176 bombers in October 1943,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hess.p67&quot;/&gt; and was to suffer similar casualties on {{Nowrap|11 January}} 1944 on missions to [[Oschersleben]], [[Halberstadt]] and [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]]. [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lieutenant General]] [[Jimmy Doolittle|James Doolittle]], commander of the Eighth, had ordered the second Schweinfurt mission to be cancelled as the weather deteriorated, but the lead units had already entered hostile air space and continued with the mission. Most of the escorts turned back or missed the rendezvous, and as a result 60 B-17s were destroyed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hess.69-71&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;C&amp;W.151&quot;/&gt; A third raid on Schweinfurt on {{Nowrap|24 February}} 1944 highlighted what came to be known as &quot;[[Big Week]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigley.340-1&quot;/&gt; during which the bombing missions were directed against German aircraft production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigley.341&quot;/&gt; German fighters would have to respond, and the [[North American P-51 Mustang]] and [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt]] fighters (equipped with improved [[drop tank]]s to extend their range) accompanying the American heavies all the way to and from the targets would engage them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weigley.342&quot;/&gt; The escort fighters reduced the loss rate to below seven percent, with only 247 B-17s lost in 3,500 [[sortie]]s while taking part in the Big Week raids.&lt;ref name=&quot;C&amp;W.162&quot;/&gt;

By September 1944, 27 of the 42 bomb groups of the Eighth Air Force and six of the 21 groups of the [[15th Expeditionary Mobility Task Force|Fifteenth Air Force]] used B-17s. Losses to [[flak]] continued to take a high toll of heavy bombers through 1944, but by {{Nowrap|27 April}} 1945 (two days after the last heavy bombing mission in Europe), the rate of aircraft loss was so low that replacement aircraft were no longer arriving and the number of bombers per bomb group was reduced. The Combined Bomber Offensive was effectively complete.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAAF.04-45&quot;/&gt;

===Pacific Theater===
[[File:NARA 28-1277a.jpg|thumb| B-17C AAF S/N ''40-2074'' at [[Hickam Field]]. An onboard fire burnt the aircraft in two shortly after landing on {{Nowrap|7 December}} 1941. One crewman was killed by Zero attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;A&amp;K.1&quot;/&gt;]]

On 7 December 1941, a group of 12 B-17s of the 38th (four B-17C) and 88th (eight B-17E) Reconnaissance Squadrons, en route to reinforce the Philippines, were flown into Pearl Harbor from [[Hamilton Field, California|Hamilton Field]], [[California]], arriving during the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Leonard &quot;Smitty&quot; Smith Humiston, co-pilot on [[First Lieutenant]] Robert H. Richards' B-17C, AAF S/N ''40-2049'', reported that he thought the U.S. Navy was giving the flight a 21-gun salute to celebrate the arrival of the bombers, after which he realized that Pearl Harbor was under attack. The Fortress came under fire from Japanese fighter aircraft, though the crew was unharmed with the exception of one member who suffered an abrasion on his hand. Enemy activity forced an abort from [[Hickam Field]] to [[Bellows Field]], where the aircraft overran the runway and into a ditch where it was then strafed. Although initially deemed repairable, ''40-2049'' (11th BG / 38th RS) received more than 200 bullet holes and never flew again. Ten of the 12 Fortresses survived the attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;A&amp;K.2&quot;/&gt;

By 1941, the [[Far East Air Force (United States)|Far East Air Force]] (FEAF) based at [[Clark Air Base|Clark Field]] in the Philippines had 35 B-17s, with the War Department eventually planning to raise that to 165.&lt;ref name=&quot;bloody p55-6&quot;/&gt; When the FEAF received word of the attack on Pearl Harbor, [[General]] [[Lewis H. Brereton]] sent his bombers and fighters on various patrol missions to prevent them from being caught on the ground. Brereton planned B-17 raids on Japanese air fields in [[Taiwan|Formosa]], in accordance with [[Rainbow 5]] war plan directives, but this was overruled by General [[Douglas MacArthur]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloody p163&quot;/&gt; A series of [[Battle of the Philippines (1941–42)#Far East Air Force controversy|disputed discussions and decisions]], followed by several confusing and false reports of air attacks, delayed the authorization of the sortie. By the time the B-17s and escorting [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]] fighters were about to get airborne, they were destroyed by Japanese bombers of the [[11th Air Fleet (Japan)|11th Air Fleet]]. The FEAF lost half its aircraft during the first strike,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloody p166-7&quot;/&gt; and was all but destroyed over the next few days.

Another early World War II Pacific engagement on {{Nowrap|10 December}} 1941 involved [[Colin Kelly]] who reportedly crashed his B-17 into the [[Japanese battleship Haruna|Japanese battleship ''Haruna'']], which was later acknowledged as a near bomb miss on the [[Japanese cruiser Ashigara|heavy cruiser ''Ashigara'']]. Nonetheless, this deed made him a celebrated [[war hero]]. Kelly's B-17C AAF S/N ''40-2045'' (19th BG / 30th BS) crashed about {{convert|6|mi|km|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} from Clark Field after he held the burning Fortress steady long enough for the surviving crew to bail out. Kelly was posthumously awarded the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sal.p64&quot;/&gt;
Noted Japanese ace [[Saburo Sakai]] is credited with this kill, and in the process, came to respect the ability of the Fortress to absorb punishment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sakai&quot;/&gt;

B-17s were used in early battles of the Pacific with little success, notably the [[Battle of Coral Sea]]&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p96&quot;/&gt; and [[Battle of Midway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sword p180,329&quot;/&gt; While there, the [[Fifth Air Force]] B-17s were tasked with disrupting the Japanese sea lanes. Air Corps doctrine dictated bombing runs from high altitude, but it was soon discovered that only one percent of their bombs hit targets. However, B-17s were operating at heights too great for most [[A6M Zero]] fighters to reach, and the B-17's heavy gun armament was more than a match for lightly protected Japanese aircraft.

On 2 March 1943, six B-17s of the 64th Squadron attacked a major Japanese troop convoy from {{convert|10000|ft|km|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} during the early stages of the [[Battle of the Bismarck Sea]], off [[New Guinea]], using [[skip bombing]] to sink three merchant ships including the {{ship|SS|Kyokusei Maru||2}}. A B-17 was shot down by a [[New Britain]]-based [[A6M Zero]], whose pilot then machine-gunned some of the B-17 crew members as they descended in parachutes and attacked others in the water after they landed.&lt;ref name=&quot;awm&quot;/&gt; Later, 13 B-17s bombed the convoy from medium altitude, causing the ships to disperse and prolonging the journey. The convoy was subsequently all but destroyed by a combination of low level strafing runs by [[Royal Australian Air Force]] [[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighters]], and skip bombing by USAAF [[North American B-25 Mitchell]]s at {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}}, while B-17s claimed five hits from higher altitudes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frisbee&quot;/&gt;

A peak of 168 B-17 bombers were in the Pacific theater in September 1942, with all groups converting to other types by mid-1943. In mid-1942, Gen. Arnold decided that the B-17 was inadequate for the kind of operations required in the Pacific and made plans to replace all of the B-17s in the theater with B-24s as soon as they became available. Although the conversion was not complete until mid-1943, B-17 combat operations in the Pacific theater came to an end after a little over a year.&lt;ref&gt;Kenney, George C. ''General Kenney Reports.'' New York: Duall, Sloan and Pearce, 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving aircraft were reassigned to the 54th Troop Carrier Wing's special airdrop section, and were used to drop supplies to ground forces operating in close contact with the enemy. Special airdrop B-17s supported Australian commandos operating near the Japanese stronghold at Rabaul, which had been the primary B-17 target in 1942 and early 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson 1945 {{page needed|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bomber defense===
[[File:Bomber stream.jpg|thumb|Part of a USAAF stream of over 1,000 B-17s]]
Before the advent of long-range [[Fighter aircraft|fighter]] escorts, B-17s had only their [[.50 BMG|.50 caliber]] [[M2 Browning machine gun]]s to rely on for defense during the bombing runs over Europe. As the war intensified, Boeing used feedback from aircrews to improve each new variant with increased armament and armor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boeing&quot;/&gt; The number of defensive guns increased from four {{convert|0.50|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} machine guns and one {{convert|0.30|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} nose machine gun in the B-17C, to thirteen {{convert|0.50|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} machine guns in the B-17G. But because the bombers could not [[air combat manoeuvring|maneuver]] when attacked by fighters, and needed to be flown straight and level during their final bomb run, individual aircraft struggled to fend off a direct attack.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-657-6304-24, Luftwaffe, Modelle eines Bombers und Jägers.jpg|thumb|left|German training model on how to attack a &quot;flying porcupine&quot; (''fliegendes Stachelschwein'')]]

A 1943 survey by the Air Corps found that over half the bombers shot down by the Germans had left the protection of the main formation.&lt;ref name=&quot;B-17.de 2&quot;/&gt; To address this problem, the United States developed the bomb-group formation, which evolved into the staggered [[combat box]] formation where all the B-17s could safely cover any others in their formation with their machine guns, making a formation of the bombers a dangerous target to engage by enemy fighters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manual 2&quot;/&gt; ''Luftwaffe'' fighter pilots likened attacking a B-17 combat box formation to encountering a ''fliegendes Stachelschwein'', &quot;flying porcupine&quot;, with dozens of machine guns on a combat box formation of bombers, aimed at them from almost every direction. However, the use of this rigid formation meant that individual aircraft could not engage in evasive maneuvers: they had to fly constantly in a straight line, which made them vulnerable to the German [[flak]]. Moreover, German fighter aircraft later used the tactic of high-speed strafing passes rather than engaging with individual aircraft to inflict damage with minimum risk.

As a result, the B-17s' loss rate was up to 25% on some early missions (60 of 291 B-17s were lost in combat on the second [[Raid on Schweinfurt]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Caidin&quot;/&gt;), and it was not until the advent of long-range fighter escorts (particularly the [[North American P-51 Mustang]]) resulting in the degradation of the ''Luftwaffe'' as an effective interceptor force between February and June 1944, that the B-17 became strategically potent.

[[File:B-17 Schweinfurt.jpg|thumb|Formation flying through dense [[flak]] over [[Merseburg]], Germany]]
The B-17 was noted for its ability to absorb battle damage, still reach its target and bring its crew home safely. Wally Hoffman, a B-17 pilot with the Eighth Air Force during World War&amp;nbsp;II, said, &quot;The plane can be cut and slashed almost to pieces by enemy fire and bring its crew home.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman&quot;/&gt; [[Martin Caidin]] reported one instance in which a B-17 suffered a mid-air collision with a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]], losing an engine and suffering serious damage to both the starboard horizontal stabilizer and the vertical stabilizer, and being knocked out of formation by the impact. The B-17 was reported as shot down by observers, but it survived and brought its crew home without injury.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caidin.p86&quot;/&gt; Its toughness was compensation for its shorter range and lighter bomb load compared to the B-24 and British [[Avro Lancaster]] heavy bombers.{{Clarify|is this statement backed by the ref for the following sentence?|date=June 2010}} Stories abound of B-17s returning to base with tails having been destroyed, with only a single engine functioning or even with large portions of wings having been damaged by [[Anti-aircraft warfare|flak]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DurableB-17Colorado&quot;/&gt; This durability, together with the large operational numbers in the [[Eighth Air Force]] and the fame achieved by the ''[[Memphis Belle (B-17)|Memphis Belle]]'', made the B-17 a key bomber aircraft of the war. Other factors such as combat effectiveness and political issues also contributed to the B-17's success.&lt;ref name=&quot;B17vB24&quot;/&gt;

The B-17 design went through eight major changes over the course of its production, culminating in the B-17G, differing from its immediate predecessor by the addition of a bombardier-operated, remotely controlled chin [[gun turret|turret]] with two {{convert|.50|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} caliber [[M2 Browning machine gun]]s under the nose, also fitted to the final eighty-six production aircraft of the B-17F-DLs built by Douglas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.b17queenofthesky.com/variants/prototype.php?id=12&amp;tle=B-17F |title=B17 — Queen of the Sky — The B-17F |last=Lyman |first=Troy  |date=12 May 2003 |website=http://www.b17queenofthesky.com/ |publisher=Troy Lyman's B-17 Flying Fortress Site |accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; after being first tried in May 1943 as part of the increased armament system of the YB-40. This eliminated the B-17's main defensive weakness in head-on attacks.

===The Luftwaffe===
[[File:B-17-battle-casualty1.gif|thumb|The severely damaged B-17, &quot;All-American&quot; continues to fly after an attacking [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109 fighter]] collided with the aircraft. The B-17 flew home and landed in this condition without major injuries to any of the crew members.]]
After examining wrecked B-17s and B-24s, Luftwaffe officers discovered that on average it took around 20 hits with [[MG 151 cannon|20 mm]] shells fired from the rear to bring them down.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFM.76-9&quot;/&gt; Pilots of average ability hit the bombers with only about two percent of the rounds they fired, so to obtain 20 hits, the average pilot had to fire one thousand {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} rounds at a bomber.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFM.76-9&quot;/&gt; Early versions of the [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190|Fw 190]], one of the best German interceptor fighters, were equipped with two {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[MG FF cannon|MG FF]] cannons, which carried only 500 rounds when belt-fed (normally using 60-round [[drum magazine]]s in earlier installations), and later with the better [[MG 151 cannon|Mauser MG 151/20]] cannons, which had a longer effective range than the MG FF weapon. Later versions carried four or even six MG151/20 cannon and twin 13&amp;nbsp;mm machine guns.  The German fighters found that when attacking from the front, where fewer defensive guns were mounted (and where the pilot was exposed and not protected by armor as he was from the rear), it took only four or five hits to bring a bomber down.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFM.76-9&quot;/&gt; To address the Fw 190's shortcomings, the number of cannons fitted was doubled to four with a corresponding increase in the amount of ammunition carried, creating [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190 operational history#The Sturmböcke|the ''Sturmbock'']] bomber destroyer version. This type replaced the vulnerable twin-engined ''Zerstörer'' heavy fighters which could not survive interception by P-51 Mustangs flying well ahead of the combat boxes in an [[air supremacy]] role starting very early in 1944, to clear any Luftwaffe defensive fighters from the skies. By 1944, a further upgrade to [[Rheinmetall]]-[[Borsig]]'s {{convert|30|mm|in|abbr=on}} [[MK 108 cannon]]s mounted either in the wing, or in underwing, conformal mount gun pods, was made for the ''Sturmbock'' Focke-Wulfs as either the [[Rüstsatz|/R2 or /R8 field modification kits]], enabling aircraft to bring a bomber down with just a few hits.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFM.76-9&quot;/&gt;

The adoption of the [[21 cm Nebelwerfer 42|21 cm Nebelwerfer]]-derived ''[[Werfer-Granate 21]]'' (Wfr. Gr. 21) rocket mortar by the Luftwaffe in mid-August 1943 promised the introduction of a major &quot;stand-off&quot; style of offensive weapon&amp;nbsp;– one strut-mounted tubular launcher was fixed under each wing panel on the Luftwaffe's single-engined fighters, and two under each wing panel of a few twin-engined [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Bf 110]] daylight ''Zerstörer'' aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFM.76-9&quot;/&gt; However, due to the slow 715&amp;nbsp;mph velocity and characteristic [[Bullet drop|ballistic drop]] of the fired rocket (despite the usual mounting of the launcher at about 15° upward orientation), and the small number of fighters fitted with the weapons, the Wfr. Gr. 21 never had a major effect on the combat box formations of Fortresses.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFM.76-9&quot;/&gt; The Luftwaffe also fitted heavy-calibre ''Bordkanone''-series 37, 50 and even {{convert|75|mm|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} cannon as anti-bomber weapons on twin-engined aircraft such as the special [[Junkers Ju 88|Ju 88P]] fighters, as well as one model of the [[Messerschmitt Me 410|Me 410]] ''Hornisse'' but these measures did not have much effect on the American strategic bomber offensive. The [[Messerschmitt Me 262|Me 262]], however, had moderate success against the B-17 late in the war. With its usual nose-mounted armament of four [[MK 108 cannon]]s, and with some examples later equipped with the [[R4M rocket]], launched from underwing racks, it could fire from outside the range of the bombers' {{convert|.50|in|mm|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} defensive guns and bring an aircraft down with one hit,&lt;ref name=&quot;Schollars&quot;/&gt; as both the MK 108's shells and the R4M's warheads were filled with the &quot;shattering&quot; force of the strongly [[Brisance|brisant]] [[RDX|Hexogen]] military explosive.

===Luftwaffe-captured B-17s===
During World War II, after crash-landing or being forced down, approximately 40 B-17s were captured and refurbished, with about a dozen put back into the air. Given German ''[[Balkenkreuz]]'' national markings on their wings and fuselage sides, and ''[[Nazi swastika|&quot;Hakenkreuz&quot; swastika]]'' tail fin-flashes, the captured B-17s were used to determine the B-17's vulnerabilities and to train German interceptor pilots in attack tactics.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p89&quot;/&gt; Others, with the cover designations Dornier Do 200 and Do 288, were used as long-range transports by the [[Kampfgeschwader 200|''Kampfgeschwader'' 200]] special duties unit, carrying out agent drops and supplying secret airstrips in the Middle East and North Africa. They were chosen specifically for these missions as being more suitable for this role than other available German aircraft; they never attempted to deceive the Allies and always wore full ''Luftwaffe'' markings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Donald Am p23&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wixley p30&quot;/&gt; One B-17 of KG200, bearing the ''Luftwaffe's'' KG 200 ''Geschwaderkennung'' (combat wing code) markings ''A3+FB'', was interned by Spain when it landed at [[Valencia]] airfield, {{Nowrap|27 June}} 1944, remaining there for the rest of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Northstar&quot;/&gt; It has been alleged that some B-17s kept their Allied markings and were used by the ''Luftwaffe'' in attempts to infiltrate B-17 bombing formations and report on their positions and altitudes. According to these allegations, the practice was initially successful, but Army Air Force combat aircrews quickly developed and established standard procedures to first warn off, and then fire upon any &quot;stranger&quot; trying to join a group's formation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Northstar&quot;/&gt;{{Verify source|date=June 2010}}

===Soviet-interned B-17s===
The U.S. did not offer B-17s to the Soviet Union as part of its war materiel assistance program, but at least 73 aircraft were acquired by the [[Soviet Air Force]]. These aircraft had landed with mechanical trouble during the [[Operation Frantic|shuttle bombing raids]] over Germany or had been damaged by a ''Luftwaffe'' raid in [[Poltava]]. The Soviets restored 23 to flying condition and concentrated them in the 890th bomber regiment of the 45th bomber division, but they never saw combat. In 1946 the regiment was assigned to the [[Kazan]] factory to aid in the Soviet effort to reproduce the more advanced [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|Boeing B-29]] as the [[Tupolev Tu-4]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon p. 479&quot;&gt;Gordon 2008, p. 479.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swiss-interned B-17s===
During the war, the [[Strategic bombing during World War II|Allied bomber offensive]] sometimes took U.S. or British bombers into Swiss airspace, either damaged craft seeking safe haven or on rare occasions [[Bombings of Switzerland in World War II|bombing Swiss cities]] by accident. Swiss aircraft would attempt to intercept and force individual aircraft to land, interning their crews; one Swiss pilot was killed, shot down by a U. S. bomber crew in September 1944. From then on, red and white neutrality bands were added to the wings of Swiss aircraft to stop accidental attacks by Allied aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swiss Morane|url = http://www.ww2incolor.com/other/SWISS-MS406.html |work= WW2 in color |accessdate=5 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Official Swiss records identify 6,501 airspace violations during the course of the war, with 198 foreign aircraft landing on Swiss territory and 56 aircraft crashing there. One prime example: in October 1943 the Swiss [[interned]] Boeing B-17F-25-VE, tail number 25841, and her U. S. flight crew after the Flying Fortress developed engine trouble and was forced to land following its bombing raid over Germany. The aircraft was then turned over to the [[Swiss Air Force]], who then flew the bomber until the end of the war, using other interned but non-flyable B-17s for spare parts. The bomber was repainted a dark [[olive drab]], but retained its light gray-painted under surfaces. It carried Swiss national white cross insignia in red squares on both sides of its rudder, fuselage sides, and the underside wings, with white crosses in red [[roundel]]s atop both upper wings. As on its gray under surfaces, the B-17F also carried light gray flash letters &quot;RD&quot; and &quot;I&quot; on either side of the Swiss national insignia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cravens, Wesley 1956&quot;/&gt;

===Japanese-captured B-17s===
[[File:B17jp.jpg|thumb|This Philippines-captured USAAF Boeing B-17D, in Japanese markings, was flown to Japan for thorough technical evaluation.]]

Three damaged B-17s, one &quot;D&quot; model and two &quot;E&quot; models, were rebuilt to flying status by Japanese technicians and mechanics; the parts used were stripped from captured B-17 wrecks in both the Philippines and the Netherlands East Indies. The three bombers, containing captured top secret [[Norden Bombsight]]s, were then flown to Japan where they underwent extensive technical evaluation by the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force]]'s Air Technical Research Laboratory (Koku Gijutsu Kenkyujo). The &quot;D&quot; model was later deemed an obsolete design and the two &quot;E&quot; models were used to develop B-17 air combat counter-tactics; they were also used as enemy aircraft in several Japanese propaganda films. No traces of these captured Flying Fortresses were found in Japan by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] occupation forces following the war; they were assumed scrapped late in the war for their vital war materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p314&quot;/&gt;

===Postwar history===

====U.S. Air Force====
[[File:QB-17 Flying Fortress Drones over New Mexico 1946.jpg|thumb|left|BQ-17 Flying Fortress Drones over New Mexico, April 1946.]]
Following the end of World War II, the B-17 was quickly phased out of use as a bomber and the Army Air Forces retired most of its fleet. Flight crews ferried the bombers back across the Atlantic to the United States where the majority were sold for scrap and melted down, although significant numbers remained in use in second-line roles such as VIP transports, air-sea rescue and photo-reconnaissance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swan mil p80&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p290&quot;/&gt; [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC), established in 1946, used reconnaissance B-17s (at first called F-9 [''F'' for ''Fotorecon''], later RB-17) until 1949.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p310-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Knaack bomber p465&quot;/&gt;  With the disestablishment of the U.S. Army Air Forces and the establishment of an independent [[U.S. Air Force]] in 1947, most extant B-17s were transferred to USAF.

The USAF [[Air Rescue Service]] of the [[Military Air Transport Service]] (MATS) operated B-17s as so-called [[Dumbo (air-sea rescue)|&quot;Dumbo&quot;]] [[air-sea rescue]] aircraft. Work on using B-17s to carry [[airborne lifeboat]]s had begun in 1943, but they entered service in the European theater only in February 1945, also being used to provide search and rescue support for [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress|B-29]] raids against Japan. About 130 B-17s were converted to the air-sea rescue role, at first designated B-17H and later SB-17G. Some SB-17s had their defensive guns removed, while others retained their guns to allow use close to combat areas. The SB-17 served through the [[Korean War]], remaining in service with USAF until the mid-1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p303-4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p86&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p89-0&quot;/&gt;

In 1946, surplus B-17s were chosen as [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone aircraft]] for atmospheric sampling during the [[Operation Crossroads]] atomic bomb tests, being able to fly close to or even through the [[mushroom cloud]]s without endangering a crew. This led to more widespread conversion of B-17s as drones and drone control aircraft, both for further use in atomic testing and as targets for testing [[surface-to-air missile|surface-to-air]] and [[air-to-air missile]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p91&quot;/&gt; {{nowrap|One hundred and seven B-17s}} were converted to drones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flight Sperry&quot;/&gt; The last operational mission flown by a USAF Fortress was conducted on {{Nowrap|6 August}} 1959, when a DB-17P, serial '' 44-83684 '' directed a QB-17G, out of [[Holloman Air Force Base]], New Mexico, as a target for an [[AIM-4 Falcon]] air-to-air missile fired from an [[McDonnell F-101 Voodoo]]. A retirement ceremony was held several days later at Holloman AFB, after which ''44-83684'' was retired.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} It was subsequently used in movies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://warbirdregistry.org/b17registry/b17-4483684.html B-17 Flying Fortress 44-83684]&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most famous B-17, the ''[[Memphis Belle (aircraft)|Memphis Belle]]'', is currently being fastidiously restored — simultaneously with the B-17D ''The Swoose'' — to its World War II wartime appearance by the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] at [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]], Ohio.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMAF Memphis&quot;/&gt;

During the last year of World War II and shortly thereafter, the [[United States Navy]] acquired 48 ex-USAAF B-17s for patrol and air-sea rescue work. The first two ex-USAAF B-17s, a B-17F (later modified to B-17G standard) and a B-17G were obtained by the Navy for various development programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p310-1&quot;/&gt; At first, these aircraft operated under their original USAAF designations but on 31 July 1945, they were assigned the naval aircraft designation PB-1, a designation which had originally been used in 1925 for the [[Boeing Model 50]] experimental flying boat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swan Navy&quot;/&gt;

Thirty-two B-17Gs&lt;ref name=&quot;DABASv2 p661&quot;/&gt; were used by the Navy under the designation PB-1W, the suffix -W airborne early warning. A large radome for an [[S-band]] [[List of radars|AN/APS-20]] search radar was fitted underneath the fuselage and additional internal fuel tanks were added for longer range, with the provision for additional underwing fuel tanks. Originally, the B-17 was also chosen because of its heavy defensive armament, but this was later deleted. These aircraft were painted dark blue, a standard Navy paint scheme which had been adopted in late 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p310-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Swan Navy&quot;/&gt; The PB-1W eventually evolved into an early warning aircraft by virtue of its APS-20 search radar.&lt;ref name=&quot;DABASv2 p661&quot;/&gt; PB-1Ws continued in USN service until 1955, gradually being phased out in favor of the Lockheed WV-2 (known in the USAF as the [[EC-121]], a designation adopted by USN in 1962), a military version of the [[Lockheed Constellation|Lockheed 1049 Constellation]] commercial airliner.

In July 1945, 16 B-17s were transferred to the Coast Guard via the Navy; these aircraft were initially assigned U.S. Navy Bureau Numbers (BuNo), but were delivered to the Coast Guard designated as PB-1Gs beginning in July 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p310-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p89-0&quot;/&gt; Coast Guard PB-1Gs were stationed at a number of bases in the U.S. and Newfoundland, with five at [[Coast Guard Air Station Elizabeth City]], North Carolina, two at [[San Francisco International Airport|CGAS San Francisco]], two at [[NAS Argentia]], Newfoundland, one at [[CGAS Kodiak]], Alaska, and one in Washington state.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p89-0&quot;/&gt; They were used primarily for air-sea rescue, but were also used for iceberg patrol duties and for photo mapping. Air-sea rescue PB-1Gs usually carried a droppable lifeboat underneath the fuselage and the chin turret was often replaced by a radome.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p89-0&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot;/&gt; The Coast Guard PB-1Gs served throughout the 1950s, the last example not being withdrawn from service until 14 October 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowers Boeing p310-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USCG&quot;/&gt;

===Special operations===
A number of B-17s were used by the CIA front companies Civil Air Transport, Air America and Intermountain Aviation for special missions. These included B-17G ''44-85531'', registered as N809Z. These aircraft were primarily used for agent drop missions over the People's Republic of China, flying from Taiwan, with Taiwanese crews. Four B-17s were shot down in these operations.&lt;ref&gt;Pocock, Chris. ''The Black Bats: CIA Spy Flights Over China From Taiwan, 1951–1969''. Atglen, Pennsylvania: Schiffer Military History, 2010. ISBN 978-0-7643-3513-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 the surviving B-17s had been stripped of all weapons and painted black. One of these Taiwan-based B-17s was flown to [[Clark Air Base]] in the Philippines in mid-September, assigned for covert missions into Tibet.

On 28 May 1962, N809Z, piloted by Connie Seigrist and Douglas Price, flew Major James Smith, USAF and Lieutenant Leonard A. LeSchack, USNR to the abandoned Soviet arctic ice station NP 8, as [[Operation Coldfeet]]. Smith and LeSchack parachuted from the B-17 and searched the station for several days. On 1 June, Seigrist and Price returned and picked up Smith and LeSchack using a [[Fulton Skyhook]] system installed on the B-17.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.utdallas.edu/library/collections/speccoll/Leeker/b17.pdf &quot;The Boeing B-17s.&quot;] ''utdallas.edu.'' Retrieved: 25 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; N809Z was used to perform a Skyhook pick up in the James Bond movie ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' in 1965. This aircraft, now restored to its original B-17G configuration, is on display in the [[Evergreen Aviation &amp; Space Museum]] in [[McMinnville, Oregon]].

The B-17 was a versatile aircraft, serving in dozens of USAAF units in theaters of combat throughout World War&amp;nbsp;II, and in non-bomber roles for the RAF. Its main use was in [[European Theatre of World War II|Europe]], where its shorter range and smaller bombload relative to other aircraft available did not hamper it as much as in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific Theater]].

The B-17 Flying Fortress has become, for many reasons, an icon of American power and a symbol of its Air Force. During the 1930s, the USAAC, as articulated by then-Major General [[Frank Maxwell Andrews]] and the [[Air Corps Tactical School]], touted the bomber as a strategic weapon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tate.149&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref group=N&gt;Quote: &quot;The Howell Commission's report&amp;nbsp;... stated '... an adequate striking force for use against objectives both near and remote is a necessity for a modern army&amp;nbsp;...{{'&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; General [[Henry H. Arnold]], Chief of the Air Corps, recommended the development of bigger aircraft with better performance, and the Tactical School agreed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tate.161&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref group=N&gt;Quote: &quot;To them it seemed that the bomber was well-nigh invincible. They argued that pursuit was obsolete and attack an expensive luxury, since aviation was more effective when used for interdiction behind enemy lines and strategic bombardment to destroy the enemy's means and will to fight.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Model 299 was rolled out on {{Nowrap|28 July}} 1935, bristling with multiple [[machine gun]] installations, Richard Williams, a reporter for ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' coined the name &quot;Flying Fortress&quot; with his comment, &quot;Why, it's a flying fortress!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Meilinger 87&quot;/&gt; Boeing was quick to see the value of the name and had it trademarked for use.&lt;ref group=N&gt;The ''Air Corps News Letter'', however, notes in its 1 January 1938 edition ([http://newpreview.afnews.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-110421-039.pdf ACNL Volume XXI, Number 1, page 7]) an attempt by the Langley Field correspondent to apply the appellation &quot;Jeep&quot; to the B-17, which it objected to as &quot;not befitting&quot; the aircraft and adding, &quot;Why not let the term 'Flying Fortress' suffice?&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943, [[Consolidated Aircraft]] commissioned a poll to see &quot;to what degree the public is familiar with the names of the Liberator and the Flying Fortress.&quot; Of 2,500 men in cities where Consolidated adverts had been run in newspapers, 73% had heard of the B-24, while 90% knew of the B-17.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnsen 2006&quot;/&gt;

After the initial B-17s were delivered to the Air Corps 2nd Bombardment Group, they were used on promotional flights emphasizing their great range and navigational precision. In January 1938, group commander [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Robert Olds]] flew a YB-17 from the east to west coast, setting a transcontinental record of 13 hours 27 minutes. He also broke the west-to-east coast record on the return trip, averaging {{convert|245|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in 11 hours 1 minute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zamzow&quot;/&gt; Six bombers of the 2nd Bombardment group took off from [[Langley Field]] on {{Nowrap|15 February}} 1938 as part of a goodwill flight to [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]]. Covering {{convert|12000|mi|km}} they returned on {{Nowrap|27 February}}, with seven aircraft setting off on a flight to [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, three days later.&lt;ref name=&quot;WoF p46-7&quot;/&gt; In a well-publicized mission on 12 May of the same year, three B-17s &quot;intercepted&quot; and took photographs of the Italian ocean liner [[SS Rex|SS ''Rex'']] {{convert|610|mi|km}} off the Atlantic coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;AFM.91-12&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref group=N&gt;This is a common error. The ''Rex'' was 725 miles offshore on her last position report as the B-17s were taxiing for takeoff from Mitchel Field, four hours before interception.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilots who flew both preferred the B-17 over the B-24 for its greater stability and ease in formation flying. Its electrical systems were less vulnerable to damage than the B-24's hydraulics, and the B-17 flew better than the B-24 when missing an engine.&lt;ref name=&quot;levine1992&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=The Strategic Bombing of Germany, 1940–1945 | publisher=Praeger | author=Levine, Alan J. | year=1992 | location=Westport, Connecticut | pages=14–15 | isbn=0-275-94319-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, the largest offensive bombing force, the [[Eighth Air Force]], had an open preference for the B-17. [[Lieutenant General]] [[Jimmy Doolittle]] wrote about his preference for equipping the Eighth with B-17s, citing the logistical advantage in keeping field forces down to a minimum number of aircraft types with their individual servicing and spares. For this reason, he wanted B-17 bombers and P-51 fighters for the Eighth. His views were supported by Eighth Air Force statisticians, whose studies showed that Fortresses had utility and survivability much greater than that of the B-24.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnsen 2006&quot;/&gt; Making it back to base on numerous occasions despite extensive battle damage, its durability became mythical;&lt;ref name=&quot;Manual&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=browne/&gt; stories and photos of B-17s surviving battle damage were widely circulated during the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnsen 2006&quot;/&gt; Despite an inferior performance and smaller bombload than the more numerous B-24,&lt;ref name=&quot;Birdsall 3&quot;/&gt; a survey of Eighth Air Force crews showed a much higher rate of satisfaction in the B-17.&lt;ref name=&quot;B-17.de&quot;/&gt;

[[Classical Hollywood cinema|Hollywood]] featured the B-17 in its period films, such as director [[Howard Hawks]]' ''[[Air Force (film)|Air Force]]'' starring [[John Garfield]] and ''[[Twelve O'Clock High]]'' starring [[Gregory Peck]].&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb1&quot;/&gt; Both films were made with the full cooperation of the [[United States Army Air Forces]] and used USAAF aircraft and (for ''Twelve O'Clock High'') combat footage. In 1964, the latter film was made into a [[Twelve O'Clock High (TV series)|television show of the same name]] and ran for three years on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC TV]]. Footage from ''Twelve O' Clock High'' was also used, along with three restored B-17s, in the 1962 film ''[[The War Lover]]''.  The B-17 also appeared in the 1938 movie ''[[Test Pilot (film)|Test Pilot]]'' with [[Clark Gable]] and [[Spencer Tracy]], with Clark Gable in ''[[Command Decision (film)|Command Decision]]'' in 1948, in ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]'' in 1970, and in ''[[Memphis Belle (film)|Memphis Belle]]'' with [[Matthew Modine]], [[Eric Stoltz]], [[Billy Zane]], and [[Harry Connick, Jr.]] in 1990. The most famous B-17, the ''[[Memphis Belle (B-17)|Memphis Belle]]'', toured the U. S. with its crew to reinforce national morale (and to sell [[war bond]]s). It starred in a USAAF documentary, ''[[Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb2&quot;/&gt;

The B-17 has also been featured in artistic works expressing the physical and psychological stress of the combat conditions and the high casualty rates that crews suffered.&lt;ref&gt;Philo, Tom.
