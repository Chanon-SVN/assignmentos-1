==Background==
When Alaska became a state in 1959, section 4 of the [[Alaska Statehood Act]] provided that any existing Alaska Native land claims would be unaffected by statehood and held in status quo.&lt;ref name=jones&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Richard S.|title=ALASKA NATIVE CLAIMS SETTLEMENT ACT OF 1971  (PUBLIC LAW 92-203): HISTORY AND ANALYSIS TOGETHER WITH SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS Report No. 81-127 GOV|url=http://www.alaskool.org/projects/ancsa/reports/rsjones1981/ANCSA_History71_Ftnts.htm#28|publisher=alaskool.org (June 1, 1981)|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=statehood&gt;{{cite web|title=Alaska Statehood Act Public Law 85-508, 72 Stat. 339, July 7, 1958|url=http://www.lbblawyers.com/ancsa/state6.htm|website=lbblawyers.com|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet while section 4 of the act preserved Native land claims until later settlement, section 6 allowed for the state government to claim lands deemed vacant.&lt;ref name=statehood/&gt; Section 6 granted the state of Alaska the right to select lands then in the hands of the federal government, with the exception of Native territory, so that nearly {{convert|104.5|e6acre|km2}} from the public domain would eventually be transferred to the state.&lt;ref name=jones2&gt;{{cite web|last1=Richard S.|first1=Jones|title=ALASKA NATIVE CLAIMS SETTLEMENT ACT OF 1971 (PUBLIC LAW 92-203): HISTORY AND ANALYSIS TOGETHER WITH SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS: Introduction|url=http://www.alaskool.org/projects/ancsa/reports/rsjones1981/ancsa_history71.htm|publisher=alaskool.org|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=statehood/&gt; All the same, the state government attempted to acquire lands under section 6 of the Statehood Act that were subject to Native claims under section 4, and that were currently occupied and used by Alaska Natives.&lt;ref name=jones2/&gt; The federal [[Bureau of Land Management]] began to process the Alaska government's selections without taking into account the Native claims and without informing the affected Native groups.&lt;ref name=jones2/&gt;

Alaska Natives had three years from passage of ANCSA to make land selections of the {{convert|44|e6acre|km2}} granted under the act.&lt;ref name=section1611&gt;{{cite web|title=43 U.S. Code § 1611 - Native land selections|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/43/1611|publisher=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases corporations received outside aid in surveying the land.&lt;ref name=haynes/&gt; For instance, [[Doyon, Limited]] (one of the 13 [[Alaska native corporation|regional corporations]]) was helped by the Geophysical Institute of the [[University of Alaska]].&lt;ref name=haynes/&gt; The Institute determined which land contained resources such as minerals and coal.&lt;ref name=haynes/&gt; [[NASA]] similarly provided satellite imagery to aid in finding areas most suited for vegetation and subsistence.&lt;ref name=haynes/&gt; The imagery also showed locations of caribou and moose, as well as forests with marketable timber.&lt;ref name=haynes/&gt; In total about {{convert|7|e6acre|km2}} were analyzed for Doyon.&lt;ref name=haynes/&gt; Natives were able to choose tens of thousands of acres of land rich with timber while Doyon used mineral analysis to attract businesses.&lt;ref name=haynes&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haynes|first1=James B.|title=Land Selection and Development under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act|journal=Arctic Institute of North America|date=September 1975|volume=28 |issue=3|pages=201-208|url=http://pubs.aina.ucalgary.ca/arctic/Arctic28-3-201.pdf|accessdate=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
