'''Aldona''' (baptized ''Ona'' or ''Anna''; her [[pagan]] name, Aldona, is known only from the writings of [[Maciej Stryjkowski]];&lt;ref name=aldona2/&gt; c. 1309 –  26 May 1339) was [[Queen consort]] of [[Piast Poland|Poland]] (1333–1339), and a princess of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. She was the daughter of [[Gediminas]], Grand Duke of Lithuania.

==Biography==
Aldona married [[Casimir III of Poland]], when he was 15 or 16 years old. The bride was probably of about the same age. The marriage took place on 30 April or 16 October 1325 and was a purely [[Political marriage|political maneuver]] to strengthen the first [[Poland|Polish]]–[[Lithuania]]n coalition against the [[Teutonic Knights]].&lt;ref name=aldona&gt;{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia | last=Jonynas | first=Ignas | editor=Vaclovas Biržiška | encyclopedia=Lietuviškoji enciklopedija | title=Aldona | year=1933 | publisher=Spaudos Fondas | volume=I | location=Kaunas | pages=208–211}}&lt;/ref&gt; Casimir was seeking allies in the dispute over [[Pomerania]] with the Order. Gediminas had just undertaken an unsuccessful attempt to Christianize Lithuania. This coalition was a prelude to the [[Union of Krewo]] in 1385, and the [[Union of Lublin]] in 1569, which resulted in the creation of a new state, the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].&lt;ref name=aldona2&gt;{{lt icon}} {{cite encyclopedia |first=Edvardas |last=Gudavičius | authorlink=Edvardas Gudavičius | editor= Vytautas Spečiūnas |encyclopedia= Lietuvos valdovai (XIII-XVIII a.): enciklopedinis žinynas |title=Aldona |year=2004 |publisher=[[Mokslo ir enciklopedijų leidybos institutas]] |location=[[Vilnius]] |pages=40 |isbn=5-420-01535-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The details of the agreement are not known; however, it is known that Gediminas released all Polish captives, numbered at around 25,000, who returned to Poland.&lt;ref name=aldona/&gt; The importance of the marriage was attested by the fact that Władysław abandoned his earlier plans to marry his son to [[Jutta of Bohemia]].&lt;ref name=pious&gt;{{cite journal | first=S.

Yet, there is no evidence of fighting between Poland and Lithuania while Aldona was alive.&lt;ref name=aldona/&gt; Aldona died suddenly at the end of May 1339, and was buried in [[Kraków]].

Aldona was remembered for her [[piety]] and devotion to music. She was accompanied by court musicians wherever she went. It was even suggested by [[Jan Długosz]] that the [[cymbal]]s which were played in procession before her represented a [[Lithuanian mythology|pagan Lithuanian]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Rowell, C. S. ''Lithuania Ascending'', 232.&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband Casimir is known for his romantic affairs: after Aldona's death he married three more times. Aldona had two daughters:
* Cunigunde of Poland (died in 1357); married on  1 January 1345 [[Louis VI the Roman]], the son of [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor]].
* [[Elisabeth of Poland (1326–1361)|Elisabeth]] (1326-1361); married [[Bogislaus V]], [[Duke of Pomerania]].&lt;ref&gt;Rowell, C. S. ''Lithuania Ascending'', xxxvi&lt;/ref&gt; Elisabeth's daughter, [[Elizabeth of Pomerania]], was the fourth wife of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]].
