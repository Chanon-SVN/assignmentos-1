'''Abakan''' ({{lang-rus|Абакан|p=ɐbɐˈkan}}; [[Khakas language|Khakas]]: {{lang|kjh|Ағбан}}) is the [[capital city]] of the [[Republic of Khakassia]], [[Russia]], located in the central part of [[Minusinsk Depression]], at the [[confluence]] of the [[Yenisei River|Yenisei]] and [[Abakan River]]s. As of the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Census]], it had a population of 165,214,&lt;ref name=&quot;2010Census&quot;&gt;{{ru-pop-ref|2010Census}}&lt;/ref&gt; a slight increase over 165,197 recorded during the [[Russian Census (2002)|2002 Census]]&lt;ref name=&quot;2002Census&quot;&gt;{{ru-pop-ref|2002Census}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a further increase from 154,092 recorded during the [[Soviet Census (1989)|1989 Census]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1989Census&quot;&gt;{{ru-pop-ref|1989Census}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Abakansky ''[[ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]]'' ({{lang|ru|Абаканский острог}}) was built at this location in 1675,&lt;ref name=&quot;gr&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Энциклопедия Города России|trans_title=&quot;Cities and Towns of Russia&quot; Encyclopedia|year=2003|publisher=Большая Российская Энциклопедия|location=Moscow|isbn=5-7107-7399-9|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Abakansk'''. In the [[Russian Empire]], it was a part of [[Yeniseysk Governorate]]. During 1823–1931, it was known as '''Ust-Abakanskoye''', in 1914–1925 as Abakan, and in 1925–1931 as '''Khakassk'''. It was granted town status and given its current name in 1931.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

===Chinese exiles===
In 1940, Russian construction workers found ancient ruins during the construction of a highway between Abakan and the nearby district center village of Askyz (Аскыз). When the site was excavated by Soviet archaeologists during 1941-45, they realized that they had discovered a building absolutely unique for the area: a large (1500 square meters) Chinese-style, likely [[Han Dynasty]] era (206 BCE–220 CE) palace. The identity of the high-ranking personage who lived luxuriously in Chinese style, far outside of the borders of the Han Empire, has remained a matter for discussion ever since. Russian archaeologist L. A. Yevtyukhova surmised, based on circumstantial evidence, that the palace may have been the residence of [[Li Ling (Han Dynasty)|Li Ling]], a Chinese general who had been defeated by the [[Xiongnu]] in 99 BC, and defected to them as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Yevtyukhova|1954}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this opinion has remained popular, other views have been expressed as well.  More recently, for example, it was claimed by A. A. Kovalyov as the residence of Lu Fang ([[:zh:卢芳|盧芳]]), a [[Han Dynasty|Han]] throne pretender from the [[Emperor Guangwu of Han|Guangwu]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kovalyov|2007|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lithuanian exiles===
In the late eighteenth and during the nineteenth century, Lithuanian participants in the 1794, 1830–1831, and 1863 rebellions against the Russian [[czar]]ist rule were exiled to Abakan. A group of [[Labor camp|camp]]s was established, and prisoners were forced to work in the coal mines. After [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s death, Lithuanian exiles from the nearby settlements moved in.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Juodvalkytė|2001}}{{page needed|date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative and municipal status==
Abakan is the [[capital city|capital]] of the republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref54&quot;&gt;Law #20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|1993|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is incorporated as the '''[[City of federal subject significance|City]] of Abakan'''—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of the Republic of Khakassia|districts]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref54&quot; /&gt; As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the City of Abakan is incorporated as '''Abakan Urban Okrug'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref741&quot;&gt;Law #59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
Abakan has a continental climate with semi-arid influences (Köppen climate classification &quot;BSk&quot;). Temperature differences between seasons are extreme, which is typical for Siberia. Precipitation is concentrated in the summer and is less common because of rain shadow from nearby mountains.
