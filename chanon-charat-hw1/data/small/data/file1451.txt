'''Aeclanum''' (also spelled '''Aeculanum''', {{lang-it|Eclano}}) was an ancient town of [[Samnium]], southern [[Italy]], c. 25&amp;nbsp;km east-southeast of [[Beneventum]], on the [[Via Appia]] (near the modern [[Mirabella Eclano]]).

== Location ==

Aeclanum was on a promontory naturally defended, to some extent, by a steep slope on the south side down to the river Calore, while the north side lay open towards the crest of the ridge that carried what under the [[Roman Empire]] became the [[Via Appia]]. This led through [[Ampsanctus|Lacus Ampsanctus]] to [[Aquilonia]] and [[Venusia]]. Another route to [[Apulia]], the Via Aurelia Aeclanensis diverged here, leading through modern [[Ariano]] to [[Herdoniae]]. The road from Aeclanum to [[Abellinum]] (mod.  [[Avellino]]) may also follow an ancient line. Today there are ruins of the city walls, of an [[aqueduct (Roman)|aqueduct]], baths and an [[amphitheatre]]; nearly 400 inscriptions have also been discovered. Excavation has revealed a long history of pre-Roman settlement.&lt;ref name=Princeton&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0006:id=aeclanum &quot;AECLANUM (Eclano) Italy&quot; in ''The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Aeclanum |volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spazioinwind.libero.it/popoli_antichi/altro/Aeclanum.html Aeclanum]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Aeclanum became the chief town of the [[Hirpini]], after [[Benevento|Beneventum]] had become a [[Rome|Roman]] [[colony]]. [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]] captured it in 89 BC by setting on fire the wooden breastwork by which it was defended, and sacked it. It quickly recovered, new fortifications were erected, and it became a ''[[municipium]]''. [[Hadrian]], who repaired the Via Appia from Beneventum to this point, made it a ''[[colonia (Roman)|colonia]]''. With the [[Lombards|Lombard]] invasion of Italy it was annexed to the [[Duchy of Benevento]], but was captured and destroyed by [[Byzantine Empire]] under [[Constans II]] in 663 and never recovered, being reduced to a small hamlet known as Quintodecimo, a name that referred to its distance of 15 miles from Benevento.&lt;ref name=Princeton/&gt;&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

== Bishopric ==

Aeclanum became a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[episcopal see]], whose best known [[bishop]] was [[Julian of Eclanum]], who was consecrated by [[Pope Innocent I]] in about 417. He refused to sign the condemnation of [[Pelagianism]] issued by Pope Innocent's successor, [[Pope Zosimus]], and carried on a war of writings against [[Augustine of Hippo]]. It has been thought that the diocese was united to that of [[Frigento|Frequentium]] as early as the 5th century, but there is mention of Quintodecimo as a [[suffragan]] see of Benevento in 969 and 1058. From 1059 it was definitively united with Frequentium.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Cappelletti, [http://books.google.com/books?id=JdUCAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA180 ''Le Chiese d'Italia dalla loro origine sino ai nostri giorni''], Venezia 1864, vol. XIX, p.&amp;nbsp;180&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diocesi.avellino.it/index.asp?sez=Vescovi Storia della diocesi di Avellino]&lt;/ref&gt; No longer a residential bishopric, Aeclanum is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].&lt;ref&gt;''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 ISBN 978-88-209-9070-1), p. 884&lt;/ref&gt;
