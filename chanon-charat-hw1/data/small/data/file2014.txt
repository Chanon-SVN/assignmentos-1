'''Bassas da India''' is an uninhabited, roughly circular [[atoll]] that is part of the [[French Southern and Antarctic Lands]]. Located in the southern [[Mozambique Channel]], about halfway between [[Mozambique]] and [[Madagascar]] (about {{convert|385|km|0|abbr=on}} further east) and around {{convert|110|km|0|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Europa Island]], the rim of the atoll averages around 100&amp;nbsp;m in width and encloses a shallow [[lagoon]] of depth no greater than 15&amp;nbsp;m. Overall, the atoll is about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, rising steeply from the [[seabed]] 3000&amp;nbsp;m below to encircle an area (including lagoon) of {{convert|80|km²|0|abbr=on}}. Its [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (EEZ), {{convert|123700|km²|0|abbr=on}} in size, is [[Contiguity|contiguous]] with that of Europa Island.

The atoll consists of ten barren rocky islets, with no vegetation, totalling 0.2&amp;nbsp;km² (.077 sq mi) in area. Those on the north and east sides are 2.1 to 3&amp;nbsp;m high, while those on the west and south sides are 1.2&amp;nbsp;m high. The reef, whose coastline measures {{convert|35.2|km|0|abbr=on}}, is completely covered by the sea from three hours before [[Tide|high tide]] to three hours afterward. The region is also subject to [[cyclone]]s, making the atoll a long-time maritime hazard and the site of numerous shipwrecks.

[[Jaguar Seamount]] and [[Hall Tablemount]] lie, respectively, about 40 and 70&amp;nbsp;km further southwest.

== History ==

The Bassas da India was first recorded by [[Portuguese explorers]] in the early sixteenth century as the &quot;'''''Baixo da'' Judia'''&quot; (&quot;''Jewess'' Shoals&quot;). The ''Judia'' (&quot;''Jewess''&quot;, for the ancestry of its owner [[Fernão de Loronha]]&lt;ref&gt;Bernardo Gomes de Brito. ''Historia Tragico-Maritima. Em que se escrevem chronologicamente os Naufragios que tiverão as Naos de Portugal, depois que se poz em exercicio a Navegação da India.'' Lisboa 1735&lt;/ref&gt;) was the Portuguese ship that discovered the feature by running aground on it in 1506.&lt;ref&gt;Natal Museum. ''Natal Museum journal of humanities'', Vol. 12. The Museum Council (Pietermaritzburg), 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The name became &quot;'''Bassas da India'''&quot; due to transcription errors by cartographers. The ''Santiago'' broke up on the shoal in 1585.

It was rediscovered by the ''Europa'' in 1774, whence the name &quot;Europa Rocks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;...Europa [R]ocks, was {{sic}} discovered by the ship ''Europa'' in 1774.&quot; In ''Africa pilot, Part 3'' Hydrographic Office of Great Britain.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Malay'' was lost 27 July 1842 on the Europa Rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Historical Sketch of Salem, 1626-1879.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, the shoal became a [[Third French Republic|French]] possession, later being placed under the administration of a commissioner residing in [[Réunion]] in 1968. [[Madagascar]] continues to claim sovereignty over the islands.
