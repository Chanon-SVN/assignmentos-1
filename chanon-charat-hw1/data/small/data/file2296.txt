{{Book of Mormon}}
The '''Book of Mormon''' is a [[sacred text]] of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], which adherents believe contains writings of ancient [[prophet]]s who lived on the [[Americas|American continent]] from approximately 2200 BC to AD 421.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon B. Hinckley]], [http://speeches.byu.edu/reader/reader.php?id=6730 &quot;Praise to the Man&quot;], 1979-11-04.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Church Educational System]] (1996, rev. ed.). [http://www.ldsces.org/inst_manuals/bm-in-sm1996/manualindex.asp ''Book of Mormon Student Manual''] (Salt Lake City, Utah: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints), ch. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in March 1830 by [[Joseph Smith]] as ''The Book of Mormon: An Account Written by the Hand of Mormon upon Plates Taken from the Plates of Nephi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Smith|1830|loc=title page}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Smith's account and the book's narrative, the Book of Mormon was originally written in otherwise unknown characters referred to as &quot;[[reformed Egyptian]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mormon|morm|9|32}}&lt;/ref&gt; engraved on [[golden plates]]. Smith said that the last prophet to contribute to the book, a man named [[Moroni (Book of Mormon prophet)|Moroni]], buried it in a [[Hill Cumorah|hill]] in present-day [[New York]], then returned to earth in 1827 as an [[Angel Moroni|angel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Roberts|1902|pp=11, 18–19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; revealing the location of the book to Smith, and instructing him to translate it into English for use in the [[Restoration (Latter Day Saints)|restoration]] of Christ's true church in the [[End time#The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|latter days]]. Critics state that it was fabricated by Smith, drawing on material and ideas from modern works rather than translating an ancient record.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tanner Shadow&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brody&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Krakauer&quot;/&gt;

The Book of Mormon has a number of original and distinctive doctrinal discussions on subjects such as the [[fall of man|fall]] of [[Adam and Eve (LDS Church)|Adam and Eve]],&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{lds|2 Nephi|2_ne|2}}&lt;/ref&gt; the nature of the [[Atonement in Christianity|Atonement]],&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{lds|2 Nephi|2_ne|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[eschatology]], redemption from physical and spiritual death,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. {{lds|Alma|alma|12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the organization of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|latter-day church]]. The pivotal event of the book is an [[Resurrection appearances of Jesus#The Book of Mormon|appearance of Jesus Christ]] in the Americas shortly after his resurrection.

The Book of Mormon is the earliest of the [[Standard works|unique writings]] of the Latter Day Saint movement, the [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|denominations]] of which typically regard the text primarily as scripture, and secondarily as a historical record of God's dealings with the ancient inhabitants of the [[Americas]].&lt;ref name = bomintroduction/&gt; The Book of Mormon is divided into smaller books, titled after the individuals named as primary authors and, in most versions, divided into chapters and verses. It is written in English very similar to the [[Early Modern English]] linguistic style of the [[King James Version]] of the Bible, and has since been fully or partially translated into 108 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ash |first=Michael R. |url=http://www.mormonfortress.com/kjv2.html |title=The King James Bible and the Book of Mormon |work=Mormon Fortress |year=1997 |accessdate=2013-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, more than 150 million copies of the Book of Mormon have been published.&lt;ref name = 150million/&gt;

{{Main|Origin of the Book of Mormon|Golden plates|Criticism of the Book of Mormon}}
According to Joseph Smith, when he was seventeen &lt;!-- do not edit age, JS was 17 at time of Moroni visit, see refs for clarification --&gt;years of age an angel of God named [[Angel Moroni|Moroni]] appeared to him&lt;ref name=&quot;life-js&quot;&gt;[http://www.lds.org/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/the-life-and-ministry-of-joseph-smith &quot;The Life and Ministry of Joseph Smith&quot;], ''[[Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith]]'' (2007), xxii–25.&lt;/ref&gt; and said that a collection of ancient writings, engraved on [[golden plates]] by ancient prophets, was buried in a [[Cumorah|nearby hill]] in present-day [[Wayne County, New York]]. The writings were said to describe a people whom God had led from Jerusalem to the Western hemisphere 600 years before Jesus' birth. According to the narrative, Moroni was the last prophet among these people and had buried the record, which God had promised to bring forth in the latter days. Smith stated this vision occurred on the evening of September 21, 1823; and that on the following day, via divine guidance he located the burial location of the plates on this hill (called &quot;Cumorah&quot; by the angel); was instructed by Moroni to meet him at the same hill on September 22 of the following year to receive further instructions; and that in four years from this date the time would arrive for &quot;bringing them forth&quot;, i.e., translating them. Smith's description of these events recounts that he was allowed to take the plates on September 22, 1827, exactly four years from that date, and was directed to translate them into English.&lt;ref name=&quot;life-js&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|''Pearl of Great Price,'' [[Joseph Smith–History]]|js_h|1|59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounts of the way in which Smith dictated the Book of Mormon vary. Smith himself implied that he read the plates directly using spectacles prepared for the purpose of translating.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Other accounts variously state that he used one or more [[seer stones (Latter Day Saints)|seer stones]] placed in a top hat.&lt;ref name = ldstranslation/&gt; Both the special spectacles and the seer stone were at times referred to as the &quot;[[Urim and Thummim (Latter Day Saints)|Urim and Thummim]]&quot;.&lt;ref name = ldstranslation&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/topics/book-of-mormon-translation |contribution= Book of Mormon Translation |date= n.d. |work= LDS.org |publisher= LDS Church}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the translating process itself, Smith sometimes divided himself from his scribe with a blanket between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brodie|first=Fawn M.|title=No man knows my history: the life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet|year=1995|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0679730540|pages=53, 61|edition=2. ed., rev.and enl., 1. Vintage books ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the plates were not always present during the translating process, and when present, they were always covered up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brodie|first=Fawn M.|title=No man knows my history: the life of Joseph Smith, the Mormon prophet|year=1995|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York|isbn=0679730540|pages=42, 61|edition=2. ed., rev.and enl., 1. Vintage books ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith's first published description of the plates said the plates &quot;had the appearance of gold&quot;. They were described by [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]], one of Smith's early scribes, as &quot;fastened together in the shape of a book by wires.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Smith | first=Joseph, Jr. | author-link=Joseph Smith, Jr. | contribution=Wentworth Letter | title= Church History | place= [[Nauvoo, Illinois]] | journal=[[Times and Seasons]] | date=March 1, 1842 | volume=3 | issue=9 | pages=906–936 | url=http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v3n09.htm | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith called the engraved writing on the plates &quot;[[reformed Egyptian]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Only LDS linguists accept the existence of any language or character set known as &quot;reformed Egyptian&quot; as described in Mormon tradition. The only example of reformed Egyptian extant is the &quot;Caractors Document&quot;, also known as the &quot;[[Anthon Transcript]]&quot;, a paper written by Smith with examples of what he stated to be &quot;reformed Egyptian&quot; characters. See [[Reformed Egyptian]] for details and references.&lt;/ref&gt; A portion of the text on the plates was also &quot;[[Golden plates#&quot;Sealed&quot; portion|sealed]]&quot; according to his account, so its content was not included in the Book of Mormon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Smith|1842|p=707}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Smith's account regarding the plates, eleven others stated that they saw the golden plates and, in some cases, handled them. Their written testimonies are known as the Testimony of [[Three Witnesses]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/bm/thrwtnss &quot;Testimony of Three Witnesses&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; and the Testimony of [[Eight Witnesses]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/bm/eghtwtns &quot;Testimony of Eight Witnesses&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; These statements have been published in most editions of the Book of Mormon.

Smith enlisted the help of his neighbor, [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]], who later mortgaged his farm to underwrite the printing of the Book of Mormon, as a scribe during his initial work on the text. In 1828, Harris, prompted by his wife, [[Lucy Harris]], repeatedly requested that Smith lend him the current pages that had been translated. Smith reluctantly acceded to Harris's requests. Lucy Harris is thought to have stolen the [[Lost 116 pages|first 116 pages]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lucy Harris&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hitchens|2007|pp=163}}, {{Harvnb|Givens|2002|pp=33}}, {{Harvnb|Givens|2002|pp=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the loss, Smith recorded that he had lost the ability to translate, and that Moroni had taken back the plates to be returned only after Smith repented.&lt;ref&gt;[[Doctrine and Covenants]], [[s:The Doctrine and Covenants/Section 3|section 3]] and&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Brodie|1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Givens|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hitchens|2007|pp=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith later stated that God allowed him to resume translation, but directed that he begin translating another part of the plates. In 1829, with the assistance of [[Oliver Cowdery]], work on the Book of Mormon recommenced, and was completed in a short period (April–June 1829).&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling]] (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005), 70.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Smith said that he then returned the plates to Moroni upon the publication of the book.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/bm/jstestimony &quot;Testimony of Joseph Smith&quot;] {{Harvnb|Hitchens|2007|pp=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Book of Mormon went on sale at the bookstore of [[E.

For certain adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement, unresolved issues of the book's [[Historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon|historical authenticity]] and the lack of conclusive [[Archaeology and the Book of Mormon|archaeological]] evidence have led them to adopt a compromise position that the Book of Mormon may be the creation of Smith, but that it was nevertheless created through divine inspiration.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Grant H. Palmer. 2002. ''An Insider's View of Mormon Origins''. Salt Lake City, Signature Books; Brent Lee Metcalfe, ed. 1993. ''New Approaches to the Book of Mormon: Explorations in Critical Methodology''. Salt Lake City: Signature Books.&lt;/ref&gt; The position of most members of the Latter Day Saint movement and the official position of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) is that the book is an actual and accurate historical record.&lt;ref name = historicallyaccurate/&gt;

===Title===
Smith stated that the title page, and presumably the actual title of the 1830 edition, came from the translation of &quot;the very last leaf&quot; of the golden plates, and was written by the prophet-historian [[Moroni (Book of Mormon prophet)|Moroni]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Smith stated that the &quot;title page is not by any means a modern composition either of mine or of any other man's who has lived or does live in this generation.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Times and Seasons&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Smith |first=Joseph |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=October 1842 |title=Truth Will Prevail |journal=Times and Seasons |volume=III |issue=24 |page=943 |id= |url=http://www.centerplace.org/history/ts/v3n24.htm#943 |accessdate=2009-01-30 |quote= |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The title page states that the purpose of the Book of Mormon is &quot;to [show] unto the remnant of the house of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; ... and also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Book of Mormon [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/bm/ttlpg Title Page].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organization===
The Book of Mormon is organized as a compilation of smaller books, each named after its main named narrator or a prominent leader, beginning with the [[First Book of Nephi]] (1 Nephi) and ending with the [[Book of Moroni]].

The book's sequence is primarily chronological based on the narrative content of the book. Exceptions include the [[Words of Mormon]] and the [[Book of Ether]]. The Words of Mormon contains editorial commentary by [[Mormon (prophet)|Mormon]]. The Book of Ether is presented as the narrative of an earlier group of people who had come to America before the immigration described in 1 Nephi. First Nephi through [[Book of Omni|Omni]] are written in first-person narrative, as are Mormon and Moroni. The remainder of the Book of Mormon is written in third-person historical narrative, said to be compiled and abridged by Mormon (with Moroni abridging the Book of Ether).

Most modern editions of the book have been divided into chapters and verses. Most editions of the book also contain supplementary material, including the &quot;Testimony of [[Three Witnesses]]&quot; and the &quot;Testimony of [[Eight Witnesses]]&quot;.

===Chronology===
{{Main|Book of Mormon chronology}}
The books from [[Book of First Nephi|First Nephi]] to [[Book of Omni|Omni]] are described as being from &quot;the small plates of Nephi&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|''Book of Mormon,'' Words of Mormon|w_of_m|1|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This account begins in ancient [[Jerusalem]] around 600 BC. It tells the story of a man named [[Lehi (Book of Mormon prophet)|Lehi]], his family, and several others as they are led by God from Jerusalem shortly before the fall of that city to the [[Babylonians]] in 586 BC. The book describes their journey across the [[Arabian peninsula]], and then to the promised land, the Americas, by ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|1 Nephi|1_ne|18|23}}&lt;/ref&gt; These books recount the group's dealings from approximately 600 BC to about 130 BC, during which time the community grew and split into two main groups, which are called the [[Nephite]]s and the [[Lamanite]]s, that frequently warred with each other.

Following this section is the [[Words of Mormon]]. This small book, said to be written in AD 385 by [[Mormon (prophet)|Mormon]], is a short introduction to the books of [[Book of Mosiah|Mosiah]], [[Book of Alma|Alma]], [[Book of Helaman|Helaman]], [[Book of Third Nephi|Third Nephi]], and [[Book of Fourth Nephi|Fourth Nephi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brief-explanation&quot;&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/explanation &quot;A Brief Explanation about the Book of Mormon&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; These books are described as being abridged from a large quantity of existing records called &quot;the large plates of Nephi&quot; that detailed the people's history from the time of Omni to Mormon's own life. The [[Book of Third Nephi]] is of particular importance within the Book of Mormon because it contains an account of a visit by Jesus from heaven to the [[Americas]] sometime after his [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] and ascension. The text says that during this American visit, he repeated much of the same doctrine and instruction given in the [[Gospels]] of the Bible and he established an enlightened, peaceful society which endured for several generations, but which eventually broke into warring factions again.

The portion of the greater Book of Mormon called the [[Book of Mormon (Mormon's record)|Book of Mormon]] is an account of the events during Mormon's life. Mormon is said to have received the charge of taking care of the records that had been hidden, once he was old enough. The book includes an account of the wars, Mormon's leading of portions of the Nephite army, and his retrieving and caring for the records. Mormon is eventually killed after having handed down the records to his son Moroni.

According to the text, Moroni then made an abridgment (called the [[Book of Ether]]) of a record from a previous people called the [[Jaredites]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brief-explanation&quot;/&gt; The account describes a group of families led from the [[Tower of Babel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Ether|ether|1|3}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the Americas, headed by a man named [[Jared (Book of Mormon)|Jared]] and [[The Brother of Jared|his brother]]. The [[Jaredite]] civilization is presented as existing on the American continent beginning about 2500 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Joseph L. Allen, ''Sacred Sites: Searching for Book of Mormon Lands'' (2003) p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;—long before Lehi's family arrived shortly after 600 BC—and as being much larger and more developed.

The [[Book of Moroni]] then details the final destruction of the Nephites and the [[idolatry|idolatrous]] state of the remaining society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro &quot;Book of Moroni&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes significant doctrinal teachings and closes with Moroni's [[testimony]] and an invitation to [[prayer|pray]] to God for a confirmation of the truthfulness of the account.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Moroni|moro|10|4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Doctrinal and philosophical teachings===
[[File:The Hill Cumorah by C.C.A. Christensen.jpeg|325px|left|thumb|A depiction of [[Joseph Smith]]'s description of receiving the golden plates from the [[angel Moroni]] at the Hill Cumorah.]]
The Book of Mormon contains doctrinal and philosophical teachings on a wide range of topics, from basic themes of [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary J. Coleman]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/2002/01/the-book-of-mormon-a-guide-for-the-old-testament &quot;The Book of Mormon: A Guide for the Old Testament&quot;], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', January 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; to political and ideological teachings. Jesus is mentioned every 1.7 verses and is referred to by one hundred different names.&lt;ref&gt;[[Susan Ward Easton]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1978/07/discovery/names-of-christ-in-the-book-of-mormon &quot;Names of Christ in the Book of Mormon&quot;], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', July 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jesus====
Stated on the title page, the Book of Mormon's central purpose is for the &quot;convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Smith|1830|loc=Title Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book describes Jesus, prior to his birth, as a spirit &quot;without flesh and blood&quot;, although with a spirit &quot;body&quot; that looked similar to how Jesus would appear during his physical life.&lt;ref name=&quot;lds|Ether|ether|3|16&quot;&gt;{{lds|Ether|ether|3|16}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus is described as &quot;the Father and the Son&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Ether|ether|3|14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He is said to be: &quot;God himself [who] shall come down among the children of men, and shall redeem his people ... [b]eing the Father and the Son—the Father, because he was conceived by the power of God; and the Son, because of the flesh; thus becoming the Father and Son—and they are one God, yea, the very Eternal Father of heaven and of earth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|15|1|14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other parts of the book portray the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost as &quot;one.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|19|22|23}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, beliefs among the churches of the Latter Day Saint movement encompass [[nontrinitarian]]ism (in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]) to [[trinitarianism]] (particularly among the [[Community of Christ]]). See [[Godhead (Latter Day Saints)]].

In furtherance of its theme of reconciling Jews and Gentiles to Jesus, the book describes a variety of visions or visitations to some early inhabitants in the Americas involving Jesus. Most notable among these is a described visit of Jesus to a group of early inhabitants shortly after his [[resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|11}} to {{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the book's contributors described other visions of Jesus, including one by the [[Brother of Jared]] who, according to the book, lived before Jesus, and saw the &quot;body&quot; of Jesus' spirit thousands of years prior to his birth.&lt;ref name=&quot;lds|Ether|ether|3|16&quot;/&gt; According to the book, a [[Nephi, son of Lehi|narrator named Nephi]] described a vision of the birth, ministry, and death of Jesus,&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|1 Nephi|1_ne|11}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a prophecy of Jesus' name,&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|3|8}}&lt;/ref&gt; said to have taken place nearly 600 years prior to Jesus' birth.&lt;ref&gt;See {{lds|1 Nephi|1_ne|10|4}}, {{lds|1 Nephi|1_ne|19|8}}; See also {{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the narrative, at the time of [[King Benjamin]] (about 130 BC), the Nephite believers were called &quot;the children of Christ&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|5|7}}&lt;/ref&gt; At another place, the faithful members of the church at the time of [[Captain Moroni]] (73 BC) were called &quot;Christians&quot; by their enemies, because of their belief in Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|46|13|15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also states that for nearly 200 years after Jesus' appearance at the temple in the Americas&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|4 Nephi|1|22-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; the land was filled with peace and prosperity because of the people's obedience to his commandments.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|4 Nephi|4_ne|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the prophet [[Mormon (prophet)|Mormon]] worked to convince the faithless people of his time (AD 360) of Christ. Many other prophets in the book write of the reality of the Messiah, Jesus Christ.

In the Bible, Jesus spoke to the [[Jew]]s in [[Jerusalem]] of &quot;other sheep&quot; who would hear his voice.&lt;ref&gt;See {{lds|John|john|10|16}} in the [[King James Version]] of the Bible&lt;/ref&gt; The Book of Mormon claims this meant that the Nephites and other remnants of the [[Ten Lost Tribes|lost tribes]] of [[Israel]] throughout the world were to be visited by Jesus after his [[Death and Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|15|13|24}}, {{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|16|1|4}}, {{lds|2 Nephi|2_ne|29|7|14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other distinctive religious teachings====
On most religious issues, Book of Mormon doctrines are similar to those found in the Bible and among other Christian denominations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mormonstudies.net/html/ridenhour/baptist_bom.html  Protestant Doctrines within the Book of Mormon]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2014}} Among its somewhat distinctive theological interpretations are the following:{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}
* When the Old Testament prophet [[Isaiah]] wrote of voices that would &quot;whisper out of the dust,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah 29:4.&lt;/ref&gt; he was referring to the publication of the Book of Mormon.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|2 Nephi|2_ne|26|15|16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[fall of man]] is a prerequisite for procreation, and a necessary requirement for the return to God: &quot;Adam fell that men might be, and men are, that they might have joy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|2 Nephi|2_ne|2|25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The church should be named after Christ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.2-8#1 3 Nephi 27:2–8].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The atonement of Christ saves unbaptized people who die without a knowledge of the gospel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.25#24 2 Nephi 2:25].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.11-12#10 Mosiah 3:11–12].&lt;/ref&gt; including children who die without baptism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/8.11-16#10 Moroni 8:11–16].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Because of the [[death and resurrection of Jesus]], all humanity (&quot;both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, both the wicked and the righteous&quot;) will be resurrected with an immortal physical body sometime after their death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/11.42-45#41 Alma 11:42–45].&lt;/ref&gt;
* During Jesus' suffering the [[Garden of Gethsemane]] prior to his crucifixion, blood literally came from his every pore;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3.7#6 Mosiah 3:7].&lt;/ref&gt; the description of Jesus' sweat in Luke 22:44 is therefore not figurative.

====Teachings about political theology====
The book delves into [[political theology]] within a Christian or Jewish context. Among these themes are [[American exceptionalism]]. According to the book, the Americas are portrayed as a &quot;land of promise&quot;, the world's most exceptional land of the time.&lt;!--

On the issue of war and violence, the book teaches that war is justified for people to &quot;defend themselves against their enemies&quot;. However, they were never to &quot;give an offense,&quot; or to &quot;raise their sword ... except it were to preserve their lives.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|48|14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book praises the faith of [[Ammonites (Book of Mormon)|a group]] of former warriors who took an oath of complete [[pacifism]], refusing to take arms even to defend themselves and their people.&lt;ref name=&quot;lds|Alma|alma|24&quot;&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, 2,000 of their descendants, who had not taken the oath of their parents not to take up arms against their enemies, chose to go to battle against the Lamanites, and it states that in their battles the 2,000 men were protected by God through their faith and, though many were injured, none of them died.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|56|47-56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book recommends monarchy as an ideal form of government, but only when the monarch is righteous.&lt;ref name=&quot;lds|Alma|alma|24&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|29|13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book warns of the evil that occurs when the king is wicked, and therefore suggests that it is not generally good to have a king.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mosiah|mosial|29|18-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book further records the decision of the people to be ruled no longer by kings,&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mosiah|mosial|29}}&lt;/ref&gt; choosing instead a form of democracy led by elected judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Helaman|hel|6|17}}&lt;/ref&gt; When citizens referred to as &quot;king-men&quot; attempted to overthrow a democratically elected government and establish an unrighteous king, the book praises a military commander who executed pro-monarchy citizens who had vowed to destroy the church of God and were unwilling to defend their country from hostile invading forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|62|9|11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also speaks favorably of a particular instance of what appears to be a peaceful Christ-centered theocracy, which lasted approximately 194 years before contentions began again.&lt;ref name=&quot;lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|26|19&quot;&gt;{{lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|26|19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book supports notions of economic justice, achieved through voluntary donation of &quot;substance, every man according to that which he had, to the poor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|1|26|27}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In one case, all the citizens held their property in common.&lt;ref name=&quot;lds|3 Nephi|3_ne|26|19&quot;/&gt; When individuals within a society began to disdain and ignore the poor, to &quot;wear costly apparel&quot;, and otherwise engage in wickedness for personal gain, such societies are repeatedly portrayed in the book as being ripe for destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Jacob|jacob|2|13|13|14}}; {{lds|Alma|alma|4:6}}; {{lds|Alma|alma|5:53}}; {{lds|4 Nephi|4_ne|1|24}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious significance==

[[Joseph Smith]] characterized the Book of Mormon as the &quot;keystone&quot; of Mormonism, and claimed that it was &quot;the most correct of any book on earth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author= Joseph Smith |editor= [[B.

=== The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ===
The Book of Mormon is one of four sacred texts or [[standard works]] of the LDS Church.&lt;ref&gt;The other texts are the [[Bible]] ([[King James Version]]), the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]]: {{citation |last= Nelson |first= Russell M. |authorlink= Russell M.

Hinckley]] challenged each member of the church to re-read the Book of Mormon before the year's end.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon B. Hinckley]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/2005/08/a-testimony-vibrant-and-true &quot;A Testimony Vibrant and True&quot;], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'', August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The book's importance is commonly stressed at the twice-yearly [[General Conference (LDS Church)|general conference]], at special devotionals by [[General Authority|general authorities]], and in the church's teaching publications. Members are encouraged to read from the Book of Mormon daily.&lt;ref name = floodingtheearth/&gt;

The LDS Church encourages discovery of the book's truth by following the suggestion in its final chapter to study, ponder, and pray to God concerning its veracity. This passage is sometimes referred to as &quot;Moroni's Promise&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Moroni|moro|10|3|5}}; see {{citation |last= Cook |first= Gene R. |authorlink= Gene R.

As of April 2011, the LDS Church has published more than 150 million copies of the Book of Mormon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Mormon: 150 Million Copies|url=http://www.ldschurchnewsarchive.com/articles/60804/Book-of-Mormon-150-million-copies.html|publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community of Christ===
The [[Community of Christ]], formerly known as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, views the Book of Mormon as an additional witness of Jesus Christ and publishes two versions of the book through its official publishing arm, [[Herald House]]. The Authorized Edition is based on the original printer's manuscript and the 1837 Second Edition (or &quot;Kirtland Edition&quot;) of the Book of Mormon. Its content is similar to the Book of Mormon published by the LDS Church, but the versification is different. The Community of Christ also publishes a 1966 &quot;Revised Authorized Edition&quot;, which attempts to modernize some language.

In 2001, Community of Christ President [[W. Grant McMurray]] reflected on increasing questions about the Book of Mormon: &quot;The proper use of The Book of Mormon as sacred scripture has been under wide discussion in the 1970s and beyond, in part because of long-standing questions about its historical authenticity and in part because of perceived theological inadequacies, including matters of race and ethnicity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McMurray, W. Grant, [http://web.archive.org/web/20050218115333/http://www.cofchrist.org/docs/NativeAmericanConference/keynote.asp &quot;They 'Shall Blossom as the Rose': Native Americans and the Dream of Zion,&quot;] an address delivered February 17, 2001, cofchrist.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2007 Community of Christ World Conference, President [[Stephen M. Veazey]] ruled out-of-order a resolution to &quot;reaffirm the Book of Mormon as a divinely inspired record.&quot; He stated that &quot;while the Church affirms the Book of Mormon as scripture, and makes it available for study and use in various languages, we do not attempt to mandate the degree of belief or use. This position is in keeping with our longstanding tradition that belief in the Book of Mormon is not to be used as a test of fellowship or membership in the church.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew M. Shields, &quot;Official Minutes of Business Session, Wednesday March 28, 2007,&quot; in 2007 World Conference Thursday Bulletin, March 29, 2007. Community of Christ, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greater Latter Day Saint movement ===
There are a number of other [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|churches]] that are part of the Latter Day Saint movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson |first=B.A. |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/lds.htm |title=The LDS Restorationist movement, including The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints |publisher=Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance |work=ReligiousTolerance.org |date=June 8, 2010 |accessdate=2013-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these churches were created as a result of issues ranging from differing doctrinal interpretations and acceptance of the movement's scriptures, including the Book of Mormon, to disagreements as to who was the divinely chosen successor to Joseph Smith. These groups all have in common the acceptance of the Book of Mormon as scripture. It is this acceptance which distinguishes the churches of the Latter Day Saint movement from other Christian denominations. Separate editions of the Book of Mormon have been published by a number of churches in the Latter Day Saint movement, along with private individuals and foundations not endorsed by any specific denomination.

==Historical authenticity==
{{Main|Historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon}}
{{See also|Criticism of the Book of Mormon|Archaeology and the Book of Mormon|Genetics and the Book of Mormon|Linguistics and the Book of Mormon|Origin of the Book of Mormon|Book of Mormon anachronisms}}

The archaeological, historical and scientific communities are generally skeptical about the claims of the Book of Mormon. Critics of such tend to focus on four main areas:

* The lack of correlation between locations described in the Book of Mormon and American archaeological sites.&lt;ref&gt;Citing the lack of specific New World geographic locations to search, Michael D. Coe, a prominent Mesoamerican archaeologist and Professor Emeritus of Anthropology at Yale University, writes (in a 1973 volume of Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought): &quot;As far as I know there is not one professionally trained archaeologist, who is not a Mormon, who sees any scientific justification for believing [the historicity of The Book of Mormon], and I would like to state that there are quite a few Mormon archaeologists who join this group.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

* References to animals, plants, metals and technologies in the Book of Mormon that archaeological or scientific studies have found no evidence of in post-[[Pleistocene]], [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] America, frequently referred to as [[anachronisms]].&lt;ref&gt;Cecil H.

* The lack of linguistic connection between any [[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]] and [[Middle East#Languages|Near Eastern languages]].&lt;ref&gt;Lyle Campbell. 1979. &quot;Middle American languages,&quot; ''The Languages of Native America: Historical and Comparative Assessment''. Ed. Lyle Campbell and Marianne Mithun. Austin: University of Texas Press. Pages 902-1000.&lt;br /&gt;Lyle Campbell. 1997. ''American Indian Languages: The Historical Linguistics of Native America''. Oxford University Press.&lt;br /&gt;Jorge Súarez. 1983. ''The Mesoamerican Indian Languages''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Genetics and the Book of Mormon|lack of DNA evidence]] linking any [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American group]] to the ancient [[Ethnic groups in the Middle East|Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;The traditional view of the Book of Mormon suggests that Native Americans are principally the descendents of an Israelite migration around 600 BC. However, DNA evidence shows no Near Eastern component in the Native American genetic make-up. For example:&lt;br /&gt;Simon G. Southerton. 2004. ''Losing a Lost Tribe: Native Americans, DNA, and the Mormon Church''. Signature Books.&lt;br /&gt;The entire book is devoted to the specific topic of DNA evidence and the Book of Mormon.&quot; ...[T]he DNA lineages of Central America resemble those of other Native American tribes throughout the two continents. Over 99 percent of the lineages found among native groups from this region are clearly of Asian descent. Modern and ancient DNA samples tested from among the Maya generally fall into the major founding lineage classes... The Mayan Empire has been regarded by Mormons to be the closest to the people of the Book of Mormon because its people were literate and culturally sophisticated. However, leading New World anthropologists, including those specializing in the region, have found the Maya to be similarly related to Asians. Stephen L. Whittington...was not aware of any scientists 'in mainstream anthropology that are trying to prove a Hebrew origin of Native Americans... Archaeologists and physical anthropologists have not found any evidence of Hebrew origins for the people of North, South and Central America.'&quot; (pg 191)&lt;br /&gt;D. Andrew Merriwether. 2006. &quot;Mitochondrial DNA,&quot; ''Handbook of North American Indians''. Smithsonian Institution Press. Pg 817-830. &quot;Kolman, Sambuughin, and Bermingham (1995) and Merriwether et al. (1996) used the presence of A, B, C, and D to argue for Mongolia as the location for the source population of the New World founders. More specifically perhaps, they argued that the present-day Mongolians and present-day Native Americans are both derived from the same ancestral population in Asia, presumably in the Mongolia-Southern Siberia-Lake Baikal region. T.G. Schurr and S.G. Sherry (2004) strongly favor a southern Siberian origin for the majority of lineages found in the New World.&quot; (pg 829)&lt;br /&gt;Tatiana M. Karafet, Stephen L. Zegura, and Michael F. Hammer. 2006. &quot;Y Chromosomes,&quot; ''Handbook of North American Indians''. Smithsonian Institution. Pp. 831-839. &quot;Zegura et al. (2004) have presented the following scenario for the early peopling of the Americas based on Y chromosome data:  a migration of a single, polymorphic Asian population across Beringia with a potential common source for both North American founding lineages (Q and C) in the Altai Mountains of southwest Siberia. Since all their STR-based SNP lineage divergence dates between the Altai and North Asians versus Native Americans...ranged from 10,100 to 17,200 year ago, they favored a relatively late entry model.&quot; (pg. 839)&lt;br /&gt;Defenders of the book's historical authenticity suggest that the Book of Mormon does not disallow for other groups of people to have contributed to the genetic make-up of Native Americans.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Nevertheless, this is a departure from the traditional view that Israelites are the primary ancestors of Native Americans, and therefore would be expected to present some genetic evidence of Near Eastern origins. A recently announced change in the Book of Mormon's introduction, however, allows for a greater diversity of ancestry of Native Americans. See, for example, the following Deseret News article published on November 9, 2007: [http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,695226049,00.html Intro Change in Book of Mormon Spurs Discussion]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most adherents of the Latter Day Saint movement consider the Book of Mormon to generally be a historically accurate account.&lt;ref name = historicallyaccurate&gt;&quot;The limited success so far in swaying popular LDS opinion is a constant source of frustration for Mormon apologists...It appears that Mormons are generally content to picture the Book of Mormon story in a setting that is factually wrong. For most Mormons, the limited geography models create more problems than they solve. They run counter to the dominant literal interpretation of the text and contradict popular folklore as well as the clear pronouncements of all church presidents since the time of Joseph Smith&quot;, [[Simon G. Southerton]] (2004, Signature Books), ''Losing a Lost Tribe'', pp. 164-165.&lt;br&gt;&quot;Some of the [Community of Christ]'s senior leadership consider the Book of Mormon to be inspired historical fiction. For leaders of the Utah church, this is still out of the question. [The leadership], and most Mormons, believe that the historical authenticity of the Book of Mormon is what shores up Joseph Smith's prophetic calling and the divine authenticity of the Utah church&quot;, Southerton (2004), pg. 201.&lt;br&gt;Quotations from temple dedicatory sermons and prayers in Central and South America by President Gordon B. Hinckley in 1999-2000 continually refer to Native LDS members in attendance as &quot;children of Lehi&quot; (Southerton [2004], pp. 38-39).&lt;br&gt;&quot;Latter-Day Saints believe their scripture to be history, written by ancient prophets&quot;, Grant Hardy (2009, Yale University Press), &quot;Introduction,&quot; ''The Book of Mormon: The Earliest Text'', ed. Royal Skousen, pg. x.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the Latter Day Saint movement there are several [[Mormon apologetics|apologetic]] groups that seek to reconcile the discrepancies in diverse ways. Among these apologetic groups, much work has been published by [[FARMS|Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies]] (FARMS), and [[Foundation for Apologetic Information &amp; Research]] (FAIR), attempting to defend the Book of Mormon as a literal history, countering arguments critical of its historical authenticity, or reconciling historical and scientific evidence with the text. One of the more common recent arguments is the [[limited geography model]], which conjectures that the people of the Book of Mormon covered only a limited geographical region in either [[Mesoamerica]], [[South America]], or the [[Great Lakes]] area. The LDS Church has published material that suggests that science can support the Book of Mormon.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/2000/01/mounting-evidence-for-the-book-of-mormon |title= Mounting Evidence for the Book of Mormon |first= Daniel C. |last= Peterson |authorlink= Daniel C. Peterson |date=January 2000 |journal= Ensign }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manuscripts==
The Book of Mormon was dictated by Joseph Smith to several [[scribe]]s over a period of nearly two years, resulting in three [[manuscript]]s.

The 116-page manuscript contained the first 116 pages of the [[Book of Lehi]] and was lost after Smith lent the uncopied manuscript to [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lucy Harris&quot;/&gt;

The first completed manuscript, called the original manuscript, was completed using a variety of scribes. Portions of the original manuscript were also used for typesetting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;/&gt; In October 1841, the entire original manuscript was placed into the [[cornerstone]] of the [[Nauvoo House]], and sealed up until nearly forty years later when the cornerstone was reopened. It was then discovered that much of the original manuscript had been destroyed by water seepage and mold.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lightplanet&quot;/&gt; Surviving manuscript pages were handed out to various families and individuals in the 1880s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lightplanet&quot;/&gt; Only 28 percent of the original manuscript now survives, including a remarkable find of fragments from 58 pages in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;/&gt; The majority of what remains of the original manuscript is now kept in the LDS Church's Archives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;/&gt;

The second completed manuscript, called the printer's manuscript was a copy of the original manuscript produced by Oliver Cowdery and two other scribes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first = Royal | last = Skousen | title = Changes in the Book of Mormon | url = http://www.fairlds.org/FAIR_Conferences/2002_Changes_in_the_Book_of_Mormon.html | publisher =FAIR | location = 2002 FAIR Conference | format = Transcription of live presentation | accessdate = 2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is at this point that initial [[copyediting]] of the Book of Mormon was completed. Observations of the original manuscript show little evidence of corrections to the text.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lightplanet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Skousen |first=Royal Skousen |url=http://www.lightplanet.com/mormons/book_of_mormon/manuscripts.html |title=Book of Mormon Manuscripts |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company |year=1992 |accessdate=2013-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LindsayFAQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jefflindsay.com/LDSFAQ/FQ_changes.shtml#printed |title=LDS FAQ: Changes in the Book of Mormon |publisher=JeffLindsay.com |date=November 27, 2012 |accessdate=2013-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The printer's manuscript is now the earliest surviving complete copy of the Book of Mormon, being nearly 100 percent extant;&lt;ref&gt;There are three lines missing from the printer's manuscript in its current condition, covering 1 Nephi 1:7–8, 20. http://mi.byu.edu/publications/jbms/?vol=15&amp;num=1&amp;id=401&lt;/ref&gt; it is owned by the [[Community of Christ]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;/&gt;

Critical comparisons between surviving portions of the manuscripts show an average of two to three changes per page from the original manuscript to the printer's manuscript, with most changes being corrections of scribal errors such as misspellings or the correction, or standardization, of grammar inconsequential to the meaning of the text.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LindsayFAQ&quot;/&gt; The printer's manuscript was further edited, adding paragraphing and punctuation to the first third of the text.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;/&gt;

The printer's manuscript was not used fully in the [[typesetting]] of the 1830 version of Book of Mormon; portions of the original manuscript were also used for typesetting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;/&gt; The original manuscript was used by Smith to further correct errors printed in the 1830 and 1837 versions of the Book of Mormon for the 1840 printing of the book.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;/&gt;

==Editions==

=== Chapter and verse notation systems ===
The original 1830 publication did not have verse markers, though the individual books were divided into relatively long chapters. Just as the Bible's present chapter and verse notation system is a later addition of Bible publishers to books that were originally solid blocks of undivided text, the chapter and verse markers within the books of the Book of Mormon are conventions, not part of the original text.

Publishers from different factions of the Latter Day Saint movement have published different chapter and verse notation systems. The two most significant are the LDS system, introduced in 1879, and the RLDS system, which is based on the original 1830 chapter divisions.&lt;ref&gt;The Zarahemla Research Foundation publishes a 48-page booklet titled &quot;Book of Mormon Chapter &amp; Verse: RLDS–LDS Conversion Table&quot; to enable readers of an LDS edition to find references from an RLDS edition and vice versa.&lt;/ref&gt;

The RLDS 1908 edition, RLDS 1966 edition, the [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]] edition, and Restored Covenant editions use the RLDS system while most other current editions use the LDS system.

===Textual criticism===

In 1989, scholars at [[Brigham Young University]] began work on a critical text edition of the Book of Mormon. Volumes 1 and 2, published in 2001, contain transcriptions of all the text variants of the English editions of the Book of Mormon, from the original manuscript to the newest editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Skousen|May 2001}};{{Harvnb|Skousen|January 2001}};{{Harvnb|Skousen|March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volume 4, which is being published in parts, is a critical analysis of all the text variants. Volume 3, which is not yet published, will describe the history of all the English-language texts from Joseph Smith to today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Skousen|2004}};{{Harvnb|Skousen|2005}};{{Harvnb|Skousen|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences between the original and printer's manuscript, the 1830 printed version, and modern versions of the Book of Mormon have led some critics to claim that evidence has been systematically removed that could have proven that Smith fabricated the Book of Mormon, or are attempts to hide embarrassing aspects of the church's past.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brody&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Krakauer&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Skousen&quot;/&gt;

=== Non-English translations ===
[[File:Book of Mormon translations.jpg|130px|right|thumb|Translations of the Book of Mormon.]]
{{See also|List of Book of Mormon translations}}
The LDS version of the Book of Mormon has been translated into 83 languages and selections have been translated into an additional 25 languages. In 2001, the LDS Church reported that all or part of the Book of Mormon was available in the native language of 99 percent of [[Latter-day Saints]] and 87 percent of the world's total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/2001/07/taking-the-scriptures-to-the-world |title= Taking the Scriptures to the World |journal= Ensign |date=July 2001 |page= 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Translations into languages without a tradition of writing (e.g., Kakchiqel, [[Tzotzil language|Tzotzil]]) are available on audio cassette.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldscatalog.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StoreCatalogDisplay?storeId=10151&amp;catalogId=10151&amp;langId=-1 Welcome&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translations into [[American Sign Language]] are available on videocassette and DVD.

Typically, translators are members of the LDS Church who are employed by the church and translate the text from the original English. Each manuscript is reviewed several times before it is approved and published.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/2005/02/news-of-the-church |contribution= Translation Work Taking Book of Mormon to More People in More Tongues |title= News of the Church |journal= Ensign |date=February 2005 |pages= 75–76 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the LDS Church stopped translating selections from the Book of Mormon, and instead announced that each new translation it approves will be a full edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/2005/02/news-of-the-church |contribution= Translation Work Taking Book of Mormon to More People in More Tongues |title= News of the Church |date=February 2005 |journal= Ensign}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representations in media==
[[File:HCP Nephi's Vision.PNG|thumb|right|300px|A scene from the Book of Mormon being depicted in the [[Hill Cumorah Pageant]]]]
Events of the Book of Mormon are the focus of several [[List of films of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS Church films]], including ''[[The Life of Nephi]]'' (1915), ''[[How Rare a Possession]]'' (1987) and ''[[The Testaments of One Fold and One Shepherd]]'' (2000). Such films in [[LDS cinema]] (i.e., films not officially commissioned by the LDS Church) include ''[[The Book of Mormon Movie, Vol. 1: The Journey]]'' (2003) and ''[[Passage to Zarahemla]]'' (2007).

In 2003, a ''[[South Park]]'' episode titled &quot;[[All About Mormons]]&quot; parodied the origins of the Book of Mormon.

In 2011, a [[religious satire]] [[musical theatre|musical]] titled ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]'' premiered on [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]].

[[Second Book of Nephi|Second Nephi]] [http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/9.20-27#19 9:20–27] from the Book of Mormon is quoted in a funeral service in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s film ''[[Family Plot]]''.

== Distribution ==
The LDS Church, which distributes free copies of the Book of Mormon, reported in 2011 that 150 million copies of the book have been printed since its initial publication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ldschurchnewsarchive.com/articles/60797/150-Million-and-Counting-The-Book-of-Mormon-reaches-another-milestone.html &quot;150 Million and Counting: The Book of Mormon reaches another milestone&quot;], ''[[Church News]]'', 2011-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial printing of the Book of Mormon in 1830 produced 5000 copies.&lt;ref name = 150million&gt;[http://www.lds.org/church/news/book-of-mormon-reaches-150-million-copies &quot;Book of Mormon Reaches 150 Million Copies&quot;], lds.org, 2011-04-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The 50 millionth copy was printed in 1990, with the 100 millionth following in 2000 and reaching 150 million in 2011.&lt;ref name =150million/&gt;
