The '''Mexican tetra''' or '''blind cave fish''' (''Astyanax mexicanus'')  is a [[freshwater]] [[fish]]
of the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Characidae]] of the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Characiformes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fishbase&quot;&gt;{{FishBase species

The [[type species]] of its [[genus]], it is native to the [[Nearctic]] [[ecozone]], originating in the lower [[Rio Grande]] and the [[Nueces River|Neueces]] and [[Pecos River]]s in [[Texas]], as well as the central and eastern parts of Mexico.

Growing to a maximum overall length of 12&amp;nbsp;cm (4.7&amp;nbsp;in), the Mexican tetra is of typical characin shape, with unremarkable, drab coloration.  Its blind cave form, however, is notable for having no eyes and being [[albino]], that is, completely devoid of pigmentation; it has a pinkish-white color to its body.

This fish, especially the blind variant, is reasonably popular among [[wikt:aquarists|aquarists]].

''A. mexicanus'' is a peaceful species that spends most of its time in midlevel water above the rocky and sandy bottoms of pools and backwaters of creeks and rivers of its native environment.  Coming from a [[subtropical]] climate, it prefers water with 6.0&amp;ndash;7.8 [[pH]], a [[Hard water|hardness]] of up to 30 [[dGH]], and a temperature range of 20 to 25°C (68 to 77°F). In the winter, it migrates to warmer waters.  Its natural diet consists of [[crustacean]]s, [[insect]]s, and [[annelid]]s, although in captivity it is [[omnivorous]].

The Mexican tetra has been treated as a subspecies of ''[[Astayanax faciatus|A. fasciatus]],'', but this is not widely accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;fishbase&quot; /&gt;
==Blind cave form==
[[Image:Mexican Tetra as Blind Cave Fish.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Mexican tetra in blind cave fish form]]
''A. mexicanus'' is famous for its blind [[cave]] form, which is known by such names as '''blind cave tetra''', '''blind tetra''', and '''blind cavefish'''. These forms have lost their [[visual perception|sight]] and even their [[eye]]s. These fish can still, however, find their way around by means of their [[lateral line]]s, which are highly sensitive to fluctuating [[water pressure]].&lt;ref name=&quot;yoshizawa&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yoshizawa|first=M.|coauthors=Yamamoto, Y.

''[[Astyanax jordani]]'', another blind cave fish, is sometimes confused with the cave form of ''A. mexicanus.''
===Evolution research===
The surface and cave forms of the Mexican tetra have proven powerful subjects for scientists studying [[evolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;retaux&quot; /&gt; When the surface-dwelling ancestors of current cave populations entered the subterranean environment, the change in ecological conditions rendered their [[phenotype]]—which included many biological functions dependent on the presence of light—subject to [[natural selection]] and [[genetic drift]].&lt;ref name=&quot;soares&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wilkens&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilkens|first=H|title=Genes, modules and the evolution of cave fish|journal=Heredity|date=Nov 2012|volume=105|issue=5|pages=413–422|doi=10.1038/hdy.2009.184}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most striking changes to evolve was the loss of eyes. This is referred to as a &quot;regressive trait&quot; because the surface fish that originally colonized caves possessed eyes.&lt;ref name=&quot;retaux&quot; /&gt; In addition to regressive traits, cave forms evolved &quot;constructive traits&quot;. In contrast to regressive traits, the purpose or benefit of constructive traits is generally accepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;soares&quot; /&gt; Active research focuses on the mechanisms driving the evolution of regressive traits, such as the loss of eyes, in ''A. mexicanus''. Recent studies have produced evidence that the mechanism may be direct selection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Protas|first=M|coauthors=Tabansky, I. Conrad, M. Gross, J. B. Vidal, O. Tabin, C. J. Borowsky, R.|title=Multi-trait evolution in a cave fish, Astyanax mexicanus|journal=Evolution &amp; Development|date=Mar–Apr 2008|volume=10|issue=2|pages=196–209|doi=10.1111/j.1525-142x.2008.00227.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; or indirect selection through antagonistic pleiotropy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jeffery|first=WR|title=Regressive Evolution in Astyanax Cavefish|journal=Annual Review of Genetics|year=2009|volume=43|pages=25–47|doi=10.1146/annurev-genet-102108-134216}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than genetic drift and neutral mutation, the traditionally favored hypothesis for regressive evolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;wilkens&quot; /&gt;

The blind form of the Mexican tetra is different from the surface-dwelling form in a number of ways, including having unpigmented skin, having a better [[olfaction|olfactory]] sense by having [[taste bud]]s all over its head, and by being able to store four times more energy as fat, allowing it to deal with irregular food supplies more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Helfman G., Collette B., &amp; Facey D.: The Diversity of Fishes, Blackwell Publishing, p 315, 1997, ISBN 0-86542-256-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin said of sightless fish:{{Quote|By the time that an animal had reached, after numberless generations, the deepest recesses, disuse will on this view have more or less perfectly obliterated its eyes, and natural selection will often have affected other changes, such as an increase in the length of antennae or palpi, as compensation for blindness.|Charles Darwin|Origin of Species (1859)}}

Modern genetics has made clear that the lack of use does not, in itself, necessitate a feature's disappearance. [http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1134/is_5_114/ai_n13811128] In this context, the positive genetic benefits have to be considered, i.e., what advantages are obtained by cave-dwelling tetras by losing their eyes? Possible explanations include:
*Not developing eyes allows the individual more energy for growth and reproduction.[http://www.daylightatheism.org/2006/02/evolved-minds.html]
*There remains less chance of accidental damage and infection, since the previously useless and exposed organ is sealed with a flap of protective skin.
*The lack of eyes disables the body clock, which is controlled by periods of light and dark, conserving energy.

Another likely explanation for the loss of its eyes is that of selective neutrality and genetic drift; in the dark environment of the cave, the eyes are neither advantageous nor disadvantageous and thus any genetic factors that might impair the eyes (or their development) can take hold with no consequence on the individual or species. Because there is no selection pressure for sight in this environment, any number of genetic abnormalities that give rise to the damage or loss of eyes could proliferate among the population with no effect on the fitness of the population.

Among some [[creation-evolution controversy|creationists]], the cave tetra is seen as evidence 'against' evolution. One argument claims this is an instance of &quot;[[Biological devolution|devolution]]&quot;—showing an evolutionary trend of decreasing complexity. But evolution is a nondirectional process, and while increased complexity is a common effect, there is no reason why evolution cannot tend towards simplicity if that makes an organism better suited to its environment.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, R.: Climbing Mount Improbable, W. W. Norton &amp; Co, 1997, ISBN 0-393-31682-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Research by MIT biology professor Susan Lindquist shows that inhibition of the HSP90 protein has a dramatic effect in the development of the blind tetra.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencemag.org/content/342/6164/1372.full&lt;/ref&gt; This research is seen by creationists as evidence of &quot;built-in adaptability, not slow and gradual evolution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.icr.org/article/7871/&lt;/ref&gt;
===In the aquarium===
The blind cave tetra is a fairly hardy species. Their lack of sight does not hinder their ability to get food. They prefer subdued lighting with a rocky substrate, like gravel, mimicking their natural environment. They become semi-aggressive as they age, and are by nature schooling fish.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}
