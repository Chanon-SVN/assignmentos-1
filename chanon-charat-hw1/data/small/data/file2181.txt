BMW was established as a business [[entity]] following a restructuring of the [[Rapp Motorenwerke]] [[aircraft]] manufacturing firm in 1917. After the end of [[World War I]] in 1918, BMW was forced to cease aircraft-engine production by the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles Armistice Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pilotenschule.ch/geschichte.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528021613/http://www.pilotenschule.ch/geschichte.htm |archivedate=28 May 2007 |title= Fliegerschule St.Gallen&amp;nbsp;– history|accessdate=24 August 2008 |language=German }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company consequently shifted to motorcycle production in 1923, once the restrictions of the treaty started to be lifted,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=8XEV3HRlBZ4C|title=BMW Motorcycles|author=Darwin Holmstrom, Brian J.

The first car which BMW successfully produced and the car which launched BMW on the road to automobile production was the [[BMW Dixi|Dixi]], it was based on the [[Austin 7]] and licensed from the [[Austin Motor Company]] in Birmingham, England.

BMW's first significant aircraft engine (and commercial product of any sort) was the [[BMW IIIa]] inline-six liquid-cooled engine of 1918, much preferred for its high-altitude performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?id=A19710908000 |title=BMW Model IIIA – Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum |publisher=Nasm.si.edu |accessdate=18 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100408190510/http://nasm.si.edu/collections/artifact.cfm?id=A19710908000| archivedate= 8 April 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; With German rearmament in the 1930s, the company again began producing aircraft engines for the [[Luftwaffe]]. Among its successful World War II engine designs were the [[BMW 132]] and [[BMW 801]] air-cooled [[radial engines]], and the pioneering [[BMW 003]] [[axial compressor|axial-flow]] [[turbojet]], which powered the tiny, 1944–1945–era jet-powered &quot;emergency fighter&quot;, the [[Heinkel He 162]] ''Spatz''. The BMW 003 jet engine was first tested as a prime powerplant in the first prototype of the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]], the Me 262 V1, but in 1942 tests the BMW prototype engines failed on takeoff with only the standby [[Junkers Jumo 210]] mose-mounted piston engine powering it to a safe landing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=dSLBdP22fq0C&amp;pg=PA31 |title=The Jet Race and the Second World War |first=Sterling Michael |last=Pavelec |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year= 2007 |isbn=978-0-275-99355-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Radinger |first=Will |first2= Walter |last2=Schick. |title=Me262 (in German) |location=Berlin |publisher=Avantic Verlag GmbH |year=1996 |isbn=978-3-925505-21-8 |page=23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The few Me 262 A-1b test examples built used the more developed version of the 003 jet, recording an official top speed of 800 km/h (497 mph).  The first-ever four-jet aircraft ever flown, the sixth and eighth prototypes of the [[Arado Ar 234#Ar 234A|Arado Ar 234]] jet reconnaissance-bomber, used BMW 003 jets for power.  The improving reliability of the 003 as 1944 progressed, earmarked it as the required powerplant for airframe designs competing for the [[Emergency Fighter Program|''Jägernotprogramm'']]'s [[light fighter]] production contract, won by the [[Heinkel He 162]] ''Spatz'' design.  Towards the end of the Third Reich BMW developed some military aircraft projects for the ''Luftwaffe'', the [[BMW Strahlbomber]], the [[BMW Schnellbomber]] and the [[BMW Strahljäger]], but none of them were built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nevingtonwarmuseum.weebly.com/bmw-strahljager-project-i.html |title=BMW Strahljager Project I |publisher=Nevingtonwarmuseum.weebly.com |date=3 November 1944 |accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dan Johnson |url=http://www.luft46.com/bmw/bmw.html |title=BMW Aircraft |publisher=Luft46.com |date= |accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the year 1958, the automotive division of BMW was in financial difficulties and a shareholders meeting was held to decide whether to go into liquidation or find a way of carrying on. It was decided to carry on and to try to cash in on the current economy car boom enjoyed so successfully by some of Germany's ex-aircraft manufacturers such as [[Messerschmitt]] and [[Heinkel]]. The rights to manufacture the Italian [[Isetta|Iso Isetta]] were bought; the tiny cars themselves were to be powered by a modified form of BMW's own motorcycle engine. This was moderately successful and helped the company get back on its feet. The controlling majority shareholder of the BMW [[Stock corporation|Aktiengesellschaft]] since 1959 is the Quandt family, which owns about 46% of the stock. The rest is in [[public float]].

BMW acquired the [[Hans Glas]] company based in [[Dingolfing]], Germany, in 1966. Glas vehicles were briefly badged as BMW until the company was fully absorbed. It was reputed that the acquisition was mainly to gain access to Glas' development of the timing belt with an overhead camshaft in automotive applications,&lt;ref&gt;Toronto Star 3 July 2004&lt;/ref&gt; although some saw Glas' Dingolfing plant as another incentive. However, this factory was outmoded and BMW's biggest immediate gain was, according to themselves, a stock of highly qualified engineers and other personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;AU71&quot;&gt;{{citation | ref = AU71 | journal = Auto-Universum 1971 | title = BMW 2500/2800 | last = Becker | first = Clauspeter | editor-first = Arthur | editor-last = Logoz | year = 1971 | publisher = Verlag Internationale Automobil-Parade AG | location = Zürich, Switzerland | volume = XIV | page = 73 | language = German }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Glas factories continued to build a limited number of their existing models, while adding the manufacture of BMW front and rear axles until they could be closer incorporated into BMW.&lt;ref name=&quot;AU71.4&quot;&gt;[[#AU71|Becker]], p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BMW 328i F30 2012 vl 2.jpg|thumb|BMW 3-Series (F30)]]
In 1992, BMW acquired a large stake in California based [[industrial design]] studio [[DesignworksUSA]], which they fully acquired in 1995. In 1994, BMW bought the British [[Rover Group]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=KdbY5QkQ64cC |title=Corporate Cultures And Global Brands |author=Albrecht Rothacher |year=2004 |publisher=World Scientific |isbn=978-981-238-856-8 |page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which at the time consisted of the [[Rover (car)|Rover]], [[Land Rover]] and [[MG (car)|MG]] brands as well as the rights to defunct brands including [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] and [[Morris Motors|Morris]]), and owned it for six years. By 2000, Rover was incurring huge losses and BMW decided to sell the combine. The MG and Rover brands were sold to the Phoenix Consortium to form [[MG Rover]], while Land Rover was taken over by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. BMW, meanwhile, retained the rights to build the new [[BMW Mini|Mini]], which was launched in 2001.

Chief designer [[Chris Bangle]] announced his departure from BMW in February 2009, after serving on the design team for nearly seventeen years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/autos/autobeat/archives/2009/02/bmws_chris_bangle_designs_his_own_exit.html|title= Chris Bangle|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by [[Adrian van Hooydonk]], Bangle's former right-hand man. Bangle was known for his radical designs such as the 2002 7-Series and the 2002 Z4. In July 2007, the production rights for [[Husqvarna Motorcycles]] was purchased by BMW for a reported 93 million euros. [[BMW Motorrad]] plans to continue operating Husqvarna Motorcycles as a separate enterprise. All development, sales and production activities, as well as the current workforce, have remained in place at its present location at Varese.

In June 2012, BMW was listed as the #1 most reputable company in the world by Forbes.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Jacquelyn|title=The World's Most Reputable Companies|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2012/06/07/the-worlds-most-reputable-companies/|publisher=Forbes.com|accessdate=7 June 2012|date=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rankings are based upon aspects such as &quot;people's willingness to buy, recommend, work for, and invest in a company is driven 60% by their perceptions of the company and only 40% by their perceptions of their products.&quot;

In 2006, the BMW group (including Mini and Rolls-Royce) produced 1,366,838 four-wheeled vehicles, which were manufactured in five countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oica.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/bmw.pdf |title=World Motor Vehicle Production, OICA correspondents survey 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, it manufactured 1,481,253 four-wheeled vehicles and 112,271 motorcycles (under both the BMW and Husqvarna brands).&lt;ref name=&quot;AR2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://annual-report.bmwgroup.com/2010/gb/files/pdf/en/BMW_Group_AR2010.pdf |format=PDF |title=Annual Report 2010 |accessdate=16 March 2011 |publisher=BMW Group}}{{dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BMW X3 (E83) was made by Magna Steyr, a subsidiary of Magna of Canada, in Graz, Austria under license from BMW until 2010. More than 45,973 were produced in 2009.
Starting October 2010, the new BMW X3 (F25) is produced at [[BMW US Manufacturing Company]], Greer, Spartanburg County, South Carolina.

It is reported that about 56% of BMW-brand vehicles produced are powered by petrol engines and the remaining 44% are powered by diesel engines. Of those petrol vehicles, about 27% are four-cylinder models and about nine percent are eight-cylinder models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/blogs/autocarconfidential/archive/2011/02/18/the-future-of-bmw-s-engines.aspx |title=The future of BMW's engines |date=11 February 2011 |author=Hilton Holloway |publisher=Autocar }}&lt;/ref&gt; BMW also has local assembly operation using complete [[Knock-down kit|knock down components]] in Thailand, Russia, Egypt, Indonesia, Malaysia, and India, for 3, 5, 7 series and X3.&lt;ref name=&quot;bmwgroup1&quot;/&gt;

[[File:R32-pn.jpg|thumb|The [[BMW R32|R32]] [[motorcycle]], the first BMW [[motor vehicle|motor vehicle.]]]]
BMW began production of motorcycle engines and then motorcycles after World War I.&lt;ref name=&quot;artof&quot;&gt;Peter Gantriis, Henry Von Wartenberg. &quot;The Art of BMW: 85 Years of Motorcycling Excellence&quot;. MotorBooks International, September 2008, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Its motorcycle brand is now known as [[BMW Motorrad]]. Their first successful motorcycle, after the failed Helios and Flink, was the &quot;[[BMW R32|R32]]&quot; in 1923. This had a &quot;[[Flat-twin engine|boxer]]&quot; twin engine, in which a cylinder projects into the air-flow from each side of the machine. Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMWs are still produced in this layout, which is designated the [[History of BMW motorcycles#R series|R Series]].

During the Second World War, BMW produced the [[BMW R75]] motorcycle with a [[sidecar]] attached. Having a unique design copied from the [[Zündapp]] KS750, its sidecar wheel was also motor-driven. Combined with a lockable [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], this made the vehicle very capable off-road, an equivalent in many ways to the [[Willys MB|Jeep]].

In 1982, came the [[BMW K1200S|K Series]], shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven [[History of BMW motorcycles#F series|F]] and [[History of BMW motorcycles#G series|G]] series with single and parallel twin [[Rotax]] engines.

In the early 1990s, BMW updated the [[airhead (motorcycle)|airhead]] Boxer engine which became known as the [[oilhead]]. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to 1,170&amp;nbsp;cc and enhanced performance to {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} for the [[BMW R1200GS|R1200GS]], compared to {{convert|85|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} of the previous [[BMW R1150GS|R1150GS]]. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing {{convert|98|and|122|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, respectively.

In 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing {{convert|167|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.

[[File:BMW S1000 RR Studio.JPG|thumb|left|[[BMW S1000RR]]]]
BMW introduced [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles pave the way for the introduction of [[electronic stability control]], or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.

BMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an [[Earles fork]], front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called [[swinging arm]]).
Some BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.

BMW Group, on 31 January 2013 announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought Husqvarna for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.

===New Class===
{{Main|BMW New Class}}

The ''New Class'' (German: ''Neue Klasse'') was a line of compact [[sedan (car)|sedans]] and coupes starting with the 1962 1500 and continuing through the last 2002s in 1977. Powered by BMW's celebrated [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]] [[BMW M10|M10]] engine, the New Class models had a fully [[independent suspension]], [[MacPherson strut]]s in front, and front disc brakes. Initially a family of four-door sedans and two-door coupes, the New Class line was broadened to two-door sports sedans with the addition of the ''02 Series'' 1600 and 2002 in 1966.

Sharing little in common with the rest of the line beyond power train, the sporty siblings caught auto enthusiasts' attention and established BMW as an international brand. Precursors to the famed BMW [[3 Series]], the two-doors' success cemented the firm's future as an upper tier performance car maker. New Class four-doors with numbers ending in &quot;0&quot; were replaced by the larger [[BMW 5 Series]] in 1972. The upscale 2000C and 2000CS coupes were replaced by the [[Straight-6|six-cylinder]] [[BMW E9]], introduced in 1969 with the 2800CS. The 1600 two-door was discontinued in 1975, and the 2002 was replaced by the 320i in 1975.

In 2012, BMW was named the world's most sustainable automotive company for the eighth consecutive year by the Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes. The BMW Group is the only automotive enterprise in the index since its inception in 1999. In 2001, the BMW Group committed itself to the United Nations Environment Programme, the UN Global Compact and the Cleaner Production Declaration. It was also the first company in the automotive industry to appoint an environmental officer, in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/pressDetail.html?title=bmw-group-once-again-sector-leader-in-dow-jones-sustainability-index&amp;outputChannelId=6&amp;id=T0131942EN&amp;left_menu_item=node__805&lt;/ref&gt; BMW is a member of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wbcsd.org/about/members/members-list-region.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

BMW is industry leader in the Carbon Disclosure Project's Global 500 ranking and 3rd place in Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index across all industries.
BMW is listed in the FTSE4GoodIndex.
The BMW Group was rated the most sutainable DAX 30 company by Sustainalytics in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bmwgroup.com/bmwgroup_prod/e/0_0_www_bmwgroup_com/verantwortung/svr_2012/nachhaltiges_wirtschaften.html&lt;/ref&gt;

BMW has taken measures to reduce the impact the company has on the environment. It is trying to design less-polluting cars by making existing models more efficient, as well as developing environmentally friendly fuels for future vehicles. Possibilities include: electric power, hybrid power (combustion engines and electric motors) hydrogen engines.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, J and Walker, M: &quot;BMW A Sustainable Future? &quot;, page 11. Wild World 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

BMW offers 49 models with EU5/6 emissions norm and nearly 20 models with CO2 output less than 140 g/km, which puts it on the lowest tax group and therefore could provide the future owner with eco-bonus offered from some European countries.

However, there have been some criticisms directed at BMW, and in particular, accusations of [[greenwash]] in reference to their BMW Hydrogen 7. Some critics claim that the emissions produced during [[hydrogen fuel]] production outweigh the reduction of tailpipe emissions, and that the Hydrogen 7 is a distraction from more immediate, practical solutions for car pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christian Wüst |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,448648,00.html |title=BMW's Hydrogen 7: Not as Green as it Seems - SPIEGEL ONLINE |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=17 November 2006 |accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BMW E71 X6 xDrive35i 01.JPG|thumb|BMW X6 (E71)]]
BMW vehicles follow a certain [[nomenclature]]; usually a 3 digit number is followed by 1 or 2 letters. The first number represents the series number. The next two numbers traditionally represent the [[engine displacement]] in cubic centimeters divided by 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Interone Worldwide GmbH |url=http://www.bmw.ca |title=BMW Canada – The Ultimate Driving Experience |publisher=Bmw.ca |date= |accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more recent cars use those two numbers as a performance index, as e.g. the 116i, 118i and 120i (all 2,0L gas-powered), just like the 325d and 330d (both 3,0L diesel) share the same motor block while adjusting engine power through setup and turbocharging. A [[History of BMW motorcycles#Model designation|similar nomenclature]] is used by [[BMW Motorrad]] for their motorcycles.

The system of letters can be used in combination, and is as follows:
* A = [[automatic transmission]]
* C = [[coupé]], last used on the [[BMW E46]] and the [[BMW E63]] (dropped after 2005 model year)
* c = [[Convertible (car)|cabriolet]]
* d = [[diesel engine|diesel]]&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;
* e = [[BMW M20|eta]] (efficient economy, from the [[eta|Greek letter 'η']])
* g = [[compressed natural gas|compressed natural gas/CNG]]
* h = [[hydrogen]]
* i = [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]]
* L = [[wheelbase|long wheelbase]]
* s = sport, also means &quot;2 dr&quot; on E36 model&lt;sup&gt;††&lt;/sup&gt;
* sDrive = [[rear-wheel drive]]
* T = [[station wagon|touring (wagon/estate)]]
* Ti = [[hatchback]] for the [[BMW Compact|BMW 3 Series hatchback]]
* x / xDrive = [[BMW xDrive]] [[all-wheel drive]]

&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt; historic nomenclature indicating &quot;td&quot; refers to &quot;Turbo Diesel&quot;, not a diesel hatchback or touring model (524td, 525td)

&lt;sup&gt;††&lt;/sup&gt; typically includes sport seats, spoiler, aerodynamic body kit, upgraded wheels and Limit Slip Differential on pre-95 model etc.

For example, the BMW 750iL is a fuel-injected 7 Series with a long wheelbase and 5.4&amp;nbsp;litres of displacement. This badge was used for successive generations, E65 and F01, except the &quot;i&quot; and &quot;L&quot; switched places, so it read &quot;Li&quot; instead of &quot;iL&quot;.

When 'L' supersedes the series number (e.g. L6, L7, etc.) it identifies the vehicle as a special luxury variant, having extended leather and special interior appointments. The L7 is based on the E23 and E38, and the L6 is based on the E24.

When 'X' is capitalised and supersedes the series number (e.g. X3, X5, etc.) it identifies the vehicle as one of BMW's Sports Activity Vehicles (SAV), their brand of [[Crossover (automobile)|crossovers]], with [[BMW xDrive|BMW's xDrive]]. The second number in the 'X' series denotes the platform that it is based upon, for instance the X5 is derived from the 5 Series. Unlike BMW cars, the SAV's main badge does not denote engine size; the engine is instead indicated on side badges.

The 'Z' identifies the vehicle as a two-seat roadster (e.g. Z1, Z3, Z4, etc.). 'M' variants of 'Z' models have the 'M' as a suffix or prefix, depending on country of sale (e.g. 'Z4 M' is 'M Roadster' in Canada).

Previous X &amp; Z vehicles had 'i' or 'si' following the engine displacement number (denoted in litres). BMW is now globally standardising this nomenclature on X &amp; Z vehicles by using 'sDrive' or 'xDrive' (simply meaning rear or all-wheel drive, respectively) followed by two numbers which vaguely represent the vehicle's engine (e.g. Z4 sDrive35i is a rear-wheel-drive Z4 roadster with a 3.0&amp;nbsp;L twin-turbo fuel-injected engine).&lt;ref&gt;FAQ from the BMW Z4 Press Conference, as reported by BMWBLOG, 8 May 2009. http://www.bmwblog.com/2009/05/08/faq-from-the-recent-bmw-press-conference&lt;/ref&gt;

BMW last used the 's' for the E36 328is, which ceased production in 1999. However, the 's' nomenclature was brought back on the 2011 model year BMW 335is and BMW Z4 sDrive35is. The 335is is a sport-tuned trim with more performance and an optional [[dual clutch transmission]] that slots between the regular 335i and top-of-the-line [[BMW M3|M3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/posteddriving/archive/2010/01/25/preview-2011-160-bmw-335is-coupe.aspx |title=Preview: 2011 BMW 335is Coupe – Posted Driving |publisher=Network.nationalpost.com |accessdate=28 August 2010}}{{dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cunningham |first=Wayne |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/2300-10863_7-10004093.html |title=2011 BMW 335is (photos) – CNET Reviews |publisher=Reviews.cnet.com |date=13 July 2010 |accessdate=28 August 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100827174943/http://reviews.cnet.com/2300-10863_7-10004093.html?| archivedate= 27 August 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'M' – for [[BMW M|Motorsport]] – identifies the vehicle as a high-performance model of a particular series (e.g. M3, M5, M6, etc.). For example, the M6 is the highest performing vehicle in the 6 Series lineup. Although 'M' cars should be separated into their respective series platforms, it is very common to see 'M' cars grouped together as its own lineup on the official BMW website.

===Exceptions===
There are exceptions to the numbering nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mrbimmer.com/bmw.information&lt;/ref&gt;

The M version of the [[BMW 1 Series]] was named the [[BMW 1 Series M Coupe]] rather than the traditional style &quot;M1&quot; due to the possible confusion with BMW's former [[BMW M1]] homologation sports car.

The M versions of the Sports Activity Vehicles, such as the [[BMW X5 M|X5 M]], could not follow the regular naming convention since MX5 was used for [[Mazda]]'s [[Mazda MX-5|MX-5 Miata]].

For instance in the 2008 model year, the BMW 125i/128i, 328i, and 528i all had 3.0 naturally aspirated engines ([[BMW N52|N52]]), not a 2,500&amp;nbsp;cc or 2,800&amp;nbsp;cc engine as the series designation number would lead one to believe. The '28' is to denote a detuned engine in the 2008 cars, compared to the 2006 model year '30' vehicles (330i and 530i) whose 3.0 naturally aspirated engines are from the same N52 family but had more output.

The 2008 BMW 335i and 535i also have 3.0-litre engine; however the engines are [[turbocharger|twin-turbocharged]] ([[BMW N54|N54]]) which is not identified by the nomenclature. Nonetheless the '35' indicates a more powerful engine than previous '30' models that have the [[BMW N52|naturally aspirated N52 engine]]. The 2011 BMW 740i and 335is shares the same twin-turbo 3.0 engine from the N54 family but tuned to higher outputs, although the badging is not consistent ('40' and 's'). The 2013 BMW 640i Gran Coupe's twin-scroll single turbo 3.0L inline-6 engine makes similar output to the older twin turbo inline-6 engines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automobilemag.com/reviews/driven/1205_2013_bmw_640i_gran_coupe/ |title=First Drive: 2013 BMW 640i Gran Coupe - Automobile Magazine |publisher=Automobilemag.com |date= |accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The E36 and E46 323i and E39 523i had 2.5-litre engines. The E36 318i made after 1996 has a 1.9&amp;nbsp;L engine ([[BMW M44|M44]]) as opposed to the 1.8&amp;nbsp;L ([[BMW M42|M42]]) used in the 1992 to 1995 models. The E39 540i had a 4.4&amp;nbsp;L [[BMW M62|M62]] engine, instead of a 4.0&amp;nbsp;L as the designation would suggest.

The badging for recent V8 engines ([[BMW N62|N62]] and [[BMW N63|N63]]) also does not indicate displacement, as the 2006 750i and 2009 750i have 4800&amp;nbsp;cc (naturally aspirated) and 4400&amp;nbsp;cc (twin-turbocharged) engines, respectively.

==Carsharing services==
In June 2011, BMW and Sixt launched [[Drivenow]], a joint-venture that provides carsharing services in several cities in Europe and North America. As of December 2012, DriveNow operates over 1,000 vehicles, which serve five cities worldwide and over 60,000 customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electricdrive.org/index.php?ht=d/ReleaseDetails/id/33626 |title=BMW Group takes top prize at the 2012 Corporate Entrepreneur Awards for premium car-sharing joint venture DriveNow.

==Light and Charge==
BMW has developed [[street light]]s equipped with sockets to charge [[electric car]]s, called [[Light and Charge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/07/us-bmw-lighting-sockets-idUSKBN0IR14Q20141107?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=technologyNews BMW develops street lights with electric car-charging sockets]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the summer of 2001 until October 2005, BMW hosted [[The Hire]], showcasing sporty models being driven to extremes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bmwfilms.com|title=BMW Films |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927185229/http://www.bmwfilms.com/ |archivedate=27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; These videos are still popular within the enthusiast community and proved to be a ground-breaking online advertising campaign.

Annually since 1999, BMW enthusiasts have met in Santa Barbara, CA to attend [[Bimmerfest]]. One of the largest brand-specific gatherings in the U.S., over 3,000 people attended in 2006, and over 1,000 BMW cars were present. In 2007, the event was held on 5 May.

===BMW slang===
The initials BMW are pronounced {{IPA-de|ˈbeː ˈɛm ˈveː|}} in German.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://books.google.com/?id=qOAYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |title=A short German grammar for high schools and colleges|first=Edward |last=Stevens Sheldon |publisher=Heath |year=1891 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The model series are referred to as &quot;Einser&quot; (&quot;One-er&quot; for 1 series), &quot;Dreier&quot; (&quot;Three-er&quot; for 3 series), &quot;Fünfer&quot; (&quot;Five-er&quot; for the 5 series), &quot;Sechser&quot; (&quot;Six-er&quot; for the 6 series), &quot;Siebener&quot; (&quot;Seven-er&quot; for the 7 series).

===The arts===

Manufacturers employ [[Industrial design|designer]]s for their cars, but BMW has made efforts to gain recognition for exceptional contributions to and support of the arts, including art beyond motor vehicle design. These efforts typically overlap or complement BMW's marketing and branding campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=BMW Commissions Artists for Auto Werke Art Project |periodical=Art Business News| year= 2000 |volume=27 |issue=13 |page=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BMW Headquarters]] designed in 1972 by Karl Schwanzer has become a European icon,&lt;ref name=Patton2009/&gt; and artist [[Gerhard Richter]] created his ''Red, Yellow, Blue'' series of paintings for the building's lobby.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=&lt;!-- http://www.stoutbooks.com/cgi-bin/stoutbooks.cgi/76418.html --&gt; |last1=Friedel |first1= Helmut |first2= Robert|last2= Storr  |title=Gerhard Richter: Red – Yellow – Blue |publisher=Prestel |isbn=978-3-7913-3860-6 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Action Painting, motorized |first= Christopher |last=Shea |date=27 March 2009 |url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/brainiac/2009/03/action_painting.html | newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, [[Alexander Calder]] was commissioned to paint the [[BMW 3.0CSL|3.0CSL]] driven by Hervé Poulain at the 24 Hours of Le Mans.

===April Fools===
BMW has garnered a reputation over the years for its [[April Fools' Day|April Fools]] pranks, which are printed in the British press every year. In 2010, they ran an advert announcing that customers would be able to order BMWs with different coloured badges to show their affiliation with the political party they supported.

Construction of the plant started in January 2006 with an initial investment of more than one billion Indian Rupees. The plant started operation in the first quarter of 2007 and produces the different variants of [[BMW 3 Series]], [[BMW 5 Series]], [[BMW 7 Series]], [[BMW X1]], [[BMW X3]], [[Mini Cooper S]], [[Mini Cooper D]] and [[Mini Countryman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Interone Worldwide GmbH |url=http://www.bmw.in/in/en/index_narrowband.html |title=International BMW website |publisher=Bmw.in |date=11 December 2006 |accessdate=11 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090417153657/http://www.bmw.in/in/en/index_narrowband.html| archivedate= 17 April 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014 BMW announced it was establishing a plant in Mexico, in the city and state of [[San Luis Potosi]] involving an investment of $1 billion. Taking advantage of lower wages in the country, and the terms of free trade agreements Mexico has with a host of other countries, were the motivating factors the company said.

===South Africa===
BMWs have been assembled in South Africa since 1968,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmw.co.za/products/automobiles/bmw_insights/history.asp|publisher=BMW South Africa|title=Corporate Information: History}}&lt;/ref&gt; when Praetor Monteerders' plant was opened in [[Rosslyn, Gauteng|Rosslyn]], near [[Pretoria]]. BMW initially bought shares in the company, before fully acquiring it in 1975; in so doing, the company became '''BMW South Africa''', the first wholly owned subsidiary of BMW to be established outside Germany. Three unique models that [[BMW Motorsport]] created for the South African market were the [[BMW E23|E23]] M745i (1983), which used the [[BMW M88|M88]] engine from the [[BMW M1]], the BMW 333i (1986), which added a six-cylinder 3.2-litre [[BMW M30|M30]] engine to the [[BMW E30|E30]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmwplant.co.za/Content/frame_content.jsp@content=http-3a-2f-2fhaf0gau02~5.htm |title=BMW South Africa – Plant Rosslyn |publisher=Bmwplant.co.za |accessdate=11 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[BMW 3 Series (E30)|E30]] BMW 325is (1989) which was powered by an [[Alpina]]-derived 2.7-litre engine.

Unlike U.S. manufacturers, such as [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors|GM]], which divested from the country in the 1980s, BMW retained full ownership of its operations in South Africa. Following the end of [[apartheid]] in 1994, and the lowering of import tariffs, BMW South Africa ended local production of the 5-Series and 7-Series, in order to concentrate on production of the 3-Series for the export market. South African–built BMWs are now exported to [[right hand drive]] markets including Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Hong Kong, as well as [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Since 1997, BMW South Africa has produced vehicles in [[left-hand drive]] for export to [[Taiwan]], the United States and [[Iran]], as well as South America.

BMWs with a [[Vehicle Identification Number|VIN]] starting with &quot;NC0&quot; are manufactured in South Africa.

The [[BMW US Manufacturing Company|BMW Manufacturing Company]] opened in 1994 and has been manufacturing all [[BMW Z4|Z4]] and [[BMW X5|X5]] models, and more recently the [[BMW X6|X6]] and [[BMW X3 (F25)|X3]], including those for export to Europe, on the same assembly line in [[Greer, South Carolina|Greer]] near [[Spartanburg, South Carolina|Spartanburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.worldcarfans.com/10609256128/last-of-first-generation-bmw-x5-manufactured |title=Out with the old, in with the new|publisher=BMW AG|date=16 October 2006|accessdate=4 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an average work day the company builds 600 vehicles: 500 X5s and 100 Z4s. The engines for these vehicles are built in Munich, Germany. BMWs with a [[Vehicle Identification Number|VIN]] starting with &quot;4US and 5US&quot; are manufactured at Spartanburg.

In 2010 BMW announced that it would spend $750&amp;nbsp;million to expand operations at the Greer plant. This expansion will allow production of 240,000 vehicles a year and will make the plant the largest car factory in the United States by number of employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bennett|first=Jeff|title=BMW to Expand Plant in South Carolina|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=14 October 2010|page=B5}}&lt;/ref&gt; BMW's largest single market is the United States.

Currently, the facility produces all BMW X3, X5 and X6 models. The X4, which will be launched in 2014, will also be produced in Spartanburg.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Marketing==

BMW began using the slogan 'The Ultimate Driving Machine' in the 1970s. In 2010, this long-lived campaign was mostly supplanted by 'Joy', a campaign intended to make the brand more &quot;approachable&quot; and to better appeal to women, but by 2012 they had returned to &quot;The Ultimate Driving Machine&quot;, which has a strong public association with BMW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/jimhenry/2012/05/31/bmw-still-the-ultimate-driving-machine-not-that-it-ever-wasnt/ |title=BMW Still the Ultimate Driving Machine  |publisher=Forbes.com |date=31 May 2012 |accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audio logo===
In 2013, BMW replaced the 'double-gong' sound used in TV and Radio advertising campaigns since 1998. The new sound, developed to represent the future identity of BMW, was described as &quot;introduced by a rising, resonant sound and underscored by two distinctive bass tones that form the sound logo's melodic and rhythmic basis.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sofia Johansson|url=http://www.psfk.com/2013/03/bmw-sound-logo.html |title=BMW Updates Their Iconic Sound Logo |publisher=PSFK |date=22 March 2013 |accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new sound was first used in BMW 4 Series Concept Coupe TV commercial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoevolution.com/bmw-blog/bmw-introduces-new-sound-logo-video-56578.html |title=BMW Introduces New Sound Logo |publisher=Autoevolution.com |date=19 March 2013 |accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound was produced by Thomas Kisser of HASTINGS media music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motortorque.com/car-news/new-sound-logo-for-bmw-revealed-21692.aspx |title=New sound logo for BMW revealed |publisher=Motortorque.com |date=19 March 2013 |accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roundel logo===
[[File:BMW Logo on White Car.jpg|thumb|The round BMW logo used for all models]]
The circular blue and white BMW logo or [[Roundel#Corporate use|roundel]] evolved from the circular [[Rapp Motorenwerke]] company logo, from which the BMW company grew, combined with the blue and white colors of the [[flag of Bavaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znBnNJ1Fv08 |title=The origin of the BMW logo |accessdate=29 December 2011|author=BMW }}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo has been portrayed as the movement of an aircraft propeller with the white blades cutting through a blue sky—first used in a BMW advertisement in 1929, twelve years after the roundel was created—but this is not the origin of the logo itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/bmw-roundel-not-born-from-planes/ |title=BMW Roundel: Not Born From Planes |accessdate=29 December 2011|author=Stephen Williams |work=The New York Times |date=7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theft using OBD==
In 2012, BMW vehicles were stolen by programming a blank key fob to start the car through the [[on-board diagnostics]] (OBD) connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2169857/Alarming-moment-thieves-silently-steal-BMW-programming-blank-key-cost-just-70.html|title=Alarming moment thieves silently steal BMW by programming a blank key that cost just £70 in new crime trend sweeping Britain|date=6 July 2012|accessdate=23 August 2012|publisher=Daily Mail|first=James|last=Titcomb|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pistonheads report into thefts via obd|url=http://pistonheads.com/news/default.asp?storyId=25953|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jalopnik.com/5923802/watch-hackers-steal-a-bmw-in-three-minutes|title=Watch Hackers Steal A BMW In Three Minutes|first=Jason|last=Torchinsky|date=6 July 2012|accessdate=28 August 2012|publisher=Jalopnik}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary causes of this vulnerability lie in the lack of appropriate [[authentication]] and [[authorization]] in the OBD specifications, which rely largely on [[security through obscurity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|url=https://isc.sans.edu/presentations/sansfire2012-Rob_Vandenbrink-obd-preso.pdf|format=PDF|title=Dude, Your Car is Pwnd|first=Rob|last=Van den Brink|publisher=[[SANS Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Litigation==

===Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft -v- BMW Properties Ltd===
On 30 March 2009, BMW wrote to the respondent saying that the latter were using the acronym BMW in their name and were therefore in breach of their [[Registered trademark symbol|registered UK and EC trademarks]]. On 27 April 2009, the respondent replied saying they were in the process of changing their name; BMW Properties Ltd did nothing about this and so BMW wrote again on 26 November 2009.

Nothing happened by 1 March 2010 and so BMW instructed their lawyers to write to the respondent company giving them until 5 March 2010 to change their name arguing they were committing the [[Passing off|tort of passing off]].

On 15 March 2010, BMW applied under s.69(1)(b) [[Companies Act 2006]] for a change in name of BMW Properties Ltd which had been registered since 30 March 2010.

The respondent changed its name on 30 April 2010 to GRLC Ltd and so BMW informed the [[Company Names Tribunal]] that they would not be proceeding against the respondent, save as to costs.
