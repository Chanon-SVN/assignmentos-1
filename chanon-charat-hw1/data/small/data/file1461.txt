According to ancient sources including [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Aristotle]], in 467 BC a large [[meteorite]] landed near Aegospotami. He described it as brown in colour and the size of a wagon load; it was a local landmark for more than 500 years. A comet, tentatively identified as [[Halley's Comet]], was reported at the time the meteorite landed. This is possibly the first European record of Halley's comet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Comets: A Chronological History of Observation, Science, Myth and Folklore |author=Donald K.
