'''''Batman Returns''''' is a 1992 [[United States|American]] [[superhero film]], directed and produced by [[Tim Burton]], based upon the [[Batman]] character appearing in magazines published by [[DC Comics]]. It is the second installment of [[Warner Bros.]]' [[Batman in film#Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher series (1989-1997)|initial ''Batman'' film series]], with [[Michael Keaton]] reprising the title role of Bruce Wayne/Batman. The film introduces the characters of Max Shreck ([[Christopher Walken]]), a business tycoon who teams up with the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] ([[Danny DeVito]]) to take over [[Gotham City]], as well as the character of [[Catwoman]] ([[Michelle Pfeiffer]]).

Burton originally did not want to direct another Batman film because of his mixed emotions toward the [[Batman (1989 film)|previous film]] in 1989. Warner Bros. developed a script with writer Sam Hamm which had the Penguin and Catwoman going after hidden treasure. Burton agreed to return after he granted him more creative control and replaced Hamm with [[Daniel Waters (screenwriter)|Daniel Waters]]. [[Wesley Strick]] did an uncredited rewrite, removing the characters of [[Harvey Dent]] and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] and rewriting the climax.  [[Annette Bening]] was originally cast as Catwoman but was replaced with Pfeiffer following her pregnancy. Filming for ''Batman Returns'' started in in June 1991 at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California.

''Batman Returns'' was released on June 19, 1992. The film was nominated for [[Academy Award]]s for [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]] and [[Academy Award for Best Makeup|Best Makeup]], as well as two [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] awards. ''Batman Returns''{{'}}s budget was an estimated $80 million, grossing $266,822,354 worldwide but Warner Bros. was disappointed as it was still substantially less than the first film. Burton was asked to restrict himself to the role of producer for ''[[Batman Forever]]'', which led to Keaton vacating the role of Batman.

==Plot==
Tucker and Esther Cobblepot, an aristocratic couple, throw their deformed infant child in a river, feeling that [[Gotham City]]'s high society would not approve after witnessing their son kill their pet cat. However, a flock of penguins living in an abandoned zoo artic world connected to the sewers rescue him and raise him. 33 years later, the child becomes the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] and kidnaps businessman Max Shreck, blackmailing him into helping him become a citizen of Gotham using evidence of his corporate crimes. 

Meanwhile, Max discovers that his secretary, [[Selina Kyle]], has learnt of his plan to build a power plant which will drain Gotham of its electricity. Max pushes her out of a window to her death, and a flock of alley cats lick her corpse, reviving her. She returns home, suffers a [[mental breakdown]] and designs a black vinyl catsuit, becoming the costumed vigilante [[Catwoman]].

Penguin sends one of his costumed henchmen to kidnap the mayor's baby while he &quot;saves&quot; him, becoming a hero to the people of Gotham. However, billionaire [[Bruce Wayne]] is suspicious of the Penguin and discovers that he is the leader of the Red Triangle Circus Gang who commits crimes throughout Gotham. As [[Batman]], Bruce decides to protect Gotham from the gang. After Penguin discovers that his parents are dead and his name is Oswald Cobblepot, Max decides to make Penguin the mayor of Gotham because the current mayor will not approve of Max's power plant. To do this, the Penguin has the Red Triangle Circus Gang create a riot, causing the citizens to lose all faith in the mayor, but Batman stops it. During the riot, Catwoman vandalizes Max's Department Store to gain revenge on him. When Batman and Penguin confront each other, she intervenes before the store blows up. Penguin escapes as Catwoman fights Batman, who pushes her off a rooftop, but a litter box on a truck saves her.

The next day, Penguin and Catwoman collaborate on a plan to kill Batman. Meanwhile, Bruce and Selina develop a romantic relationship. Penguin and Catwoman kidnap the Ice Princess, an actress chosen to turn on the Gotham City Christmas Tree Lights, framing Batman. Batman finds her but Catwoman takes her to a rooftop where the Penguin releases a swarm of flying bats which make the Princess retreat backwards, falling off, making her death seem like Batman's fault. Catwoman rejects the Penguin's advances, prompting him to try killing her. Batman enters the Batmobile and discovers that Penguin has control over it, due to a device Penguin's gang installed. The Penguin takes it on a devastating rampage, but Batman regains control over it, escaping death.

Batman, having recorded the Penguin's demeaning attitude of Gotham's people during the rampage, plays it during the Penguin's election speech, turning the people against him. Enraged, Penguin kidnaps all the first-born sons of Gotham, and Max Shreck. Batman saves all the babies, forcing the Penguin to execute an alternate plan to destroy the entire city with his penguin army. However, Batman foils the plan by luring the penguins back to the Penguin's sewer base. He briefly battles the Penguin, then pushes him into sewer water. Catwoman tries to kill Max, but Batman stops her and reveals himself as Bruce. Max shoots at Batman, knocking him out. 

Catwoman claims that she has six of her nine lives left, although Max shoots her four times, leaving her with two lives. Catwoman kisses Max with an electrical taser between their lips and breaks an electric wire, creating an explosion which kills Max but Batman cannot find Selina's corpse. The Penguin emerges from the water, but chokes on his own blood from internal injuries from the fall and falls to the ground, dead. His emperor penguins hold a funeral for their former boss and drag his corpse into the sewer water, his resting place.

Afterwards, [[Alfred Pennyworth|Alfred]] drives Bruce home. Suddenly, Bruce spots Selina's shadow in an alley. He investigates the area, only finding her black cat Miss Kitty, taking her with him before exchanging Christmas wishes with Alfred. The [[Batsignal]] lights up in the night sky and Catwoman rises up into the foreground and stares at it, confirming that she is alive.

==Production==

===Development===
After the success of ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', [[Warner Bros.]] was hoping for a sequel to start filming in May 1990 at [[Pinewood Studios]]. They spent $250,000 storing the sets from the first film. [[Tim Burton]] had mixed emotions about directing another film in the franchise after his experiences with the previous film. &quot;I will return if the sequel offers something new and exciting&quot;, he said in 1989. &quot;Otherwise it's a most-dumbfounded idea.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Jones (November 1989). &quot;Batman in Production&quot;, ''[[Cinefantastique]]'', pp. 75—88. Retrieved August 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Burton decided to direct ''[[Edward Scissorhands]]'' for [[20th Century Fox]]. Meanwhile, [[Sam Hamm]] from the previous film delivered the first two drafts of the script, while [[Bob Kane]] was brought back as a creative consultant.&lt;ref name=cinema&gt;[[Tim Burton]], [[Sam Hamm]], [[Denise Di Novi]], [[Daniel Waters (screenwriter)|Daniel Waters]], ''Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight—The Dark Side of the Knight'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt; Hamm's script had [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] and [[Catwoman]] going after hidden treasure.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt;

Burton was impressed with [[Daniel Waters (screenwriter)|Daniel Waters]]' work on ''[[Heathers]]''; Burton originally brought Waters aboard on a sequel to ''[[Beetlejuice]]''. Warner Bros. then granted Burton a large amount of creative control, demoting producers [[Jon Peters]] and [[Peter Guber]] to executive producers. Dissatisfied with the Hamm script, Burton commissioned a rewrite from Waters.&lt;ref name=cinema/&gt;&lt;ref name=beetle&gt;Judy Sloane (August 1995). &quot;Daniel Waters on Writing&quot;, ''Film Review'', pp. 67—69. Retrieved August 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=forever/&gt; Waters &quot;came up with a social satire that had an evil mogul backing a bid for the Mayor's office by the Penguin&quot;, Waters reported. &quot;I wanted to show that the true villains of our world don't necessarily wear costumes.&quot;&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt; The subplot of Penguin running for Mayor came from [[Batman (TV series)|the 1960s TV series]] episodes &quot;Hizzoner the Penguin&quot; and &quot;Dizzoner the Penguin&quot;.&lt;ref name=Mad&gt;Jeffrey Resner (August 1992). &quot;Three Go Mad in Gotham&quot;, ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'', pp. 39—46. Retrieved August 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Waters wrote a total of five drafts.&lt;ref name=forever&gt;{{cite book | author= Ken Hanke | title = Tim Burton: An Unauthorized Biography of the Filmmaker | publisher =[[Renaissance Books]] | year =1999 | pages =117–122 | isbn = 1-58063-162-2 | chapter = Batman on Burton's Terms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the characterization of Catwoman, Waters explained &quot;Sam Hamm went back to the way comic books in general treat women, like fetishy sexual fantasy. I wanted to start off just at the lowest point in society, a very beaten down secretary.&quot;&lt;ref name=beetle/&gt; [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]] appeared in early drafts of the script, but was deleted. His disfiguring appearance of Two-Face would have appeared in the climax when Catwoman kisses him with a taser to the face, which was replaced with Max Shreck. Waters quoted, &quot;Sam Hamm definitely planned that. I flirted with it, having Harvey start to come back and have one scene of him where he flips a coin and it's the good side of the coin, deciding not to do anything, so you had to wait for the next movie.&quot;&lt;ref name=beetle/&gt; In early scripts Max Shreck was the &quot;golden boy&quot; of the Cobblepot family, whereas Penguin was the deformed outsider. It turned out that Shreck would be the Penguin's long-lost brother.&lt;ref name=villain&gt;[[Daniel Waters (screenwriter)|Daniel Waters]], [[Alex Ross]], ''Batman Returns: Villains'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt; Max Shreck was also a reference to actor [[Max Schreck]], known for his role as [[Count Orlok]] in ''[[Nosferatu]]''.&lt;ref name=forever/&gt;

===Pre-production===
Burton hired [[Wesley Strick]] to do an uncredited rewrite. Strick recalled, &quot;When I was hired to write ''Batman Returns'' (''Batman II'' at the time), the big problem of the script was Penguin's lack of a 'master plan'.&quot;&lt;ref name=stick&gt;{{cite book | author=David Hughes | title =Comic Book Movies | publisher =[[Virgin Books]] | year =2003 | pages =33–46 | isbn = 0-7535-0767-6| chapter = Batman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner Bros. presented Strick with warming, or freezing [[Gotham City]], a plot point they would later use in ''[[Batman &amp; Robin (film)|Batman &amp; Robin]]''. Strick gained inspiration from a [[Moses]] parallel that had Penguin killing the firstborn sons of Gotham. A similar notion was used when the Penguin's parents threw him into a river as a baby.&lt;ref name=stick/&gt; [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] appeared in the script, but was deleted because Waters felt the film had too many characters. Waters called Robin &quot;the most worthless character in the world, especially with [Batman as] the loner of loners.&quot; Robin started out as a juvenile gang leader, who becomes an ally to Batman. Robin was later changed to a black teenage garage mechanic.&lt;ref name=beetle/&gt; Waters explained, &quot;He's wearing this old-fashioned garage mechanic uniform and it has an 'R' on it. He drives the [[Batmobile]], which I notice they used in the [[Batman Forever|third film]]!&quot;&lt;ref name=beetle/&gt; [[Marlon Wayans]] was cast, and signed for a sequel. The actor had attended a wardrobe fitting, but it was decided to save the character for a third installment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Nathan Rabin | url = http://www.avclub.com/content/node/23240 | title = Wayans world | work = [[The A.V.

[[Michael Keaton]] returned after a significant increase in his salary at $10 million. [[Annette Bening]] was cast as [[Catwoman]] after Burton saw her performance in ''[[The Grifters (film)|The Grifters]]'', but she dropped out due to pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,308195,00.html | title = 'Batman 3' |work=Entertainment Weekly | date = October 1, 1993 | accessdate =August 16, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080921055255/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,308195,00.html| archivedate= September 21, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Raquel Welch]], [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Ellen Barkin]], [[Cher]], [[Bridget Fonda]] and [[Susan Sarandon]] were then in competition for the role.&lt;ref name=cinema/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,315097,00.html | title = Big-Game Hunting |work=Entertainment Weekly | date = August 9, 1991 | accessdate =August 14, 2008 | first1=Pat H. | last1=Broeske | first2=Anne | last2=Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sean Young]], who was originally chosen for [[Vicki Vale]] in the previous film, believed the role should have gone to her.

On [[Danny DeVito]]'s casting, Waters explained, &quot;I kind of knew that DeVito was going to play The Penguin. We didn't really officially cast it, but for a short nasty little guy, it's a short list. I ended up writing the character for Danny DeVito.&quot;&lt;ref name=beetle/&gt;

===Filming===
[[File:Batman Returns set.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Gotham City]] Square set built inside Studio 16 on Warner Bros. Studios.]]
In early 1991, two of Hollywood's largest [[sound stage]]s (Stage 16 at Warner Bros. and Stage 12 at [[Universal Studios]]) were being prepared for the filming of ''Batman Returns''.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt; Filming started in June 1991.&lt;ref name=Sally/&gt; Stage 16 held Gotham Plaza, based on [[Rockefeller Center]]. Universal's Stage 12 housed Penguin's underground lair. A half-a-million gallon tank filled with water was used.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt; Burton wanted to make sure that the penguins felt comfortable.&lt;ref name=Sally/&gt; Eight other locations on the Warner Bros. lot were used, over 50% of their property was occupied by [[Gotham City]] sets.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt;

[[Animal rights]] groups started protesting the film after finding out that penguins would have rockets strapped on their backs. Richard Hill, the [[curator]] of the penguins, explained that Warner Bros. was very helpful in making sure the penguins were comfortable.&lt;ref name=Ow/&gt; &quot;On the flight over the plane was refrigerated down to 45 degrees&quot;, recalls Hill. &quot;In Hollywood, they were given a refrigerated trailer, their own swimming pool, half-a-ton of ice each day, and they had fresh fish delivered daily straight from the docks. Even though it was 100 degrees outside, the entire set was refrigerated down to 35 degrees.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ow&gt;Owain Yolland (August 1992). &quot;Two minutes, Mr Penguin&quot;, ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'', pp. 89—90. Retrieved August 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Warner Bros. devoted a large amount of secrecy for ''Batman Returns''. The [[art department]] was required to keep their office blinds pulled down. Cast and crew had to have photo ID badges with the movie's [[Working title#Title ruse|fake working title]] ''Dictel'' to go anywhere near the sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Steve Daly | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,310819,00.html | title = Sets Appeal: Designing ''Batman Returns'' |work=Entertainment Weekly | date = June 19, 1992 | accessdate =August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kevin Costner]] was refused a chance to visit the set. An entertainment magazine leaked the first photos of Danny DeVito as the Penguin; in response Warner Bros. employed a [[private investigator]] to track down the accomplice.&lt;ref name=Mad/&gt; $65 million was spent during the production of ''Batman Returns'', while $15 million was used for marketing, coming to a total cost of $80 million.&lt;ref name=Mac/&gt; The final shot of Catwoman looking at the [[Bat-Signal]] was completed during [[post-production]] and was not part of the [[shooting script]]. After ''Batman Returns'' was completed Warner Bros. felt it was best for Catwoman to survive, saving more characterizations in a future installment. Pfeiffer was unavailable and a [[body double]] was chosen.&lt;ref name=cinema/&gt;

===Design and effects===

More than 60 [[Catsuit]]s were designed in the six-month shoot at $1,000 each.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Fennell (August 1992). &quot;The Catsuit&quot;, ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'', pp. 47—49. Retrieved August 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Batsuit]] was updated, which was made out of a thinner, slightly more flexible foam rubber material than the suit from ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]''. DeVito was uncomfortable with his costume, but this made it easy for him to get into character. [[J. P. Morgan]]'s wardrobe was used for inspiration on Max Shreck's [[costume design]].&lt;ref&gt;Bob Ringwood, [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], ''Sleek, Sexy and Sinister: The Costumes of Batman Returns'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{main|Batman Returns (soundtrack)}}

[[Danny Elfman]] had great enthusiasm for returning because &quot;I didn't have to prove myself from the first film. I remember [[Jon Peters]] was very skeptical at first to hire me.&quot;&lt;ref name=inside&gt;[[Danny Elfman]], ''Inside the Elfman Studios: The Music of Batman Returns'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt; Elfman's work schedule was 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. &quot;When completing this movie I realized it was something of a [[film score]] and an opera. It was 95 minutes long, twice the amount of the average of film score.&quot;&lt;ref name=inside/&gt; Burton allowed Elfman to be more artistic with the sequel score, such as the &quot;scraping&quot; on violins for the cat themes. Under the pressure of finishing the score, however, the relationship between the two strained, which - along with further &quot;creative differences&quot; on ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''&lt;ref name=Danny&gt;Salisbury, Burton, pp.137-144&lt;/ref&gt; - led Burton to use [[Howard Shore]] to score his next film ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =

''Batman Returns'' has received a favourable critical reception. Based on 67 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 80% of critics enjoyed the film, with an average rating of 6.7/10.

[[Janet Maslin]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' thought that &quot;Mr. Burton creates a wicked world of misfits, all of them rendered with the mixture of horror, sympathy and playfulness that has become this director's hallmark.&quot; She described Michael Keaton as showing &quot;appropriate earnestness&quot;, [[Danny DeVito]] as &quot;conveying verve&quot;, Christopher Walken as &quot;wonderfully debonair&quot;, Michelle Pfeiffer as &quot;captivating... fierce, seductive&quot;, Bo Welch's production design as &quot;dazzling&quot;, Stefan Czapsky's cinematography as &quot;crisp&quot;, and [[Daniel Waters (screenwriter)|Daniel Waters]]'s screenplay as &quot;sharp.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CEFDF1539F93AA25755C0A964958260 | title = Movie Review—Batman Returns |work=The New York Times | author = [[Janet Maslin]] | date = June 19, 1992 | accessdate =November 17, 2009|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080511225309/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E0CEFDF1539F93AA25755C0A964958260 |archivedate = May 11, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Travers]] in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote: &quot;Burton uses the summer's most explosively entertaining movie to lead us back into the liberating darkness of dreams.&quot; He praised the performances: &quot;Pfeiffer gives this feminist avenger a tough core of intelligence and wit; she's a classic dazzler... Michael Keaton's manic-depressive hero remains a remarkably rich creation. And Danny DeVito's mutant Penguin—a balloon-bellied ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' with a kingdom of sewer freaks—is as hilariously warped as [[Jack Nicholson]]'s [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] and even quicker with the quips.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5949279/review/5949280/batman_returns | title = Batman Returns | work = [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]] | author = [[Peter Travers]] | date = February 7, 2001 | accessdate =August 14, 2008|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071104160020/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5949279/review/5949280/batman_returns |archivedate = November 4, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Desson Thomson|Desson Howe]] in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' wrote: &quot;Director Burton not only re-creates his one-of-a-kind atmosphere, he one-ups it, even two-ups it. He's best at evoking the psycho-murky worlds in which his characters reside. The Penguin holds court in a penguin-crowded, ''[[The Phantom of the Opera|Phantom of the Opera]]''-like sewer home. Keaton hides in a castlelike mansion, which perfectly mirrors its owner's inner remoteness. Comic strip purists will probably never be happy with a ''Batman'' movie. But ''Returns'' comes closer than ever to [[Bob Kane]]'s dark, original strip, which began in 1939.&quot; He described Walken as &quot;engaging&quot;, DeVito as &quot;exquisite&quot; and Pfeiffer as &quot;deliciously purry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/batmanreturnspg13howe_a07fbb.htm | title = Batman Returns |work=The Washington Post | author = Desson Howe | date = June 19, 1992 | accessdate =August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd McCarthy in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that &quot;the real accomplishment of the film lies in the amazing physical realization of an imaginative universe. Where Burton's ideas end and those of his collaborators begin is impossible to know, but the result is a seamless, utterly consistent universe full of nasty notions about societal deterioration, greed and other base impulses.&quot; He praised the contributions of [[Stan Winston]], [[Danny Elfman]], Bo Welch and cinematographer Stefan Czapsky, and in terms of performances, opined that &quot;the deck is stacked entirely in favor of the villains&quot;, calling DeVito &quot;fascinating&quot; and Pfeiffer &quot;very tasty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117901465.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 | title = Batman Returns |work = Variety | author = Todd McCarthy | date = June 15, 1992 | accessdate =August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film two stars, writing: &quot;I give the movie a negative review, and yet I don't think it's a bad movie; it's more misguided, made with great creativity, but denying us what we more or less deserve from a ''Batman'' story. No matter how hard you try, superheroes and [[film noir]] don't go together; the very essence of noir is that there are no more heroes.&quot; He compared the Penguin negatively with the Joker of the first film, writing that &quot;the Penguin is a curiously meager and depressing creature; I pitied him, but did not fear him or find him funny. The genius of Danny DeVito is all but swallowed up in the paraphernalia of the role.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = [[Roger Ebert]] | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19920619/REVIEWS/206190301/1023 | title = Batman | accessdate =August 14, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080807203730/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19920619/REVIEWS/206190301/1023| archivedate= August 7, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] called DeVito &quot;a pale substitute for [[Jack Nicholson]] from the first film&quot; and felt that &quot;there's no suspense in ''Batman Returns'' whatsoever&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] | title = Batman | work = [[Chicago Reader]] | url = http://onfilm.chicagoreader.com/movies/capsules/771_BATMAN_RETURNS | date = June 19, 1992 | accessdate =August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Batman comic book writer/artist [[Matt Wagner]] was quoted as saying: &quot;I hated how ''Batman Returns'' made Batman little more than just another costumed creep, little better than the villains he's pursuing. Additionally, Burton is so blatantly not an action director. That aspect of both his films just sucked.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Bill &quot;Jett&quot; Ramey | url = http://www.batman-on-film.com/interview_mattwagner_jett_2006.html | title = Interview: Matt Wagner | work = Batman-on-Film | date = September 30, 2006 | accessdate =August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ty Burr in ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a B-; he wrote that &quot;Burton still hasn't figured out how to tell a coherent story: He's more interested in fashioning pretty beads than in putting them on a string.... Yet for all the wintry weirdness, there's more going on under the surface of this movie than in the original. No wonder some people felt burned by ''Batman Returns'': Tim Burton just may have created the first blockbuster art film.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Burr|first=Ty|title=Video Review: Batman Returns|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,312091,00.html|accessdate=April 17, 2012|newspaper=Entertainment Weekly|date=October 23, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A &quot;parental backlash&quot; criticized ''Batman Returns'' with violence and sexual references that were unsuitable for children. [[McDonald's]] shut down their [[Happy Meal]] promotion for the film.&lt;ref&gt;Olly Richards (September 1992). &quot;Trouble in Gotham&quot;, ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'', pp. 21—23. Retrieved August 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Burton responded, &quot;I like ''Batman Returns'' better than the first one. There was this big backlash that it was too dark, but I found this movie much less dark.&quot;&lt;ref name=Sally/&gt;

{{Quote box|width=40%|align=right|quote=&quot;After the traumas of the ''Batman Returns'' she has amnesia, and she doesn't really remember why she has all these bullet holes in her body, so she goes to relax in Oasisburg. What Gotham City is to New York, Oasisburg is to Las Vegas–Los Angeles–Palm Springs. [It's a] resort area in the middle of the desert. It's run by superheroes, and the movie has great fun at making fun at the whole male superhero mythos. Then they end up being not very good at all deep down, and she's got to go back to that whole Catwoman thing.&quot;|source=—Daniel Waters on his script for ''Catwoman''&lt;ref name=beetle/&gt;}}

''Batman Returns'' was the last film in the [[Batman in film|''Batman'' film series]] that featured [[Tim Burton]] and [[Michael Keaton]] as director and leading actor, respectively. With the following film, ''[[Batman Forever]]'', Warner Bros. decided to go in a &quot;lighter&quot; direction to be more [[mainstream]] in the process of a [[family film]]. Burton was asked to restrict himself to the role of producer and approved of [[Joel Schumacher]] as director.&lt;ref name=Russo&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,308195,00.html | title = 'Batman 3' |work=Entertainment Weekly | date = October 1, 1993 | accessdate = August 16, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080921055255/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,308195,00.html| archivedate= September 21, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Warner Bros.]] moving on development for ''Batman Forever'' in June 1993, a ''Catwoman'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] was announced. [[Michelle Pfeiffer]] was to reprise her role, with the character not to appear in ''Forever'' because of &quot;her own little movie&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR107881 | title = Dish | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = June 17, 1993 | accessdate = August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burton became attached as director, while producer [[Denise Di Novi]] and writer [[Daniel Waters (screenwriter)|Daniel Waters]] also returned to the ''Catwoman'' spin-off with Burton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR109036 | title = Another life at WB for ''Catwoman'' and Burton? | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = July 22, 1993 | accessdate = August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1994, Burton was unsure of his plans to direct ''Catwoman'' or an adaptation of ''[[The Fall of the House of Usher]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR117395 | title = Seagal on the pulpit may be too much for WB | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = January 13, 1994 | accessdate = August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, 1995, Waters turned in his ''Catwoman'' script to Warner Bros., the same day ''Batman Forever'' was released. Burton was still being courted to direct. Waters joked, &quot;turning it in the day ''Batman Forever'' opened may not have been my best logistical move, in that it's the celebration of the fun-for-the-whole-family Batman. ''Catwoman'' is definitely not a fun-for-the-whole-family script.&quot;&lt;ref name=beetle/&gt; The film labored in [[development hell]] for years, with Pfeiffer getting replaced by [[Ashley Judd]]. The film ended up becoming the critically panned ''[[Catwoman (film)|Catwoman]]'' (2004) starring [[Halle Berry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117796285 | title = WB: Judd purr-fect as ''Cat'' | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = April 2, 2001 | accessdate = August 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/catwoman/ | title = Catwoman | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate = August 15, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080814183849/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/catwoman/| archivedate= August 14, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
