Alternative algebra
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{more footnotes|date=January 2013}}
In [[abstract algebra]], an '''alternative algebra''' is an [[algebra over a field|algebra]] in which multiplication need not be [[associative]], only [[alternativity|alternative]]. That is, one must have
*&lt;math&gt;x(xy) = (xx)y&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;(yx)x = y(xx)&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''x'' and ''y'' in the algebra.

Every [[associative algebra]] is obviously alternative, but so too are some strictly [[non-associative algebra]]s such as the [[octonion]]s. The [[sedenion]]s, on the other hand, are not alternative.

==The associator==

Alternative algebras are so named because they are precisely the algebras for which the [[associator]] is [[alternating form|alternating]]. The associator is a [[multilinear map|trilinear map]] given by
:&lt;math&gt;[x,y,z] = (xy)z - x(yz)&lt;/math&gt;
By definition a multilinear map is alternating if it vanishes whenever two of its arguments are equal. The left and right alternative identities for an algebra are equivalent to&lt;ref name=Sch27&gt;Schafer (1995) p.27&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[x,x,y] = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[y,x,x] = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
Both of these identities together imply that the associator is totally [[skew-symmetric graph|skew-symmetric]]. That is,
:&lt;math&gt;[x_{\sigma(1)}, x_{\sigma(2)}, x_{\sigma(3)}] = \sgn(\sigma)[x_1,x_2,x_3]&lt;/math&gt;
for any [[permutation]] σ. It follows that
:&lt;math&gt;[x,y,x] = 0&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''x'' and ''y''. This is equivalent to the ''[[flexible identity]]''&lt;ref name=Sch28&gt;Schafer (1995) p.28&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(xy)x = x(yx).&lt;/math&gt;
The associator of an alternative algebra is therefore alternating. Conversely, any algebra whose associator is alternating is clearly alternative. By symmetry, any algebra which satisfies any two of:
*left alternative identity: &lt;math&gt;x(xy) = (xx)y&lt;/math&gt;
*right alternative identity: &lt;math&gt;(yx)x = y(xx)&lt;/math&gt;
*flexible identity: &lt;math&gt;(xy)x = x(yx).&lt;/math&gt;
is alternative and therefore satisfies all three identities.

An alternating associator is always totally skew-symmetric. The converse holds so long as the [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] of the base field is not 2.

==Examples==
* Every [[associative algebra]] is alternative.
* The [[octonion]]s form a non-associative alternative algebra, a normed division algebra of dimension 8 over the real numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=John Horton Conway | last1=Conway | first1=John Horton | last2=Smith | first2=Derek A. | year=2003 | title=On Quaternions and Octonions: Their Geometry, Arithmetic, and Symmetry | publisher=A. K. Peters | isbn=1-56881-134-9 | zbl=1098.17001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* More generally, any [[octonion algebra]] is alternative.

==Properties==
'''Artin's theorem''' states that in an alternative algebra the [[subalgebra]] generated by any two elements is [[associative]].&lt;ref name=Sch29&gt;Schafer (1995) p.29&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, any algebra for which this is true is clearly alternative. It follows that expressions involving only two variables can be written without parenthesis unambiguously in an alternative algebra. A generalization of Artin's theorem states that whenever three elements &lt;math&gt;x,y,z&lt;/math&gt; in an alternative algebra associate (i.e. &lt;math&gt;[x,y,z] = 0&lt;/math&gt;) the subalgebra generated by those elements is associative.

A corollary of Artin's theorem is that alternative algebras are [[power-associative]], that is, the subalgebra generated by a single element is associative.&lt;ref name=Sch30&gt;Schafer (1995) p.30&lt;/ref&gt;  The converse need not hold: the [[sedenion]]s are power-associative but not alternative.

The [[Moufang identities]]
*&lt;math&gt;a(x(ay)) = (axa)y&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;((xa)y)a = x(aya)&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;(ax)(ya) = a(xy)a&lt;/math&gt;
hold in any alternative algebra.&lt;ref name=Sch28/&gt;

In a unital alternative algebra, multiplicative inverses are unique whenever they exist. Moreover, for any invertible element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; one has
:&lt;math&gt;y = x^{-1}(xy).&lt;/math&gt;
This is equivalent to saying the associator &lt;math&gt;[x^{-1},x,y]&lt;/math&gt; vanishes for all such &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are invertible then &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; is also invertible with inverse &lt;math&gt;(xy)^{-1} = y^{-1}x^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. The set of all invertible elements is therefore closed under multiplication and forms a [[Moufang loop]]. This ''loop of units'' in an alternative ring or algebra is analogous to the [[group of units]] in an associative ring or algebra.

Zorn's theorem states that any finite-dimensional non-associative alternative algebra is a generalised octonion algebra.&lt;ref name=Sch56&gt;Schafer (1995) p.56&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The projective plane over any alternative division ring is a [[Moufang plane]].

The close relationship of alternative algebras and [[composition algebra]]s was given by Guy Roos in 2008: He shows (page 162) the relation for an algebra ''A'' with unit element ''e'' and an [[involution (mathematics)|involutive]] [[anti-automorphism]] &lt;math&gt;a \mapsto a^*&lt;/math&gt; such that ''a'' + ''a''* and ''aa''* are on the line [[linear span|spanned]] by ''e'' for all ''a'' in ''A''. Use the notation ''n''(''a'') = ''aa''*. Then if ''n'' is a non-singular mapping into the field of ''A'', and ''A'' is alternative, then (''A,n'') is a composition algebra.
