===Internet censorship and surveillance===

There are no government restrictions on access to the Internet or credible reports that the government monitors [[e-mail]] or Internet [[chat rooms]].&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-Burundi-2012&gt;[http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/humanrightsreport/index.htm?year=2012&amp;dlid=204095 &quot;Burundi&quot;], ''Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012'', Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 10 April 2013. Retrieved 24 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Operating in a turbulent political climate, Burundi's media are subject to occasional government [[censorship]] and may practice [[self-censorship]].&lt;ref name=BBCNewProfile-Burundi-2013/&gt; 

The constitution and law provide for [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press|press]], and the government generally respects these rights. The law prohibits the media from spreading &quot;[[hate speech|hate]]&quot; messages or from using abusive or defamatory language against public servants acting in their official role that could damage the dignity of or respect for the public office. [[Libel]] laws prohibit the public distribution of information that exposes a person to &quot;[[Contempt|public contempt]]&quot; and carry penalties of prison terms and fines. The crime of [[treason]], which includes knowingly demoralizing the military or the nation in a manner that endangers national defense during a time of war, carries a criminal penalty of life imprisonment. It is a crime for anyone knowingly to disseminate or publicize false rumors likely to alarm or excite the public against the government or to promote civil war. It is illegal for anyone to display drawings, posters, photographs, or other items that may disturb the [[public order|public peace]]. Penalties range from two months' to three years' imprisonment and fines. Some journalists, lawyers, and political party, civil society, and NGO leaders allege the government uses these laws to intimidate and harass them.&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-Burundi-2012/&gt;

The constitution and law provide for the right to privacy, but the government does not always respect this right in practice. Authorities do not always respect the law requiring search warrants.&lt;ref name=USDOS-CRHRP-Burundi-2012/&gt;
