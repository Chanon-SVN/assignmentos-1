'''''Batman &amp; Robin''''' is a 1997 American [[superhero film]] based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batman]]. It is the fourth and final film of [[Warner Bros.]]' [[Batman in film#Tim Burton/Joel Schumacher series (1989â€“1997)|initial ''Batman'' film series]]. The film was directed by [[Joel Schumacher]] and written by [[Akiva Goldsman]]. It stars [[George Clooney]], [[Chris O'Donnell]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Uma Thurman]], and [[Alicia Silverstone]]. ''Batman &amp; Robin'' tells the story of the Dynamic Duo as they attempt to prevent [[Mr. Freeze]] and [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] from freezing all mankind to death and repopulating the earth with mutant plants, while at the same time struggling to keep their partnership together. This is also the only film appearance of [[Batgirl]], who unexpectedly helps the title characters win in the end.

Warner Bros. fast tracked development for ''Batman &amp; Robin'' following the box office success of the previous film, ''[[Batman Forever]]''. Schumacher and Goldsman conceived the storyline during pre-production on ''[[A Time to Kill (film)|A Time to Kill]]'', while Kilmer decided not to reprise the role over scheduling conflicts with ''[[The Saint (film)|The Saint]]''. Schumacher had a strong interest in casting [[William Baldwin]] in Kilmer's place before George Clooney won the role. [[Principal photography]] began in September 1996 and finished in January 1997, two weeks ahead of the [[shooting schedule]].

''Batman &amp; Robin'' was released on June 20, 1997 to extremely negative reviews and is often regarded as one of the [[List of films considered the worst|worst films ever made]]. Subsequently, Warner Bros. cancelled the unproduced ''[[Batman Triumphant]]'' and the film series was eventually [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]ed with ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005) by director [[Christopher Nolan]]. One of the songs recorded for the film, &quot;[[The End Is the Beginning Is the End]]&quot; by [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], won a [[Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance]] at the [[40th Grammy Awards]].

==Plot==
&lt;!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. --&gt;
[[Batman and Robin (comic book)|Batman and Robin]] attempt to stop [[Mr. Freeze]] from stealing a cache of diamonds. The super-criminal freezes [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] and flees, notifying [[Batman]] that he has 11 minutes to thaw his partner. They learn that Freeze was once scientist Victor Fries, who became dependent on a diamond-powered subzero suit following an accident in a cryogenics lab he was occupying to find a cure for his wife, [[Nora Fries|Nora]], who was suffering from a [[terminal illness]] called Mac Gregor's Syndrome.
	
Meanwhile, botanist Dr. Pamela Isley is experimenting with the strength serum &quot;[[Venom (DC Comics)|Venom]]&quot; to create mutant plants capable of fighting back against mankind's destruction of [[flora]]. To her anger, she discovers that her senior colleague [[Floronic Man|Dr. Jason Woodrue]] used her Venom samples to transform a diminutive prisoner into the &quot;super soldier&quot; [[Bane (comics)|Bane]]. When she refuses to become the mad scientist's partner, Woodrue kills her with animal-plant toxins and chemicals. She transforms into the beautiful [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] and kills Woodrue with a venomous kiss before vowing to use her new powers to establish botanical supremacy over the world.

[[Alfred Pennyworth]]'s niece [[Barbara Gordon|Barbara Wilson]] makes a surprise visit from England and is invited to stay at [[Wayne Manor]] until she returns to university. Alfred is revealed to be suffering from Mac Gregor's Syndrome. He is, however, in stage 1 for which Mr.Freeze had developed a cure. His wife was in a more advanced stage and Mr. Freeze had yet to find a cure for that.

Ivy arrives in Gotham City with Bane as her henchman. She interrupts a Wayne Enterprises press conference at the Gotham Observatory where a giant new telescope is being unveiled, exhorting Bruce Wayne to implement a proposal that would safeguard the natural environment at the expense of millions of human lives, which Bruce summarily declines. She later appears at the Gotham Botanical Gardens fundraiser, seducing everyone present with her [[pheromone]] dust, including the Dynamic Duo, who are there to protect a diamond on auction from Mr. Freeze. When Freeze crashes the event as expected, Ivy is instantly captivated by his &quot;ruthless charm&quot;. Despite being captured by Batman and detained at the [[Arkham Asylum]], Mr. Freeze is released by Ivy.

Ivy then proceeds to turn off Nora Fries' life support and makes Mr. Freeze believe Batman did it, thereby persuading him that they should kill Batman as well as the society that created him. They plan to turn the observatory's new telescope into a giant freezing gun to freeze the whole world's population to death and replace them with Ivy's mutant plants.

Meanwhile, Robin has become infatuated with Ivy and rebels against Batman, just as the villainess planned. He eventually goes to meet her at her garden hide-out. Ivy's venomous kiss fails to kill Robin because Batman had prevailed on him to coat his lips with rubber. She tries to drown Robin in her lily pond and entangles Batman in her crushing vines, although they are able to free themselves when [[Batgirl]] arrives and traps Ivy in her own floral throne. Having discovered the [[Batcave]] and decided to create her own crime-fighting persona with the help of a computer simulation of Alfred with advanced [[AI]], Batgirl reveals herself as Barbara.

When the Trio arrive at the Observatory to stop Freeze, the criminal has already frozen Gotham. Bane attacks Robin and Batgirl, but they incapacitate him and restore him to his original human state. In the battle, the telescope is destroyed, but the two younger heroes save Gotham by repositioning the observatory's satellites, using their mirrors to reflect sunlight from outer space to thaw the city.

Batman shows Freeze video footage of Ivy's confession about pulling the plug on Nora, but reveals that he himself restored Nora. He vows that Freeze will be allowed to continue his research at Arkham Asylum to heal Nora. Batman asks Freeze for the cure he created for the first stage of Mac Gregor's Syndrome for Alfred and Freeze atones for his misdeeds by giving him two vials of the medicine he had developed.

At Arkham, Ivy is joined in her cell by Freeze, who vows to exact revenge on her. Back at Wayne Manor, Alfred is cured and Bruce invites Barbara to live with them and continue helping Batman and Robin fight crime as Batgirl.

==Cast==
* [[George Clooney]] as [[Batman|Bruce Wayne/Batman]] &lt;br/&gt; A billionaire industrialist who witnessed his parents' murder as a young boy. At night, Bruce becomes Batman, Gotham City's vigilante protector. [[Eric Lloyd]] portrays him as a child in a flashback.

* [[Alicia Silverstone]] as [[Barbara Gordon|Barbara Wilson]]/[[Batgirl]] &lt;br&gt; Her parents had previously died in a car accident.  Alfred, her uncle, was very close to her mother, Margaret.

Despite proving more than a match for Batman and Robin earlier on, he is eventually defeated by Robin and Batgirl after they find a way to stop the venom flow to his brain.

* [[Vendela Kirsebom]] as [[Nora Fries]] &lt;br&gt; Mr. Freeze's cryogenically-frozen wife.

According to Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight Part 6: Batman Unbound, Chris O'Donnell revealed that despite hanging out with Arnold Schwarzenegger a lot off set and during promotion for the film, they never worked a single day together. This was achieved with stand in's when one of the actors wasn't available.

===Critical reaction===
{{Quote box|width=35%|align=right|quote=&quot;If there's anybody watching this, that... let's say, loved ''Batman Forever'', and went into ''Batman &amp; Robin'' with great anticipation, if I've disappointed them in any way, then I really want to apologize.

[[Review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 11% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 85 reviews, certifying it &quot;Rotten&quot;, with an average rating of 3.4/10, the consensus: &quot;Joel Schumacher's tongue-in-cheek attitude hits an unbearable limit in ''Batman &amp; Robin'', resulting in a frantic and mindless movie that's too jokey to care much for.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1077027-batman_and_robin/ | title = Batman &amp; Robin | work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate = June 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] collected an average score of 28, based on 21 reviews which is regarded as &lt;!-- cited terminology, do not change. --&gt; &quot;generally unfavorable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/movie/batman-robin | title = Batman &amp; Robin (1997): Reviews | work=[[Metacritic]] | publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate = April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schumacher and producer Peter MacGregor-Scott blamed the negative reception of ''Batman &amp; Robin'' on Warner Bros.' decision to fast track production. &quot;There was a lot of pressure from Warner Bros. to make ''Batman &amp; Robin'' more [[family-friendliness|family-friendly]],&quot; Schumacher explained. &quot;We decided to do a less depressing ''Batman'' movie and less torture and more heroic.

''Batman &amp; Robin'' was nominated for the [[Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film]], as well as [[Saturn Award for Best Make-up|Best Make-up]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Costume|Best Costume]], but won none. [[Alicia Silverstone]] won the [[Golden Raspberry Award|Razzie Award]] for Worst Supporting Actress. Other nominations at the Razzie Awards included Schumacher (Worst Director), George Clooney and Chris O'Donnell (Worst Screen Couple), Akiva Goldsman (Worst Screenplay), both Chris O'Donnell and Arnold Schwarzenegger (Worst Supporting Actor), Uma Thurman (Worst Supporting Actress), as well as [[Billy Corgan]] (Worst Song for &quot;[[The End Is the Beginning Is the End]]&quot;). ''Batman &amp; Robin'' also received nominations for [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture|Worst Picture]], Worst Remake or Sequel and Worst Reckless Disregard for Human Life and Public Property. Ultimately, out of 11 nominations, ''Batman &amp; Robin'' garnered only one Razzie Award.

Many observers thought Schumacher added possible [[homoeroticism|homoerotic]] [[innuendo]] in the storyline.&lt;ref name=shadow/&gt; [[James Berardinelli]] questioned the &quot;random amount ''[sic]'' of rubber nipples and camera angle [[close-up]]s of the Dynamic Duo's butts and Bat-crotches.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=[[James Berardinelli]] | title = Batman and Robin | work=ReelViews.net | url = http://www.reelviews.net/movies/b/batman4.html | accessdate = November 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to ''Batman Forever'', this primarily included the decision to add nipples and enlarged [[codpiece]]s to Batman and Robin suits. Schumacher stated, &quot;I had no idea that putting nipples on the Batsuit and Robin suit were going to spark international headlines. The bodies of the suits come from [[Ancient Greek art|ancient Greek statue]]s, which display perfect bodies. They are anatomically correct.&quot;&lt;ref name=shadow/&gt; Chris O'Donnell, who portrayed Robin, felt &quot;it wasn't so much the nipples that bothered me. It was the codpiece. The press obviously played it up and made it a big deal, especially with Joel directing.

===Canceled sequel and legacy===
{{See also|Batman in film#Batman Triumphant}}
During the filming of ''Batman &amp; Robin'', Warner Bros. was impressed with the [[dailies]], prompting them to immediately hire Joel Schumacher to return as director for a sequel. However, writer [[Akiva Goldsman]] turned down an offer to write the script.&lt;ref name=mike/&gt; In late 1996, Warner Bros. and Schumacher hired [[Mark Protosevich]] to write the script for a fifth ''Batman'' film. A projected mid-1999 release date was announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117435255 | title = Helmer's 3rd At Bat |work=Variety  | date = February 21, 1997 | accessdate = October 17, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081019042349/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117435255| archivedate= October 19, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Titled ''Batman Triumphant'', Protosevich's script had the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow]] as the main villain. Through the use of his fear [[toxin]], he resurrects the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] as a hallucination in Batman's mind. [[Harley Quinn]] appeared as a supporting character, written as the Joker's daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Brian Linder | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/034/034019p1.html | title = Rumblings From Gotham | work=[[IGN]] | date = July 27, 2000 | accessdate = October 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Clooney, Chris O'Donnell, and Alicia Silverstone were set to reprise the roles of Batman, Robin, and Batgirl. However, following the failure of ''Batman &amp; Robin'', Clooney vowed never to reprise his role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Michael Fleming | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116680121 | title = Schumacher trims sails |work=Variety  | date = November 11, 1997 | accessdate = November 11, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081216115456/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116680121| archivedate= December 16, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warner Bros. decided to consider a live-action ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' film and an adaptation of [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[Batman: Year One]]''. Warner would then produce whichever idea suited them the most.&lt;ref name=ass/&gt; Schumacher felt he &quot;owe[d] the Batman culture a real ''Batman'' movie. I would go back to the basics and make a dark portrayal of the Dark Knight.&quot;&lt;ref name=Jen/&gt; He approached Warner Bros. about doing ''Batman: Year One'' in mid-1998,&lt;ref name=Jen&gt;{{cite news | author=Jeff Jensen | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,285969,00.html | title = Winging It |work=Entertainment Weekly | date = December 4, 1998 | accessdate = October 17, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081019113057/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,285969,00.html| archivedate= October 19, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they were more interested in hiring [[Darren Aronofsky]]. Aronofsky and Frank Miller developed a ''Year One'' script with Aronofsky to direct, but it was ultimately canceled. [[Christopher Nolan]] was eventually hired to helm the next ''Batman'' film in January 2003, resulting in the [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]]ed ''[[Batman Begins]]'' (2005).&lt;ref name=ass&gt;{{cite book | author=David Hughes | title = Tales From Development Hell | publisher=[[Titan Books]] |date=March 2004 | location = London | pages = 192â€“211| chapter = The Dark Knight Strikes Out | isbn = 1-84023-691-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In &quot;[[Chemistry (The New Batman Adventures)|Legends of the Dark Knight]]&quot;, an episode of ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', three teenagers discuss their ideas about what Batman is really like. They briefly meet a youth called Joel whose idea of Batman reflects characterizations and costumes portrayed within Schumacher's ''Batman and Robin''.

Additionally, there were worries within [[Warner Bros.]] surrounding the negative critical reaction to ''Batman &amp; Robin'' and how that may come to harm the success of the subsequent direct-to-video animated film ''[[Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'', which was originally planned for release at around the same time as ''Batman &amp; Robin'' but was subsequently delayed.&lt;ref name=&quot;stomptokyo1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stomptokyo.com/movies/batman-subzero.html |title=Stomp Tokyo Video Reviews - Batman &amp; Mr. Freeze: Subzero |publisher=Stomptokyo.com |date=March 25, 1998 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''SubZero'' received a far stronger positive response from critics than ''Batman &amp; Robin'', with Mr. Freeze's role within it being seen in a much more positive light, returning his popularity as a ''Batman'' villain to a level comparable to that reached by him within the two Emmy-winning episodes the character featured in of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;stomptokyo1&quot;/&gt;
