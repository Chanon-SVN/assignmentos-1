==Biblical history==
In the passage from 1 Samuel, [[Nabal]] demonstrates ingratitude towards [[David]], and Abigail attempts to placate David in order to stop him taking revenge. She gives him food, and speaks to him, urging him not to &quot;have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed&quot; (verse 31, [[NIV]]) and reminding him that [[Yahweh|God]] will make him a &quot;[[Davidic line|lasting dynasty]]&quot; (verse 28). [[Jon Levenson]] calls this an &quot;undeniable [[wikt:adumbration|adumbration]]&quot; of [[Nathan (prophet)|Nathan]]'s prophecy in [[Covenant (biblical)#Davidic covenant|2 Samuel 7]].&lt;ref name=Levenson&gt;[[Jon D. Levenson]], &quot;1 Samuel 25 as Literature and History,&quot; ''[[Catholic Biblical Quarterly|CBQ]]'' 40 [1978] 20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alice Bach]] notes that Abigail pronounces a &quot;crucial prophecy,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alice Bach]], &quot;[http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=1945&amp;C=1780 The Pleasure of Her Text],&quot; ''[[Union Seminary Quarterly Review]]'' 43 [1989] 44.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Talmud]] regards her as one of the [[Tanakh]]'s seven female prophets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] [http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Megilah.pdf 14a]&lt;/ref&gt; Levenson, however, suggests that she &quot;senses the drift of history&quot; from intelligence rather than from special revelation.&lt;ref name=Levenson /&gt;

After Abigail reveals to Nabal what she has done, &quot;[[Yahweh]] struck Nabal and he died,&quot; (v.38), after which David married her.

The text explicitly describes Abigail as &quot;intelligent and beautiful&quot; (1 Samuel 25:3, [[NIV]], also in the [[JPS Tanakh]]). The [[Talmud]] amplifies this idea, mentioning her as being one of the &quot;four women of surpassing beauty in the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] [http://www.halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Megilah.pdf 15a]&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of her moral character, [[Abraham Kuyper]] argues that Abigail's conduct indicates &quot;a most appealing character and unwavering faith,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham Kuyper]], ''Women of the Old Testament'' (Grand Rapids: Zondervan, 1941), 106.&lt;/ref&gt; but Alice Bach regards her as subversive.&lt;ref&gt;Alice Bach, &quot;[http://www.religion-online.org/showchapter.asp?title=1945&amp;C=1780 The Pleasure of Her Text],&quot; ''Union Seminary Quarterly Review'' 43 [1989] 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jon D. Levenson|Levenson]] and [[Halpern]] suggest that Abigail may, in fact, also be the same person as [[Abigail (mother of Amasa)|Abigail, mother of Amasa]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jon D. Levenson]] and [[Baruch Halpern]], &quot;The Political Import of David's Marriages,&quot; ''[[Journal of Biblical Literature|JBL]]'' 99 [1980] 511–512.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard M. Davidson]], however, points out that &quot;on the basis of the final form of Old Testament canon, references to Abigail in the biblical accounts indicate two different individuals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davidson|first=Richard M.|author-link=Richard M. Davidson|title=Flame of Yahweh: A Theology of Sexuality in the Old Testament|year=2007|publisher=Hendrickson|page=444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generic use==
Abigail's self-styling as a ''[[handmaid]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Samuel|25:25|}} and following&lt;/ref&gt; led to ''Abigail'' being the traditional term for a waiting-woman, for example as the ''waiting [[gentlewoman]]'' in [[Beaumont and Fletcher]]'s ''[[The Scornful Lady]]'', published in 1616. [[Jonathan Swift]] and [[Henry Fielding]] use ''Abigail'' in this generic sense, as does [[Charlotte Brontë]]. [[Anthony Trollope]] makes two references to ''the abigail'' (all lower case) in ''[[The Eustace Diamonds]]'', at the beginning of Chapter 42, whilst [[Thomas Mann]] makes the same reference at the start of the second chapter of Part 2 in [[Buddenbrooks]] (published in 1901). [[William Rose Benet]] notes the notoriety of [[Abigail Hill]], better known as &quot;Mrs Masham&quot;, a [[lady-in-waiting]] to [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Reader's Encyclopedia'', 1948, ''s.v.'' &quot;Abigail&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George MacDonald Fraser]] makes mention of &quot;an ''abigail'' fussing about the room&quot; in his novel [[Flashman]] from The Flashman Papers series.
