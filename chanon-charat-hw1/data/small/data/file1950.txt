'''Beer''' is an [[alcoholic beverage]] produced by the [[Hydrolysis|saccharification]] of [[starch]] and [[Fermentation (food)|fermentation]] of the resulting sugar. The starch and saccharification [[enzyme]]s are often derived from malted cereal grains, most commonly [[malt]]ed barley and malted wheat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barth 2014&quot;&gt;Barth, Roger.

Almost any substance containing sugar can naturally undergo alcoholic fermentation. It is likely that many cultures, on observing that a sweet liquid could be obtained from a source of starch, independently invented beer.

==Brewing==
{{Main|Brewing}}
[[File:The Brewer designed and engraved in the Sixteenth. Century by J Amman.png|thumb|left|upright|A 16th-century brewery]]
The process of making beer is known as brewing. A dedicated building for the making of beer is called a brewery, though beer can be made in the home and has been for much of its history. A company that makes beer is called either a brewery or a [[brewing company]]. Beer made on a domestic scale for non-commercial reasons is classified as [[homebrewing]] regardless of where it is made, though most homebrewed beer is made in the home. Brewing beer is subject to legislation and taxation in [[developed countries]], which from the late 19th century largely restricted brewing to a commercial operation only. However, the UK government relaxed legislation in 1963, followed by Australia in 1972 and the USA in 1978, allowing homebrewing to become a popular hobby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homebrew4u.co.uk/news-articles/breaking-homebrewing-law-in-alabama.asp|title=Breaking the Home Brewing Law in Alabama|publisher=Homebrew4u.co.uk|accessdate=28 September 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081009023506/http://www.homebrew4u.co.uk/news-articles/breaking-homebrewing-law-in-alabama.asp|archivedate=9 October 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of brewing is to convert the starch source into a sugary liquid called [[wort]] and to convert the wort into the alcoholic beverage known as beer in a fermentation process effected by [[Brewer's yeast|yeast]].

{{Realale Brewing}}
The first step, where the wort is prepared by mixing the starch source (normally malted barley) with hot water, is known as &quot;[[mashing]]&quot;. Hot water (known as &quot;liquor&quot; in brewing terms) is mixed with crushed malt or malts (known as &quot;[[grist]]&quot;) in a [[mash tun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beer-pages.com/protz/features/protz-the-brewer.htm|title=Roger Protz tries his hand at brewing|publisher=Beer-pages.com|date=June 2007|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mashing process takes around 1 to 2 hours,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abgbrew.com/brewerslog.htm ABGbrew.com] Steve Parkes, ''British Brewing'', American Brewers Guild.&lt;/ref&gt; during which the starches are converted to sugars, and then the sweet wort is drained off the grains. The grains are now washed in a process known as &quot;sparging&quot;. This washing allows the brewer to gather as much of the fermentable liquid from the grains as possible. The process of filtering the spent grain from the wort and sparge water is called ''wort separation''. The traditional process for wort separation is [[lautering]], in which the grain bed itself serves as the filter medium. Some modern breweries prefer the use of filter frames which allow a more finely ground grist.&lt;ref&gt;Goldhammer, Ted (2008), ''The Brewer's Handbook'', 2nd ed., Apex, ISBN 978-0-9675212-3-7 pp. 181 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern breweries use a continuous sparge, collecting the original wort and the sparge water together. However, it is possible to collect a second or even third wash with the not quite spent grains as separate batches. Each run would produce a weaker wort and thus a weaker beer. This process is known as second (and third) runnings. Brewing with several runnings is called parti gyle brewing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://morebeer.com/brewingtechniques/library/backissues/issue2.2/mosher.html Brewingtechniques.com], Randy Mosher, &quot;Parti-Gyle Brewing&quot;, ''Brewing Techniques'', March/April 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

The sweet wort collected from sparging is put into a kettle, or &quot;copper&quot;, (so called because these vessels were traditionally made from copper)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/phase-trans/2005/brewing.html|title=Copper Brewing Vessels|publisher=Msm.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=28 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and boiled, usually for about one hour. During boiling, water in the wort evaporates, but the sugars and other components of the wort remain; this allows more efficient use of the starch sources in the beer. Boiling also destroys any remaining enzymes left over from the mashing stage. [[Hops]] are added during boiling as a source of bitterness, flavour and aroma. Hops may be added at more than one point during the boil. The longer the hops are boiled, the more bitterness they contribute, but the less hop flavour and aroma remains in the beer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cr9Pv0gefCQC&amp;pg=PA274&amp;dq=hops+boiled+brewing&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U20D5Blv8GqmsNXncZ7twjbH50Zxg#PPA275,M1 Books.google.co.uk], Michael Lewis, Tom W. Young, ''Brewing'', page 275, Springer (2002), ISBN 0-306-47274-0&lt;/ref&gt;

After boiling, the hopped wort is now cooled, ready for the yeast. In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add aromatic hop flavouring and to act as a filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months depending on the type of yeast and strength of the beer. In addition to producing [[ethanol]], fine [[Suspended solids|particulate matter]] suspended in the wort settles during fermentation. Once fermentation is complete, the yeast also settles, leaving the beer clear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beer-brewing.com/apex/beer_chapters/ch06_beer_adjuncts.htm beer-brewing.com Beer-brewing.com]{{dead link|date=January 2014}}, Ted Goldammer, ''The Brewers Handbook'', Chapter 13&amp;nbsp;– Beer Fermentation, Apex Pub (1 January 2000), ISBN 0-9675212-0-3.

Fermentation is sometimes carried out in two stages, primary and secondary. Once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation, the beer is transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of [[Brewing#Secondary fermentation|secondary fermentation]]. Secondary fermentation is used when the beer requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cr9Pv0gefCQC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=secondary+fermentation+brewing&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U3T7G6RMyj_w9QtnLY9ZeANNuSshQ Google Books] Michael Lewis, Tom W.

Regions have water with different mineral components; as a result, different regions were originally better suited to making certain types of beer, thus giving them a regional character.&lt;ref name=&quot;geot&quot;/&gt; For example, [[Dublin]] has [[hard water]] well-suited to making [[stout]], such as [[Guinness]]; while the [[Plzeň Region]] has soft water well-suited to making [[Pilsner]] ([[pale lager]]), such as [[Pilsner Urquell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;geot&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/aug04/resources.html|title=Geology and Beer|work=Geotimes|date=August 2004|accessdate=5 November 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927200414/http://www.agiweb.org/geotimes/aug04/resources.html|archivedate=27 September 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The waters of [[Burton Bridge Brewery|Burton]] in England contain [[gypsum]], which benefits making [[pale ale]] to such a degree that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as [[Burtonisation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000098.html] Michael Jackson, ''BeerHunter'', 19 October 1991, &quot;Brewing a good glass of water&quot;. Retrieved 13 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Starch source===
{{Main|Malt|Mash ingredients}}
The starch source in a beer provides the fermentable material and is a key determinant of the strength and flavour of the beer. The most common starch source used in beer is malted grain. Grain is malted by soaking it in water, allowing it to begin [[germination]], and then drying the partially germinated grain in a kiln. Malting grain produces enzymes that convert starches in the grain into fermentable sugars.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:en:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Brewing/Chemistry|Wikisource]] 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica''/Brewing/Chemistry. Retrieved 29 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Different roasting times and temperatures are used to produce different colours of malt from the same grain. Darker malts will produce darker beers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farm-direct.co.uk/farming/stockcrop/barley/malt.html Farm-direct.co.uk] Oz, ''Barley Malt'', 6 February 2002. Retrieved 29 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly all beer includes barley malt as the majority of the starch. This is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during threshing. After malting, barley is milled, which finally removes the hull, breaking it into large pieces. These pieces remain with the grain during the [[Mashing|mash]], and act as a filter bed during [[lautering]], when sweet [[wort]] is separated from insoluble grain material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, [[oats]], and [[rye]], and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. In recent years, a few brewers have produced [[gluten-free beer]], made with sorghum with no barley malt, for those who cannot consume [[gluten]]-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Carolyn|last=Smagalski|year=2006|url=http://www.bellaonline.com/articles/art39558.asp|title=CAMRA &amp; The First International Gluten Free Beer Festival|publisher=Carolyn Smagalski, Bella Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hops===

Flavouring beer is the sole major commercial use of hops.&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Burgess, ''Hops: Botany, Cultivation and Utilization'', Leonard Hill (1964), ISBN 0-471-12350-1&lt;/ref&gt; The flower of the [[Humulus lupulus|hop vine]] is used as a flavouring and preservative agent in nearly all beer made today. The flowers themselves are often called &quot;hops&quot;.

The first historical mention of the use of hops in beer was from 822 AD in monastery rules written by Adalhard the Elder, also known as [[Adalard of Corbie]],&lt;ref name=&quot;sotp&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- p62 --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bmar&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard W|last=Unger|title=Beer in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance|pages=54–55|isbn=0-8122-3795-1|year=2004|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;sotp&quot;/&gt;&lt;!-- p63 --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bmar&quot;/&gt; Before the thirteenth century, and until the sixteenth century, during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring, beer was flavoured with other plants; for instance, ''[[Glechoma hederacea#Cultivation and uses|Glechoma hederacea]]''.

Hops contain several characteristics that brewers desire in beer. Hops contribute a bitterness that balances the sweetness of the malt; the bitterness of beers is measured on the [[International Bitterness Units scale]]. Hops contribute floral, citrus, and herbal aromas and flavours to beer.

===Yeast===
{{Main|Brewer's yeast|Saccharomyces cerevisiae|Saccharomyces uvarum}}
Yeast is the [[microorganism]] that is responsible for fermentation in beer. Yeast [[metabolism|metabolises]] the sugars extracted from grains, which produces [[Ethanol|alcohol]] and [[carbon dioxide]], and thereby turns [[wort]] into beer. In addition to fermenting the beer, yeast influences the character and flavour.&lt;ref&gt;Ostergaard, S., Olsson, L., Nielsen, J., [http://mmbr.asm.org/content/64/1/34.full Metabolic Engineering of Saccharomyces cerevisiae], Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000 64: 34–50&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant types of yeast used to make beer are the [[Top-fermenting yeast|top-fermenting]] ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' and [[bottom-fermenting]] ''[[Saccharomyces uvarum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=0kefSj0_i9sC&amp;pg=PA376&amp;dq=types+of+yeast+used+to+make+beer&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U3MoveTthnLMs94MsIoa2B8EU-lAQ Google Books] Paul R.

===Clarifying agent===
{{Main|Finings}}
Some brewers add one or more clarifying agents to beer, which typically [[precipitate]] (collect as a solid) out of the beer along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product. This process makes the beer appear [[Bright beer|bright]] and clean, rather than the cloudy appearance of ethnic and older styles of beer such as [[wheat beer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000717.html|title=Michael Jackson's Beer Hunter&amp;nbsp;— A pint of cloudy, please|publisher=Beerhunter.com|accessdate=28 September 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080926132813/http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000717.html|archivedate=26 September 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of clarifying agents include [[isinglass]], obtained from [[swimbladder]]s of fish; [[Chondrus crispus|Irish moss]], a seaweed; kappa [[carrageenan]], from the seaweed ''[[Kappaphycus cottonii]]''; [[Polyclar]] (artificial); and [[gelatin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/536.htm EFSA.europa.eu] ''Opinion of the Scientific Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies'', 23 August 2007.

The [[Benedictine]] [[Weihenstephan]] Brewery in [[Bavaria]], Germany, can trace its roots to the year 768, as a document from that year refers to a hop garden in the area paying a tithe to the monastery. The brewery was licensed by the City of [[Freising]] in 1040, and therefore is the oldest working brewery in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Giebel, Wieland, ed (1992). The New Germany. Singapore: Höfer Press Pte. Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest brewery with discontinuous production is the [[Břevnov Monastery]] in the [[Czech Republic]], which was founded in 993.

The brewing industry is a global business, consisting of several dominant [[Multinational corporation|multinational companies]] and many thousands of smaller producers ranging from brewpubs to [[regional brewery|regional breweries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;market&quot;/&gt; More than 133 billion liters (35 billion gallons) are sold per year—producing total global revenues of $294.5 billion (£147.7 billion) as of 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;researchandmarkets1&quot;/&gt;

A microbrewery, or craft brewery, is a modern brewery which produces a limited amount of beer. The maximum amount of beer a brewery can produce and still be classed as a microbrewery varies by region and by authority, though is usually around 15,000 barrels (1.8 megalitres, 396 thousand imperial gallons or 475 thousand US gallons) a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brewersassociation.org/pages/business-tools/craft-brewing-statistics/market-segments|title=Market Segments: Microbrewery|year=2012|publisher=Brewers Association|accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A brewpub is a type of microbrewery that incorporates a [[public house|pub]] or other [[bar (establishment)|eating establishment]].

=== International Breweries ===

Since the globalisation of the beer market near the end of the 20th century, becoming the largest brewery has been a game of merging with and overtaking other large breweries.

* In 2002, the foundation of [[South African Breweries]] bought the North American [[Miller Brewing Company]] to found [[SABMiller]], becoming the second largest brewery, after North American [[Anheuser-Bush]].
* In 2004, the Belgian [[Interbrew]] was the third largest brewery by volume and the Brazilian [[AmBev]] was the fifth largest. They merged into [[InBev]], becoming the largest brewery. 
* In 2007, [[SABMiller]] surpassed InBev and Anheuser-Bush when it acquired Royal Grolsch, brewer of Dutch premium beer brand [[Grolsch]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/BUSINESS/05/30/sab.miller/|title=Brewer to snap up Miller for $5.6B|work=CNN|date=30 May 2002|accessdate=4 November 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071207043821/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/BUSINESS/05/30/sab.miller/|archivedate=7 December 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Porter was first used in 1721 to describe a dark brown beer popular with the street and river [[Porter (carrier)|porters]] of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camra.org.uk/page.php?id=231|title=Porter and Stout|publisher=CAMRA|accessdate=24 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This same beer later also became known as stout, though the word stout had been used as early as 1677.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0937381446?p=S003#reader-page Amazon Online Reader : Stout (Classic Beer Style Series, 10)].&lt;/ref&gt; The history and development of stout and porter are intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000041.html|title=Porter casts a long shadow on ale history|publisher=beerhunter.com|accessdate=24 February 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100403081327/http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000041.html|archivedate=3 April 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Mild
[[Mild ale]] has a predominantly malty palate. It is usually dark coloured with an [[Alcohol by volume|abv]] of 3% to 3.6%, although there are lighter hued milds as well as stronger examples reaching 6% abv and higher.

;Wheat
[[Wheat beer]] is brewed with a large proportion of wheat although it often also contains a significant proportion of [[malted barley]]. Wheat beers are usually [[top-fermented]] (in Germany they have to be by law).&lt;ref name=&quot;Warner&quot;&gt;Eric Warner, ''German Wheat Beer''. Boulder, CO: Brewers Publications, 1992. ISBN 978-0-937381-34-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The flavour of wheat beers varies considerably, depending upon the specific style.

;Lager
[[Lager]] is the English name for cool fermenting beers of Central European origin. [[Pale lager]]s are the most commonly consumed beers in the world. The name &quot;lager&quot; comes from the German &quot;lagern&quot; for &quot;to store&quot;, as brewers around Bavaria stored beer in cool cellars and caves during the warm summer months. These brewers noticed that the beers continued to ferment, and to also clear of sediment, when stored in cool conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000255.html Beerhunter.com] Michael Jackson, ''BeerHunter'', &quot;The birth of lager&quot;, 1 March 1996. Retrieved 16 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lager yeast is a cool bottom-fermenting yeast (''[[Saccharomyces pastorianus]]'') and typically undergoes primary fermentation at {{convert|7|–|12|C|F}} (the fermentation phase), and then is given a long secondary fermentation at {{convert|0|–|4|C|F}} (the lagering phase). During the secondary stage, the lager clears and mellows. The cooler conditions also inhibit the natural production of [[ester]]s and other byproducts, resulting in a &quot;cleaner&quot;-tasting beer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-09/cshl-bbb090308.php Eurekalert.org] Gavin Sherlock, PhD, EurekAlert, ''Brewing better beer: Scientists determine the genomic origins of lager yeasts'', 10 September 2008. Retrieved 16 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern methods of producing lager were pioneered by Gabriel Sedlmayr the Younger, who perfected dark brown lagers at the [[Spaten Brewery]] in Bavaria, and [[Anton Dreher]], who began brewing a lager (now known as [[Vienna lager]]), probably of amber-red colour, in [[Vienna]] in 1840–1841. With improved modern yeast strains, most lager breweries use only short periods of cold storage, typically 1–3 weeks.

;Lambic
[[Lambic]], a beer of [[Belgian beers|Belgium]], is naturally fermented using wild yeasts, rather than cultivated. Many of these are not strains of brewer's yeast (''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'') and may have significant differences in aroma and sourness. Yeast varieties such as ''[[Brettanomyces bruxellensis]]'' and ''[[Brettanomyces lambicus]]'' are common in lambics. In addition, other organisms such as ''[[Lactobacillus]]'' bacteria produce acids which contribute to the sourness.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, Tim; Pollard, Chris; and Pattyn, Joris; ''Lambicland: Lambikland'', Rev Ed. (Cogan and Mater Ltd, 2004), ISBN 0-9547789-0-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measurement==
{{Main|Beer measurement}}

Beer is measured and assessed by bitterness, by strength and by colour. The perceived [[bitter (taste)|bitterness]] is measured by the International Bitterness Units scale (IBU), defined in co-operation between the [[American Society of Brewing Chemists]] and the [[European Brewery Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europeanbreweryconvention.org/EBCmain/commiteesgroups/index.php|title=The Analysis Committee|accessdate=5 August 2009|author=European Brewery Convention|quote=The EBC Analysis Committee also works closely together with the 'American Society of Brewing Chemists' (ASBC) to establish so-called 'International methods' with world-wide recognition of applicability. A partnership declaration between EBC and ASBC has been signed. The integration of the IOB methods of analysis and EBC methods is nearing completion.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international scale was a development of the European Bitterness Units scale, often abbreviated as EBU, and the bitterness values should be identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lehighvalleyhomebrewers.org/glossary.html|title=Beer and Brewing Glossary|accessdate=5 August 2009|author=Lehigh Valley Homebrewers|year=2007|quote=IBUs (International Bittering Units)&amp;nbsp;– The accepted worldwide standard for measuring bitterness in beer, also known as EBU, based on the estimated alpha acid percentage of the hops used and the length of time they are boiled.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colour===
[[File:Paulaner.jpg|thumb|upright|Paulaner [[dunkel]]&amp;nbsp;– a dark lager]]

Beer colour is determined by the malt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5PVTAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=The+color+of+beer+is+first+of+all+determined+by+the+malt+type.&amp;dq=The+color+of+beer+is+first+of+all+determined+by+the+malt+type.&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;pgis=1 Google Books] Fritz Ullmann, ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'' Vol A-11 pp455, VCH (1985), ISBN 3-527-20103-3&lt;/ref&gt; The most common colour is a pale amber produced from using pale malts. ''Pale lager'' and ''pale ale'' are terms used for beers made from malt dried with [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]. Coke was first used for roasting malt in 1642, but it was not until around 1703 that the term ''pale ale'' was used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ratebeer.com/Beer-News/Article-579.htm British Bitter] &quot;A beer style or a way of life?&quot;, RateBeer (January 2006). Retrieved 30 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martyn Cornell, ''Beer: The Story of the Pint'', Headline (2004), ISBN 0-7553-1165-5&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of sales volume, most of today's beer is based on the pale lager brewed in 1842 in the town of [[Plzeň|Pilsen]] in the present-day [[Czech beer|Czech Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beerhunter.com/documents/19133-000262.html BeerHunter] Michael Jackson, &quot;A Czech-style classic from Belgium&quot;, Beer Hunter Online (7 September 1999). Retrieved 20 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern pale lager is light in colour with a noticeable carbonation (fizzy bubbles) and a typical [[alcohol by volume]] content of around 5%. The [[Pilsner Urquell]], [[Bitburger]], and [[Heineken Pilsener|Heineken]] brands of beer are typical examples of pale lager, as are the American brands [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]], [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors]], and [[Miller Brewing Company|Miller]].

Dark beers are usually brewed from a pale malt or lager malt base with a small proportion of darker malt added to achieve the desired shade. Other colourants—such as caramel—are also widely used to darken beers. Very dark beers, such as [[stout]], use dark or patent malts that have been roasted longer. Some have roasted unmalted barley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gtKOyU9ci1MC&amp;pg=PA320&amp;dq=roasted+malts+color+beer&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U2RMwZBZ6rKkRnpNm-b9zevMVTffg Google Books] Costas Katsigris, Chris Thomas, ''The Bar and Beverage Book'' pp320, John Wiley and Sons (2006), ISBN 0-471-64799-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QDpi_6VnhegC&amp;pg=PA228&amp;dq=roasted+malts+color+beer&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U1-949VOcJUnOwWvO82sgOZ4_dQ5w Google Books] J.

===Strength===
{{See also|Beer measurement#By strength}}

Beer ranges from less than 3% [[alcohol by volume]] (abv) to around 14% abv, though this strength can be increased to around 20% by re-pitching with champagne yeast,&lt;ref name=Mill/&gt; and to 55% abv by the freeze-distilling process.&lt;ref name=End/&gt; The alcohol content of beer varies by local practice or beer style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pattinson|first=Ron|date=6 July 2007|title=European Beer Statistics: Beer production by strength|publisher=European Beer Guide|url=http://www.europeanbeerguide.net/eustats.htm#gravity|accessdate=23 December 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071223173711/http://www.europeanbeerguide.net/eustats.htm|archivedate=23 December 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pale lager]]s that most consumers are familiar with fall in the range of 4–6%, with a typical abv of 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bendbrewfest.com/index.php?page=glossary|title=Fourth Annual Bend Brew Fest|publisher=Bendbrewfest.com|accessdate=28 September 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070929085617/http://bendbrewfest.com/index.php?page=glossary|archivedate=29 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The customary strength of British ales is quite low, with many [[session beer]]s being around 4% abv.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=6 January 2004|title=Beer Facts 2003|publisher=The Brewers of Europe|url=http://www.brewersofeurope.org/docs/publications/beerfacts2003.pdf|accessdate=23 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some beers, such as [[Belgian beer#Table beer|table beer]] are of such low alcohol content (1%–4%) that they are served instead of [[soft drink]]s in some schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Osborn|first=Andrew|date=21 June 2001|title=School dinner?

The alcohol in beer comes primarily from the metabolism of sugars that are produced during fermentation. The quantity of fermentable sugars in the wort and the variety of yeast used to ferment the wort are the primary factors that determine the amount of alcohol in the final beer. Additional fermentable sugars are sometimes added to increase alcohol content, and enzymes are often added to the wort for certain styles of beer (primarily &quot;light&quot; beers) to convert more complex carbohydrates (starches) to fermentable sugars. Alcohol is a by-product of yeast metabolism and is toxic to the yeast; typical brewing yeast cannot survive at alcohol concentrations above 12% by volume. Low temperatures and too little fermentation time decreases the effectiveness of yeasts and consequently decreases the alcohol content.

{{Main|Draught beer|Keg beer|Cask ale}}
[[File:Keg Fonts.jpg|right|thumb|Draught beer keg fonts at the [[Délirium Café]] in Brussels]]
'''Draught beer''' from a pressurised [[keg]] is the most common method of dispensing in bars around the world. A metal keg is pressurised with [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas which drives the beer to the dispensing [[beer tap|tap]] or faucet. Some beers may be served with a nitrogen/carbon dioxide mixture. [[Nitrogen]] produces fine bubbles, resulting in a dense [[Beer head|head]] and a creamy [[mouthfeel]]. Some types of beer can also be found in smaller, disposable kegs called [[beer ball]]s.

In the 1980s, Guinness introduced the [[Widget (beer)|beer widget]], a nitrogen-pressurised ball inside a can which creates a dense, tight head, similar to beer served from a nitrogen system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/question446.htm|title=How does the widget in a beer can work?|publisher=[[HowStuffWorks]]|accessdate=5 November 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071102214918/http://recipes.howstuffworks.com/question446.htm|archivedate= 2 November 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words ''draft'' and ''draught'' can be used as marketing terms to describe canned or [[beer bottle|bottled]] beers containing a beer widget, or which are cold-filtered rather than pasteurised.

[[File:Cask Ales.jpg|thumb|left|A selection of [[cask beer]]s]]
Cask-conditioned ales (or cask ales) are unfiltered and unpasteurised beers. These beers are termed &quot;[[real ale]]&quot; by the [[Campaign for Real Ale|CAMRA]] organisation. Typically, when a cask arrives in a pub, it is placed horizontally on a frame called a &quot;[[stillage]]&quot; which is designed to hold it steady and at the right angle, and then allowed to cool to cellar temperature (typically between {{convert|11|–|13|C|F|disp=or}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cask-marque.co.uk/beer-information/beer-temperature?highlight=YToxOntpOjA7czoxMToidGVtcGVyYXR1cmUiO30=|title=Beer Temperature|publisher=cask-marque.co.uk|accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; before being tapped and vented—a tap is driven through a (usually rubber) bung at the bottom of one end, and a hard [[spile]] or other implement is used to open a hole in the side of the cask, which is now uppermost. The act of stillaging and then venting a beer in this manner typically disturbs all the sediment, so it must be left for a suitable period to &quot;drop&quot; (clear) again, as well as to fully condition—this period can take anywhere from several hours to several days. At this point the beer is ready to sell, either being pulled through a beer line with a hand pump, or simply being &quot;gravity-fed&quot; directly into the glass.

Most beers are cleared of yeast by [[filtered beer|filtering]] when packaged in bottles and cans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-FviAgcmo90C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=beer+classification+ale+lager&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U0GLvHLLvTVL_knmgkSWkPt3iz_eA#PPA58,M1 Google books] Charles W.

Retrieved 29 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually recommended that the beer be poured slowly, leaving any yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle. However, some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast; this practice is customary with [[wheat beer]]s. Typically, when serving a hefeweizen wheat beer, 90% of the contents are poured, and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it into the glass. Alternatively, the bottle may be inverted prior to opening. Glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned beers.

Many beers are sold in cans, though there is considerable variation in the proportion between different countries. In Sweden in 2001, 63.9% of beer was sold in cans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Beer Statistics—beer sales by package type|publisher=European Beer Guide|url=http://www.europeanbeerguide.net/eustats.htm#package|accessdate=5 April 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070426040130/http://www.europeanbeerguide.net/eustats.htm|archivedate=26 April 2007 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; People either drink from the can or pour the beer into a glass.

===Temperature===
[[File:Edouard Manet 006.jpg|upright|thumb|right|[[Édouard Manet]]'s ''The Waitress'' showing a woman serving beer]]
The temperature of a beer has an influence on a drinker's experience; warmer temperatures reveal the range of flavours in a beer but cooler temperatures are more refreshing. Most drinkers prefer [[pale lager]] to be served chilled, a low- or medium-strength [[pale ale]] to be served cool, while a strong [[barley wine]] or [[imperial stout]] to be served at room temperature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realbeer.com/library/beerbreak/archives/beerbreak20000921.php RealBeer] ''Beyond the coldest beer in town'', 21 September 2000. Retrieved 11 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beer writer [[Michael Jackson (writer)|Michael Jackson]] proposed a five-level scale for serving temperatures: well chilled ({{convert|7|°C|°F|abbr=on|disp=or}}) for &quot;light&quot; beers (pale lagers); chilled ({{convert|8|°C|°F|abbr=on|disp=or}}) for [[Berliner Weisse]] and other wheat beers; lightly chilled ({{convert|9|°C|°F|abbr=on|disp=or}}) for all dark lagers, [[altbier]] and German wheat beers; cellar temperature ({{convert|13|°C|°F|abbr=on|disp=or}}) for regular British [[ale]], [[stout]] and most [[Belgian beer|Belgian specialities]]; and room temperature ({{convert|15.5|°C|°F|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) for strong dark ales (especially [[trappist beer]]) and [[barley wine]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Jackson, ''Michael Jackson's Beer Companion'', Courage Books; 2 edition (27 February 2000), ISBN 0-7624-0772-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Drinking chilled beer began with the development of artificial [[refrigeration]] and by the 1870s, was spread in those countries that concentrated on brewing pale lager.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BuzNzm-x0l8C&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=history+of+lager+refrigeration&amp;source=web&amp;ots=zuaFlbk79s&amp;sig=aMrrvuq_XFnoXl8VjnOHBVIJtbY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result Google Books] Jack S.

===Vessels===
{{Main|Beer glassware}}
Beer is consumed out of a variety of vessels, such as a glass, a [[beer stein]], a mug, a [[pewter]] [[tankard]], a beer bottle or a can. The shape of the glass from which beer is consumed can influence the perception of the beer and can define and accent the character of the style.&lt;ref&gt;F. G. Priest, Graham G. Stewart, ''Handbook of Brewing'' (2006), 48&lt;/ref&gt; Breweries offer branded glassware intended only for their own beers as a marketing promotion, as this increases sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepublican.com/story.asp?storycode=64595|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110724020628/http://www.thepublican.com/story.asp?storycode=64595|archivedate=24 July 2011|title=How Miller Brands partners with licensees to drive sales|publisher=thepublican.com|accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pouring process has an influence on a beer's presentation. The rate of flow from the [[beer tap|tap]] or other serving vessel, tilt of the glass, and position of the pour (in the centre or down the side) into the glass all influence the end result, such as the size and longevity of the head, lacing (the pattern left by the head as it moves down the glass as the beer is drunk), and the release of [[carbonation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xnLeJAPYzGkC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=pouring+beer&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U2vCrDBPoQzAIFMN2gjtxKYYQZW3Q Google Books] Ray Foley, Heather Dismore, ''Running a Bar For Dummies'' pp. 211–212, For Dummies (2007), ISBN 0-470-04919-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[beer tower]] is a beer dispensing device usually found in bars and pub that consists of a cylinder attached to a beer cooling device at the bottom. Beer is dispensed from the beer tower into a drinking vessel.

==Beer and society==

In most societies, beer is the most popular alcoholic beverage. Various social traditions and activities are associated with beer drinking, such as playing cards, darts, or other pub games; attending [[beer festival]]s; visiting a [[pub crawl|series of pubs]] in one evening; joining an organisation such as [[Campaign for Real Ale|CAMRA]]; visiting breweries; beer-oriented tourism; or [[rating beer]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Leslie Dunkling]] &amp; Michael Jackson, ''The Guinness Drinking Companion'', Lyons Press (2003), ISBN 1-58574-617-7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Drinking game]]s, such as [[beer pong]], are also popular.&lt;ref&gt;''Best Drinking Game Book Ever'', Carlton Books (28 October 2002), ISBN 1-85868-560-5&lt;/ref&gt; A relatively new profession is that of the [[beer sommelier]], who informs restaurant patrons about beers and food pairings.

A study published in the ''Neuropsychopharmacology'' journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke [[dopamine]] activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron emission tomography scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports drink, the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beer on the brain: how taste alone can drive men to drink|url=http://theconversation.com/beer-on-the-brain-how-taste-alone-can-drive-men-to-drink-13509?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Latest+from+The+Conversation+for+17+April+2013&amp;utm_content=Latest+from+The+Conversation+for+17+April+2013+CID_1721ca212231ef8b8a4f05e3f61357f9&amp;utm_source=campaign_monitor&amp;utm_term=Beer%20on%20the%20brain%20how%20taste%20alone%20can%20drive%20men%20to%20drink|work=The Conversation|publisher=The Conversation Media Group|accessdate=18 April 2013|author=Carley Tonoli|author2=Liz Minchin|date=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brewer's yeast]] is known to be a rich source of nutrients; therefore, as expected, beer can contain significant amounts of nutrients, including [[magnesium]], [[selenium]], [[potassium]], [[phosphorus]], [[biotin]], [[chromium]] and [[B vitamins]].

It is considered that overeating and lack of muscle tone is the main cause of a [[beer belly]], rather than beer consumption. A recent study, however, found a link between [[binge drinking]] and a beer belly.

Around the world, there are a number of traditional and ancient starch-based beverages classed as beer. In Africa, there are various ethnic beers made from [[sorghum]] or [[millet]], such as [[Oshikundu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epress.lib.uts.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2100/268/5/05Section3toBib.pdf|title=Recuperation|format=PDF|accessdate=28 September 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081002104412/http://epress.lib.uts.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2100/268/5/05Section3toBib.pdf|archivedate=2 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Namibia and [[Tella]] in Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ethnomed.org/ethnomed/cultures/ethiop/ethiop_foods.html|title=EthnoMed: Traditional Foods of the Central Ethiopian Highlands|publisher=Ethnomed.org|accessdate=28 September 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080411224116/http://ethnomed.org/ethnomed/cultures/ethiop/ethiop_foods.html|archivedate=11 April 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kyrgyzstan]] also has a beer made from millet; it is a low alcohol, somewhat porridge-like drink called &quot;Bozo&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Surina|first1=Asele|last2=Mack|first2=Glenn Randall|title=Food culture in Russia and Central Asia|url=http://books.google.com/?id=j7MTx_zcIR0C&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=Kyrgyzstan+bozo|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=0-313-32773-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bhutan]], Nepal, [[Tibet]] and [[Sikkim]] also use millet in [[Chhaang]], a popular semi-fermented rice/millet drink in the eastern [[Himalaya]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trek2himalaya.com/nepal/research_culture_tourism.php|title=Research &amp;amp; Culture, Kathmandu rich in Culture, Machchhendranath Temple, Akash Bhairav Temple, Hanumandhoka Durbar Square, Temple of Kumari Ghar, Jaishi Dewal, Martyr's Memorial (Sahid) Gate, Singha Durbar|publisher=Trek2himalaya.com|accessdate=28 September 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081013021707/http://www.trek2himalaya.com/nepal/research_culture_tourism.php|archivedate=13 October 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further east in China are found [[Huangjiu]] and [[Choujiu]]—traditional rice-based beverages related to beer.

The [[Andes]] in South America has [[Chicha]], made from germinated maize (corn); while the [[indigenous peoples in Brazil]] have [[Cauim]], a traditional beverage made since pre-Columbian times by chewing [[manioc]] so that an enzyme ([[amylase]]) present in human saliva can break down the starch into fermentable sugars;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5GPthV9MyccC&amp;pg=PA143&amp;lpg=PA143&amp;dq=Cauim+chewed&amp;source=web&amp;ots=GxROXeoASu&amp;sig=8FN4t_HrDDVYqZ8_g3A2WJJVeQo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ct=result Books.google.co.uk], Lewin Louis and Louis Levin, ''Phantastica: A Classic Survey on the Use and Abuse of Mind-Altering Plants'', Inner Traditions / Bear &amp; Company (1998), ISBN 0-89281-783-6&lt;/ref&gt; this is similar to Masato in [[Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Anthropological Review|url=http://books.google.com/?id=3tA0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=Masato+yuca|year=1863|publisher=Trübner|author=Anthropological Society of London|isbn=0-559-56998-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some beers which are made from bread, which is linked to the earliest forms of beer, are [[Sahti]] in Finland, [[Kvass]] in Russia and [[Ukraine]], and [[Bouza]] in Sudan.

== Chemistry ==
Beer contains the phenolic acids [[4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid]], [[vanillic acid]], [[caffeic acid]], [[syringic acid]], [[p-coumaric acid]], [[ferulic acid]] and [[sinapic acid]]. [[Alkaline hydrolysis]] experiments show that the most of the phenolic acids are present as bound forms and only a small portion can be detected as free compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0308-8146(03)00257-7|title=Determination of free and bound phenolic acids in beer|year=2004|last1=Nardini|first1=M|journal=Food Chemistry|volume=84|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hops, and beer made with it, contain [[8-prenylnaringenin]] which is a potent [[phytoestrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=14744951|year=2004|last1=Nikolic|first1=D|last2=Li|first2=Y|last3=Chadwick|first3=LR|last4=Grubjesic|first4=S|last5=Schwab|first5=P|last6=Metz|first6=P|last7=Van Breemen|first7=RB|title=Metabolism of 8-prenylnaringenin, a potent phytoestrogen from hops (Humulus lupulus), by human liver microsomes|volume=32|issue=2|pages=272–9|doi=10.1124/dmd.32.2.272|journal=Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hop also contains [[myrcene]], [[humulene]], [[xanthohumol]], [[isoxanthohumol]], [[myrcenol]], [[linalool]], tannins and [[resin]]. The alcohol [[2-Methyl-2-butanol|2M2B]] is a component of hops brewing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herb2K&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herbs2000.com/herbs/herbs_hops.htm|title=Hops: Humulus lupulus|accessdate=14 February 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barley, in the form of malt, brings the condensed tannins [[prodelphinidin B3|prodelphinidins B3]], [[Prodelphinidin B9|B9]] and [[Prodelphinidin C2|C2]].

[[Tryptophol]], [[tyrosol]] and [[phenylethanol]] are aromatic higher alcohols found in beer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/j.2050-0416.1973.tb03541.x|title=Tryptophol, Tyrosol and Phenylethanol-The Aromatic Higher Alcohols in Beer|year=1973|last1=Szlavko|first1=Clara M.|journal=Journal of the Institute of Brewing|volume=79|issue=4|page=283}}&lt;/ref&gt; as secondary products of [[alcoholic fermentation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite PMID|4954284}} (Article in French)&lt;/ref&gt; (products also known as [[congener (alcohol)|congeners]]) by ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''.
