'''Apollo 17''' was the final mission of the [[United States]]' [[Apollo program]], the enterprise&lt;!--Meriam-Webster: &quot;a project or activity that involves many people and that is often difficult&quot;--&gt; that landed the first humans on the [[Moon]]. Launched at 12:33&amp;nbsp;am Eastern Standard Time (EST) on December 7, 1972, with a three-member crew consisting of Commander [[Eugene Cernan]], [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Module]] Pilot [[Ronald Evans (astronaut)|Ronald Evans]], and [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] Pilot [[Harrison Schmitt]], It was the last use of Apollo hardware for its original mission. After Apollo 17, extra [[Apollo (spacecraft)|Apollo spacecraft]] were used in the [[Skylab]] and [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project]] programs.

Apollo 17 was the first night launch of a U.S. human spaceflight and the final crewed launch of a [[Saturn V]] rocket. It was a &quot;[[List of Apollo mission types|J-type mission]],&quot; which included a three-day lunar surface stay, extended scientific capability, and the third [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]] (LRV). While Evans remained in [[lunar orbit]] above in the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] (CSM), Cernan and Schmitt spent just over three days on the lunar surface in the [[Taurus–Littrow (lunar valley)|Taurus-Littrow valley]], conducting three periods of [[extra-vehicular activity]], or moonwalks, during which they collected lunar samples and deployed [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package|scientific instruments]]. Cernan, Evans, and Schmitt returned to Earth on December 19 after an approximately 12-day mission.&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;

The decision to land in the Taurus-Littrow valley was made with the primary objectives for Apollo 17 in mind: to sample [[Lunar highlands|lunar highland]] material older than the impact that formed [[Mare Imbrium]] and investigating the possibility of relatively young [[Volcano|volcanic activity]] in the same vicinity. Taurus-Littrow was selected with the prospects of finding highland material in the valley's north and south walls and the possibility that several craters in the valley surrounded by dark material could be linked to volcanic activity.&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt;

Apollo 17 also broke several records set by previous flights, including the longest manned lunar landing flight; the longest total lunar surface extravehicular activities; the largest lunar sample return, and the longest time in lunar orbit.&lt;ref name=records&gt;{{cite web|title=December 11, 1972 – Longest lunar stay by humans|url=http://todayinspacehistory.wordpress.com/2007/12/11/december-11-1972-longest-lunar-stay-by-humans/|work=Today in Space History|accessdate=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=evarecord&gt;{{cite web|title=Extravehicular Activity|url=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_18-30_Extravehicular_Activity.htm|publisher=NASA|accessdate=25 August 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041118103553/http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_18-30_Extravehicular_Activity.htm|archivedate=18 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo 17 remains the most recent manned [[Moon landing]] and also the last time humans have travelled beyond [[low Earth orbit]].&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;&lt;ref name=alsjoverview&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo 17 Mission Overview|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17ov.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eugene Cernan, Ronald Evans, and former [[North American X-15|X-15]] pilot [[Joe Engle]] were assigned to the backup crew of [[Apollo 14]].&lt;ref name=a17pre&gt;{{cite web|title=A Running Start – Apollo 17 up to Powered Descent Initiation|url=http://next.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.prepdi.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engle flew sixteen X-15 flights, three of which exceeded the {{convert|50|mi|km|abbr=on}} border of space.&lt;ref name=englebio&gt;{{cite web|title=Astronaut Bio: Joe Henry Engle|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/engle-jh.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the rotation pattern that a backup crew would fly as the prime crew three missions later, Cernan, Evans, and Engle would have flown Apollo 17. Harrison Schmitt served on the backup crew of [[Apollo 15]] and, following the crew rotation cycle, was slated to fly as Lunar Module Pilot on Apollo 18. However, [[Canceled Apollo missions|Apollo 18 was cancelled]] in September 1970. Following this decision, the scientific community pressured [[NASA]] to assign a [[geologist]] to an Apollo landing, as opposed to a pilot trained in geology. In light of this pressure, Harrison Schmitt, a professional geologist, was assigned the Lunar Module Pilot position on Apollo 17.&lt;ref name=a17pre/&gt;

Subsequent to the decision to assign Schmitt to Apollo 17, there remained the question of which crew (the full backup crew of Apollo 15, [[Richard F. Gordon, Jr.|Dick Gordon]], [[Vance D. Brand|Vance Brand]], and Schmitt, or the backup crew of Apollo 14) would become prime crew of the mission. NASA Director of Flight Crew Operations [[Deke Slayton]] ultimately assigned the backup crew of Apollo 14 (Cernan and Evans), along with Schmitt, to the prime crew of Apollo 17.&lt;ref name=a17pre/&gt;

The Apollo 15 prime crew received the backup assignment since this was to be the last lunar mission and the backup crew would not rotate to another mission. However, when the [[Apollo 15 postage stamp incident]] became public in early 1972 the crew was reprimanded by NASA and the [[United States Air Force]] (they were active duty officers). Director of Flight Crew Operations Deke Slayton removed them from flight status and replaced them with Young and Duke from the [[Apollo 16]] prime crew and Roosa from the Apollo 14 prime and Apollo 16 backup crews.&lt;ref name=15dropped&gt;{{cite news|title=2 Astronauts Quitting Jobs And Military|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=plwxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=6wEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7112,4977778&amp;dq=roosa+apollo+17&amp;hl=en|accessdate=26 August 2011|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[Toledo Blade]]|date=24 May 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Slayton &amp; Cassutt 1994|Slayton &amp; Cassutt 1994]], p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mission insignia ===

The insignia's most prominent feature is an image of the Greek sun god [[Apollo]] backdropped by a rendering of an [[Bald eagle|American eagle]], the red bars on the eagle mirroring those on the [[flag of the United States]]. Three white stars above the red bars represent the three crewmen of the mission. The background includes the Moon, the planet [[Saturn]] and a galaxy or nebula. The wing of the eagle partially overlays the Moon, suggesting man's established presence there. The gaze of Apollo and the direction of the eagle's motion embody man's intention to explore further destinations in space.&lt;ref name=insignia&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo Mission Insignias|url=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_18-18_Mission_Insignias.htm|publisher=NASA|accessdate=25 August 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110721234247/http://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_18-18_Mission_Insignias.htm| archivedate= 21 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The patch includes, along with the colors of the U.S. flag (red, white, and blue), the color gold, representative of a &quot;golden age&quot; of spaceflight that was to begin with Apollo 17. The image of Apollo in the mission insignia is a rendering of the ''[[Apollo Belvedere]]'' sculpture. The insignia was designed by [[Robert McCall (artist)|Robert McCall]], with input from the crew.&lt;ref name=insignia/&gt;

== Planning and training ==
[[File:Apollo 17 - Gene Cernan training in Sudbury.jpg|thumb|right|Gene Cernan participates in geology training in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury, Ontario]] in May 1972]]
Like Apollo 15 and Apollo 16, Apollo 17 was slated to be a &quot;[[List of Apollo mission types|J-mission]],&quot; an Apollo mission type that featured lunar surface stays of three days, higher scientific capability, and the usage of the Lunar Roving Vehicle. Since Apollo 17 was to be the final lunar landing of the Apollo program, high-priority landing sites that had not been visited previously were given consideration for potential exploration. A landing in the crater [[Copernicus (lunar crater)|Copernicus]] was considered, but was ultimately rejected because [[Apollo 12]] had already obtained samples from that impact, and three other Apollo expeditions had already visited the vicinity of Mare Imbrium. A landing in the lunar highlands near the crater [[Tycho (crater)|Tycho]] was also considered, but was rejected because of the rough terrain found there and a landing on the [[Far side of the Moon|lunar far side]] in the crater [[Tsiolkovskiy (crater)|Tsiolkovskiy]] was rejected due to technical considerations and the operational costs of maintaining communication during surface operations. A landing in a region southwest of [[Mare Crisium]] was also considered, but rejected on the grounds that a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spacecraft could easily access the site; [[Luna 20]] eventually did so shortly after the Apollo 17 site selection was made.&lt;ref name=lpi&gt;{{cite web|title=Landing Site Overview|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/missions/apollo/apollo_17/landing_site/|work=Apollo 17 Mission|publisher=[[Lunar and Planetary Institute]]|accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the elimination of several sites, three sites made the final consideration for Apollo 17: [[Alphonsus (crater)|Alphonsus crater]], [[Gassendi (crater)|Gassendi crater]], and the Taurus-Littrow valley. In making the final landing site decision, mission planners took into consideration the primary objectives for Apollo 17: obtaining old highlands material from a substantial distance from Mare Imbrium, sampling material from young volcanic activity (i.e., less than three billion years), and having minimal ground overlap with the orbital ground tracks of Apollo 15 and Apollo 16 to maximize the amount of new data obtained.&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt;

The Taurus-Littrow site was selected with the prediction that the crew would be able to obtain samples of old highland material from the remnants of a landslide event that occurred on the south wall of the valley and the possibility of relatively young, explosive volcanic activity in the area. Although the valley is similar to the [[Hadley–Apennine (Moon)|landing site of Apollo 15]] in that it is on the border of a [[lunar mare]], the advantages of Taurus-Littrow were believed to outweigh the drawbacks, thus leading to its selection as the Apollo 17 landing site.&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt;

Apollo 17 was the only lunar landing mission to carry the Traverse [[Gravimeter]] Experiment (TGE), an experiment built by [[Charles Stark Draper Laboratory|Draper Laboratory]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] designed to provide relative gravity measurements throughout the landing site at various locations during the mission's moonwalks. Scientists would then use this data to gather information about the geological substructure of the landing site and the surrounding vicinity.&lt;ref name=alsjtge&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo 17 Traverse Gravimeter Experiment|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17-TGE.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with previous lunar landings, the Apollo 17 astronauts underwent an extensive training program that included training to collect samples on the surface, usage of the [[Apollo/Skylab A7L|spacesuits]], navigation in the Lunar Roving Vehicle, field geology training, survival training, [[Splashdown (spacecraft landing)|splashdown]] and recovery training, and equipment training.&lt;ref name=training&gt;{{cite news|last=Mason|first=Betsy|title=The Incredible Things NASA Did to Train Apollo Astronauts|url=http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/07/moon-landing-gallery/?pid=1688&amp;viewall=true|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired Science]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications]] |accessdate=23 August 2011|date=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission hardware and experiments ==

=== Traverse Gravimeter ===

Apollo 17 was the only Apollo lunar landing mission to carry the Traverse Gravimeter Experiment. As gravimeters have proven to be useful in the geologic investigation of the Earth, the objective of this experiment was to determine the feasibility of using the same techniques on the Moon to learn about its internal structure. The gravimeter was used to obtain readings at the landing site in the immediate vicinity of the Lunar Module (LM), as well as various locations on the mission's traverse routes. The TGE was carried on the Lunar Roving Vehicle; measurements were taken by the astronauts while the LRV was not in motion or after the gravimeter was placed on the surface.&lt;ref name=presskit&gt;{{cite web |url=https://mira.hq.nasa.gov/history/ws/hdmshrc/all/main/DDD/17980.PDF |title=Apollo 17 Press Kit |date=26 November 1972 |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, D.C. |format=PDF |id=72-220K |accessdate=26 August 2011 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110721080816/https://mira.hq.nasa.gov/history/ws/hdmshrc/all/main/DDD/17980.PDF |archivedate=21 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of twenty-six measurements were taken with the TGE during the mission's three moonwalks, with productive results. As part of the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]] (ALSEP), the astronauts also deployed the Lunar Surface Gravimeter, a similar experiment, which ultimately failed to function properly.&lt;ref name=alsjtge/&gt;

=== Scientific Instrument Module ===

[[File:Apollo 17 CSM SIM bay.jpg|thumb|right|Apollo 17 SIM bay on the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Service Module (SM)|Service Module]], seen from the Lunar Module in orbit around the Moon]]

Sector one of the Apollo 17 [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Service Module (SM)|Service Module]] (SM) contained the Scientific Instrument Module (SIM) bay. The SIM bay housed three experiments for use in lunar orbit: a lunar sounder, an [[infrared]] scanning [[radiometer]], and a [[Ultraviolet|far-ultraviolet]] spectrometer. A mapping camera, panoramic camera, and a [[Lidar|laser altimeter]] were also included in the SIM bay.&lt;ref name=presskit/&gt;

The lunar sounder beamed [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] impulses toward the lunar surface, which were designed with the objective of obtaining data to assist in developing a geological model of the interior of the Moon to an approximate depth of {{convert|1.3|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=presskit/&gt;

The Infrared Scanning Radiometer was designed with the objective of generating a temperature map of the lunar surface to aid in locating surface features such as rock fields, structural differences in the [[Internal structure of the Moon|lunar crust]], and volcanic activity.&lt;ref name=presskit/&gt;

The Far-Ultraviolet Spectrometer was to be used to obtain data pertaining to the composition, density, and constituency of the [[Atmosphere of the Moon|lunar atmosphere]]. The spectrometer was also designed to detect far-UV radiation emitted by the [[Sun]] that has been reflected off the lunar surface.&lt;ref name=presskit/&gt;

The Laser Altimeter was designed with the intention of measuring the altitude of the spacecraft above the lunar surface within approximately two meters (6.5&amp;nbsp;feet), and providing altitude information to the panoramic and mapping cameras.&lt;ref name=presskit/&gt;

=== Light flash phenomenon ===
{{main|Cosmic ray visual phenomena}}

Throughout the Apollo lunar missions, the crew members observed light flashes that penetrated closed eyelids. These flashes, described as &quot;streaks&quot; or &quot;specks&quot; of light, were usually observed by astronauts while the spacecraft was darkened during a sleep period. These flashes, while not observed on the lunar surface, would average about two per minute and were observed by the crew members during the trip out to the Moon, back to Earth, and in lunar orbit.&lt;ref name=presskit/&gt;

The Apollo 17 crew conducted an experiment, also conducted on Apollo 16, with the objective of linking these light flashes with [[cosmic ray]]s. As part of an experiment conducted by NASA and the [[University of Houston]], one astronaut wore a device that recorded the time, strength, and path of high-energy atomic particles that penetrated the device. Analysis of the results concluded that the evidence supported the hypothesis that the flashes occurred when charged particles travelled through the [[retina]] in the eye.&lt;ref name=presskit/&gt;&lt;ref name=lightflash&gt;{{cite book |last1=Osborne |first1=W.

=== Surface Electrical Properties Experiment ===

[[File:Apollo 17 rover at final resting site.jpg|thumb|right|Apollo 17 lunar rover at its final resting place on the Moon. The Surface Electrical Properties (SEP) receiver is the antenna on the right-rear of the vehicle]]

Apollo 17 was the only lunar surface expedition to include the Surface Electrical Properties (SEP) experiment. The experiment included two major components: a transmitting antenna deployed near the Lunar Module and a receiving antenna located on the Lunar Roving Vehicle. At different stops during the mission's traverses, electrical signals traveled from the transmitting device, through the ground, and received at the LRV. The electrical properties of the [[lunar soil]] could be determined by comparison of the transmitted and received electrical signals. The results of this experiment, which are consistent with [[Moon rock|lunar rock]] composition, show that the top {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the Moon are extremely dry.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

=== Lunar Roving Vehicle ===

Apollo 17 was the third mission (the others being Apollo 15 and Apollo 16) to make use of a Lunar Roving Vehicle. The LRV, in addition to being used by the astronauts for transport from station to station on the mission's three moonwalks, was used to transport the astronauts' tools, communications equipment, and samples.&lt;ref name=presskit/&gt; The Apollo 17 LRV was also used to carry experiments unique to the mission, such as the Traverse Gravimeter and Surface Electrical Properties experiment.&lt;ref name=alsjtge/&gt;&lt;ref name=sep&gt;{{cite web|title=Surface Electrical Properties|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/lunar/missions/apollo/apollo_17/experiments/sep/|work=Apollo 17 Science Experiments|publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute|accessdate=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Apollo 17 LRV traveled a cumulative distance of approximately {{convert|35.9|km|mi|abbr=on}} in a total drive time of about four hours and twenty-six minutes; the greatest distance Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt traveled from the Lunar Module was about {{convert|7.6|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=lunarrover&gt;{{cite web|title=The Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo_lrv.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=26 August 2011&lt;!-- | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110715222253/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo_lrv.html| archivedate= 15 July 2011 |deadurl= no --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biological cosmic ray experiment ===
Apollo 17 included a biological cosmic ray experiment (BIOCORE), carrying mice that had been implanted with radiation monitors to see whether they suffered damage from cosmic rays.&lt;ref name=biocoreSPP330&gt;{{cite book |author = Bailey. O.T., et al. |year=1973  |chapter=26. Biocore Experiment |title=Apollo 17 Preliminary Science Report (NASA SPP-330)  |url=http://the-moon.wikispaces.com/NASA+SP-330 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five pocket mice (''[[Perognathus longimembris]]'') were implanted with radiation monitors under their scalps and flown on the mission.  The species was chosen because it was well-documented, small, easy to maintain in an isolated state (not requiring drinking water for the duration of the mission and with highly concentrated waste), and for its ability to withstand environmental stress.  Four of the five mice survived the flight; the cause of death of the fifth mouse was not determined.&lt;ref name=biocoreSPP330/&gt;

The study found [[lesion]]s in the scalp itself and liver.  The scalp lesions and liver lesions appeared to be unrelated to one another, and were not thought to be the result of cosmic rays.  No damage was found in the mice's retinas or viscera.&lt;ref name=biocoreSPP330/&gt; At the time of the publication of the Apollo 17 Preliminary Science Report, the mouse brains had not yet been examined.&lt;ref name=biocoreSPP330/&gt; However, subsequent studies showed no significant effect on the brains.&lt;ref name=bioCoreSP368&gt;{{cite book |last1=Haymaker |first1=Webb  |last2=Look |first2=Bonne C. |last3=Benton |first3=Eugene V.  |last4=Simmonds |first4=Richard C.  |date=January 1, 1975 |chapter=The Apollo 17 Pocket Mouse Experiment (Biocore) |chapterurl=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-368/s4ch4.htm  |editor1-last=Johnston  |editor1-first=Richard S. |editor2-last=Berry  |editor2-first=Charles A. |editor3-last=Dietlein |editor3-first=Lawrence F.  |title=SP-368 Biomedical Results of Apollo (SP-368) |url=http://history.nasa.gov/SP-368/sp368.htm  |publisher=Lyndon B.

=== Launch and outbound trip ===

[[File:Apollo 17 liftoff.jpg|thumb|right|Apollo 17 launches on December 7, 1972]]

Apollo 17 was launched at 12:33&amp;nbsp;am [[Eastern time|EST]] on December 7, 1972, from launch pad 39-A at the [[Kennedy Space Center]]. It was the last manned Saturn V launch and the only night launch. The launch was delayed by two hours and forty minutes due to an automatic cutoff in the launch sequencer at the T-30 second mark in the countdown. The issue was quickly determined to be a minor technical error. The clock was reset and held at the T-22 minute mark while technicians worked around the malfunction in order to continue with the launch. This pause was the only launch delay in the Apollo program caused by this type of hardware failure. The count resumed and a normal low Earth orbit was achieved.&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;&lt;ref name=launchops&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo 17 Launch Operations|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/ch23-7.html|publisher=NASA|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 500,000 people were estimated to have observed the launch in the immediate vicinity of Kennedy Space Center, despite the early morning hour. The launch was visible as far away as {{convert|800|km|mi|abbr=on}}; observers in [[Miami|Miami, Florida]], saw a &quot;red streak&quot; crossing the northern sky.&lt;ref name=launchops/&gt;

At 3:46&amp;nbsp;am EST, the [[S-IVB]] third stage was [[Trans-lunar injection|re-ignited]] to propel the spacecraft towards the Moon.&lt;ref name=astronautix&gt;{{cite web|last=Wade|first=Mark|title=Apollo 17|url=http://www.astronautix.com/flights/apollo17.htm|publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At approximately 2:47&amp;nbsp;pm EST on December 10, the [[Service Propulsion System]] engine on the Command/Service Module ignited to slow down the CSM/Lunar Module stack into lunar orbit. Following orbit insertion and orbital stabilization, the crew began preparations for landing in the Taurus-Littrow valley.&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;

=== Moon Landing ===

After separating from the Command/Service Module, the Lunar Module ''Challenger'' and its crew of two, Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt, adjusted their orbit and began preparations for the descent to Taurus-Littrow. While Cernan and Schmitt prepared for landing, Command Module Pilot Ron Evans remained in orbit to take observations, perform experiments and await the return of his crew-mates a few days later.&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;&lt;ref name=alsjland&gt;{{cite web|title=Landing at Taurus-Littrow|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.landing.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after completing their preparations for landing, Cernan and Schmitt began their descent to the Taurus-Littrow valley on the lunar surface. Several minutes after the descent phase was initiated, the Lunar Module pitched over, giving the crew their first look at the landing site during the descent phase and allowing Cernan to guide the spacecraft to a desirable landing target while Schmitt provided data from the flight computer essential for landing. The LM touched down on the lunar surface at 2:55&amp;nbsp;pm EST on December 11. Shortly thereafter, the two astronauts began re-configuring the LM for their stay on the surface and began preparations for the first moonwalk of the mission, or EVA-1.&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;&lt;ref name=alsjland/&gt;

=== Lunar surface ===

[[File:Apollo 17 Cernan on moon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eugene Cernan]] on the lunar surface, December 13, 1972]]

The first moonwalk ([[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]]) of the mission began approximately four hours after landing, at about 6:55&amp;nbsp;pm on December 11. The first task of the first lunar excursion was to offload the Lunar Roving Vehicle and other equipment from the Lunar Module. While working near the rover, a fender was accidentally broken off when Gene Cernan brushed up against it, his hammer getting caught under the right-rear fender, breaking off the rear extension. The same incident had also occurred on Apollo 16 as Commander [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] maneuvered around the rover. Although this was not a mission-critical issue, the loss of the fender caused Cernan and Schmitt to be covered with dust thrown up when the rover was in motion.&lt;ref name=&quot;brokenfender&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=ALSEP Off-load|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.alsepoff.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew used [[duct tape]] to fix the problem, but the dust picked up on the surface prevented the tape from sticking for the length of the exploration.&lt;ref name=&quot;fenderfix&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/21apr_ducttape/ |title=Moondust and Duct Tape |last=Phillips |first=Tony |date=April 21, 2008 |website=Science@NASA |publisher=NASA |accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crew then deployed the [[Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package]] (ALSEP) west of the immediate landing site. After completing this, Cernan and Schmitt departed on the first geologic traverse of the mission towards [[Steno-Apollo (crater)|Steno]] crater to the south of the landing site, during which they gathered {{convert|14|kg|lbs}} of samples; took seven gravimeter measurements; and deployed two explosive packages, which were later detonated remotely to test [[geophone]]s that had been placed by the astronauts and [[seismometer]]s that had been placed on previous Apollo missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brzostowski |first1=Matthew |last2=Brzostowski |first2=Adam |date=April 2009 |title=Archiving the Apollo active seismic data |url=http://tle.geoscienceworld.org/content/28/4/414.abstract |journal=[[Society of Exploration Geophysicists#Journals, books, and newsletters|The Leading Edge]] |location=Tulsa, OK |publisher=[[Society of Exploration Geophysicists]] |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=414–416 |doi=10.1190/1.3112756 |issn=1070-485X |accessdate=12 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EVA ended after seven hours and twelve minutes.&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;&lt;ref name=alsjeva1&gt;{{cite web|title=The First EVA|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=22 August 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110716040118/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.html| archivedate= 16 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 12, at 6:28&amp;nbsp;pm EST, Cernan and Schmitt began their second lunar excursion. One of the first tasks of the EVA was repairing the right-rear fender on the LRV, the rearward extension of which had been broken off the previous day. The pair did this by taping together four cronopaque maps with duct tape and clamping the replacement fender extension to the fender, thus providing a means of preventing dust from raining down upon them while in motion.&lt;ref name=&quot;brokenfender&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fenderfix&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=eva2prep&gt;{{cite web|title=Preparations for EVA-2|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.eva2prep.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this EVA, the pair sampled several different types of geologic deposits found in the valley, including the avalanche at the base of the South Massif, orange-colored soil at [[Shorty (crater)|Shorty crater]], and [[ejecta]] of [[Camelot (crater)|Camelot crater]]. The crew completed this moonwalk after seven hours and thirty-seven minutes. They collected {{convert|34|kg|lbs}} of samples, deployed three more explosive packages and took seven gravimeter measurements.&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;

The third moonwalk, the last of the Apollo program, began at 5:26&amp;nbsp;pm EST on December 13. During this excursion, the crew collected {{convert|66|kg|lbs}} of lunar samples and took nine gravimeter measurements. They drove the rover to the north and east of the landing site and explored the base of the North Massif, the Sculptured Hills, and the unusual crater [[Van Serg (crater)|Van Serg]].  Before ending the moonwalk, the crew collected a rock, a [[breccia]], and dedicated it to several different nations which were represented in [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center#Houston (1965–present)|Mission Control Center]] in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]], at the time. A plaque located on the Lunar Module, commemorating the achievements made during the Apollo program, was then unveiled. Before reentering the LM for the final time, Gene Cernan expressed his thoughts:&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;

{{quote|text=...I'm on the surface; and, as I take man's last step from the surface, back home for some time to come - but we believe not too long into the future - I'd like to just [say] what I believe history will record. That America's challenge of today has forged man's destiny of tomorrow. And, as we leave the Moon at Taurus-Littrow, we leave as we came and, God willing, as we shall return, with peace and hope for all mankind. &quot;Godspeed the crew of Apollo 17.&quot;&lt;ref name=alsjeva3&gt;{{cite web|title=EVA-3 Close-out|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.clsout3.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=22 August 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110718153102/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.clsout3.html| archivedate= 18 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cernan then followed Schmitt into the Lunar Module after spending approximately seven hours and 15 minutes outside during the mission's final lunar excursion.&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;

=== Return to Earth ===

[[File:Ap17-S72-55974.jpg|thumb|right|Apollo 17 post-landing recovery operations]]

Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt successfully lifted off from the lunar surface in the ascent stage of the Lunar Module on December 14, at 5:55&amp;nbsp;pm EST. After a successful rendezvous and docking with Ron Evans in the Command/Service Module in orbit, the crew transferred equipment and lunar samples between the LM and the CSM for return to Earth. Following this, the LM ascent stage was sealed off and jettisoned at 1:31&amp;nbsp;am on December 15. The ascent stage was then deliberately crashed into the Moon in a collision recorded by [[seismometer]]s deployed on Apollo 17 and previous Apollo expeditions.&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;&lt;ref name=alsjreturn&gt;{{cite web|title=Return to Earth|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/a17/a17.homeward.html|publisher=Apollo Lunar Surface Journal|accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 17, during the trip back to Earth, at 3:27&amp;nbsp;pm EST, Ron Evans successfully conducted a one hour and seven minute spacewalk to retrieve exposed film from the instrument bay on the exterior of the CSM.&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;

On December 19, the crew jettisoned the no-longer-needed Service Module, leaving only the Command Module for return to Earth. The Apollo 17 spacecraft [[Atmospheric entry|reentered Earth's atmosphere]] and landed safely in the [[Pacific Ocean]] at 2:25&amp;nbsp;pm, {{convert|6.4|km|mi|sp=us}} from the recovery ship, the [[USS Ticonderoga (CV-14)|USS ''Ticonderoga'']]. Cernan, Evans and Schmitt were then retrieved by a recovery helicopter and were safely aboard the recovery ship 52 minutes after landing.&lt;ref name=astronautix/&gt;&lt;ref name=alsjreturn/&gt;

The ascent stage of lunar module ''Challenger'' impacted the Moon December 15, 1972 at 06:50:20.8 UT (1:50&amp;nbsp;am EST), at {{Coord|19.96|N|30.50|E|globe:Moon|name=Apollo 17 LM ascent stage}}.&lt;ref name=currentloc/&gt; The descent stage remains on the Moon at the landing site, {{Coord|20.19080|N|30.77168|E|globe:Moon|name=Apollo 17 LM descent stage}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orloff&quot;/&gt;

In 2009 and again in 2011, the [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]] photographed the landing site from increasingly low orbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/news/apollo-sites.html |title=NASA Spacecraft Images Offer Sharper Views of Apollo Landing Sites |last1=Neal-Jones |first1=Nancy |last2=Zubritsky |first2=Elizabeth |last3=Cole |first3=Steve |editor-last=Garner |editor-first=Robert |date=September 6, 2011 |publisher=NASA |id=Goddard Release No. 11-058 (co-issued as NASA HQ Release No. 11-289) |accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Depiction of mission in fiction ==

Portions of the Apollo 17 mission are dramatized in the 1998 [[HBO]] miniseries ''[[From the Earth to the Moon (TV miniseries)|From the Earth to the Moon]]'' episode entitled [[From the Earth to the Moon (TV miniseries)#Episodes|&quot;Le Voyage dans la Lune.&quot;]]&lt;ref name=hbomin&gt;{{cite web|title=From the Earth to the Moon - Season 1, Episode 12: Le Voyage Dans La Lune|url=http://www.tv.com/from-the-earth-to-the-moon/le-voyage-dans-la-lune/episode/159367/summary.html|work=[[TV.com]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|location=San Francisco, CA|accessdate=26 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prologue to the 1999 novel ''[[Back to the Moon]]'', by [[Homer Hickam]], begins with a dramatized depiction of the end of the second Apollo 17 EVA. The orange soil then becomes the major driver of the plot of the rest of the story.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hickam 1999|Hickam 1999]], pp. 3–8&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 novel ''[[Tyrannosaur Canyon]]'' by [[Douglas Preston]] opens with a depiction of the Apollo 17 moonwalks using quotes taken from the official mission transcript.&lt;ref name=tycanyon&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Patrick|title=Rex Marks the Spot|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/18/AR2005091801146.html|accessdate=24 August 2011|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=19 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there have been fictional astronauts in film, literature and television who have been described as &quot;the last man to walk on the Moon,&quot; implying they were crew members on Apollo 17. One such character was [[Steve Austin (fictional character)|Steve Austin]] in the television series ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]''. In the 1972 novel ''[[Cyborg (novel)|Cyborg]]'', upon which the series was based, Austin remembers watching the Earth &quot;fall away during Apollo XVII.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Caidin 1972|Caidin 1972]], p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1998 film ''[[Deep Impact (film)|Deep Impact]]'' fictional astronaut Spurgeon &quot;Fish&quot; Tanner, portrayed by [[Robert Duvall]], was described at a Presidential press conference as the &quot;last man to walk on the moon&quot; by the President of the United States, portrayed by [[Morgan Freeman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.subzin.com/search.php?title=Deep+Impact&amp;imdb=&amp;q=You+were+the+last+man+to+walk+on+the+moon%2C+weren%27t+you&amp;search_sort=Popularity&amp;genre=-1&amp;type=All |title=Deep Impact quotes |work=Subzin.com |accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Anime [[Aldnoah.Zero]], the Apollo 17 mission locates an ancient transporter gate leading to Mars left by an unknown, extinct alien race. This discovery is the divergence point for the story's alternate history.
