'''Bob Jones University''' ('''BJU''') is a [[Private university|private]] non-denominational [[Protestant]] university in [[Greenville, South Carolina]], known for its conservative cultural and religious positions. It has approximately 2,800 students, and the school is accredited by the [[Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools]]. In 2008, the university estimated the number of its graduates at 35,000. The university's athletic teams compete in Division I of the [[National Christian College Athletic Association]] (NCCAA) and are collectively known as the Bruins.

==History==
{{main|History of Bob Jones University}}
[[File:Bob Jones, Sr.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Bob Jones, Sr.]], the university's founder]]
During the [[The Fundamentalist-Modernist Controversy|Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy]] of the 1920s, Christian evangelist [[Bob Jones, Sr.]] grew increasingly  concerned about the secularization of higher education and the influence of religious liberalism in denominational colleges. Children of church members were attending college, only to reject the faith of their parents. Jones later recalled that in 1924, his friend [[William Jennings Bryan]] had leaned over to him at a Bible conference service in [[Winona Lake, Indiana]], and said, &quot;If schools and colleges do not quit teaching evolution as a fact, we are going to become a nation of atheists.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Turner, 19&lt;/ref&gt; While he himself was not a college graduate, Jones grew determined to found one, and on September 12, 1927, he opened Bob Jones College in [[Panama City, Florida|Panama City]], with 88 students. Jones said that although he had been averse to naming the school after himself, his friends overcame his reluctance &quot;with the argument that the school would be called by that name because of my connection with it, and to attempt to give it any other name would confuse the people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Turner, 23–25. In the earliest years of the college, important contributions were made to its stability by J. Floyd Collins and [[Eunice Hutto]]. Johnson, 180, 198.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bob Jones took no salary from the college and helped support the school with personal savings and income from his evangelistic campaigns. Both time and place were inauspicious. The [[Florida land boom]] had peaked in 1925, and a hurricane in September 1926 further reduced land values. The [[Great Depression]] followed hard on its heels. Bob Jones College barely survived bankruptcy and its move to [[Cleveland, Tennessee]] in 1933. However, Jones's move to Cleveland proved extraordinarily advantageous.  Bankrupt at the nadir of the Depression, without a home, and with barely enough money to move its library and office furniture, the college became in thirteen years the largest liberal arts college in Tennessee. With the enactment of [[GI Bill]] at the end of [[World War II]], the college was virtually forced to seek a new location and build a new campus.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, 68, 101–02.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he had served as Acting President as early as 1934, Jones' son, [[Bob Jones, Jr.]] officially became the school's second president in 1947 just before the college moved to [[Greenville, South Carolina]], and became Bob Jones University.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, 57–58. On the move to Greenville see John Matzko, &quot;'This Is It, Isn't It, Brother Stone?' The Move of Bob Jones University from Cleveland, Tennessee, to Greenville, 1946–47&quot;, ''South Carolina Historical Magazine'', 108 (July 2007), 235–256. The former Cleveland campus currently serves as the home of [[Lee University]], an institution supported by the [[Church of God (Cleveland)|Church of God]].&lt;/ref&gt; In Greenville, the university more than doubled in size within two years and started its own radio station, film department, and art gallery—the latter of which eventually became one of the largest collections of religious art in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;Hilde S. Hein, ''Public Art: Thinking Museums Differently'' (Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press, 2006), xxix.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1950s, BJU and alumnus [[Billy Graham (evangelist)|Billy Graham]], who had attended Bob Jones College for one semester and received an [[honorary degree]] from the university in 1948,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; engaged in a controversy about the propriety of theological conservatives cooperating with theological liberals to support evangelistic campaigns, a controversy that widened an already growing rift between separatist fundamentalists and other evangelicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative publicity caused by the dispute precipitated a decline in BJU enrollment of about 10% in the years 1956–59, and seven members of the university board (of about a hundred) also resigned in support of Graham, including Graham himself and two of his staff members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=179–188, 253}}&lt;/ref&gt; When, in 1966, Graham held his only American campaign in Greenville,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=183}} Graham had only three campaigns scheduled that year: London, Berlin, and Greenville, South Carolina.&lt;/ref&gt; the university forbade any BJU dormitory student from attending under penalty of expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;No Bob Jones University dormitory student will be permitted to go to a single meeting of the Greenville crusade. No Bob Jones University adult student, if he is married or lives in town, may attend the crusade and remain as a student.&quot; [[Bob Jones, Jr.]], Chapel talk, February 8, 1965, Mack Library Archives, quoted in {{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=184}}. An exception was made for Bob Jones Academy students who lived in town with their parents.&lt;/ref&gt; Enrollment quickly rebounded, and by 1970, there were 3300 students, approximately 60% more than in 1958. In 1971, [[Bob Jones III]] became president at age 32, though his father, with the title of Chancellor, continued to exercise considerable administrative authority into the late 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, 205.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Although BJU had admitted Asians and other ethnic groups from its inception, it did not enroll Africans or African-American students until 1971. From 1971 to 1975, BJU admitted only married blacks, although the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) had already determined in 1970 that &quot;private schools with racially discriminatory admissions policies&quot; were not entitled to federal tax exemption. In 1975, the University Board of Trustees authorized a change in policy to admit black students, a move that occurred shortly before the announcement of the Supreme Court decision in ''[[Runyon v. McCrary]]'' (427 U.S. 160 [1976]), which prohibited racial exclusion in private schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=226–227}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in May of that year, BJU expanded rules against interracial dating and marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=461&amp;invol=574 ''Bob Jones University v. United States''] (461 U.S. 574, 581)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, the [[Internal Revenue Service]] revoked the university's tax exemption retroactively to December 1, 1970 on grounds that it was practicing racial discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=461&amp;invol=574 ''Bob Jones University v. United States''] (461 U.S. 574 @725)&lt;/ref&gt; The case eventually was heard by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in 1982. After BJU lost the decision in ''[[Bob Jones University v. United States]]'' (461 U.S. 574)[1983], the university chose to maintain its interracial dating policy and pay a million dollars in back taxes. The year following the Court decision, contributions to the university declined by 13 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=236}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, following a media uproar prompted by the visit of presidential candidate [[George W. Bush]] to the university, Bob Jones III dropped the university's interracial dating rule, announcing the change on [[CNN|CNN's]] &quot;[[Larry King Live]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Dancing with Compromise&quot; (April 2000), [http://multiracial.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=285&amp;Itemid=27 The Multiracial Activist].&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year Bob Jones III drew criticism when he reposted a letter on the university's web page referring to [[Mormons]] and [[Catholics]] as &quot;cults which call themselves Christian&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beliefnet.com/story/15/story_1544_1.html Beliefnet.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Stephen Jones (academic administrator)|Stephen Jones]], great-grandson of the founder, became BJU's president on the same day that he received his [[Ph.D.]] from the school.  Bob Jones III then took the title Chancellor. In 2008, the university declared itself &quot;profoundly sorry&quot; for having allowed &quot;institutional policies to remain in place that were racially hurtful.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/education/2008-11-24-bob-jones-university-race_N.htm USA Today, November 24, 2008]; [http://www.bju.edu/communities/ministries-schools/position-statements/race-statement.php Statement about Race at Bob Jones University]. In the statement, the university admitted to having &quot;conformed to the culture&quot; rather than providing &quot;a clear Christian counterpoint to it.&quot; Earlier that year some BJU alumni expressed concern that the university had never repudiated its racist past and petitioned the school to make a formal apology. [http://www.greenvilleonline.com/article/20081122/NEWS01/311220002&amp;referrer=FRONTPAGECAROUSEL Greenville News, November 22, 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; That year BJU enrolled students from fifty states and nearly fifty countries, representing diverse ethnicities and cultures, and the BJU administration declared itself &quot;committed to maintaining on the campus the racial and cultural diversity and harmony characteristic of the true Church of Jesus Christ throughout the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/communities/ministries-schools/position-statements/race-statement.php Statement about Race at Bob Jones University].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the university became a member of the [[Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools]] (TRACS) and reinstated intercollegiate athletics.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Investiture of Stephen D. Pettit as Fifth President of Bob Jones University&quot; http://www.bju.edu/about/president/program.pdf; [http://www.christiancentury.org/article/2011-11/looking-catholic-art-fundamentalist-bob-jones-university-has-it ''Christian Century'', November 2011].&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, it replaced the &quot;BJ&quot; logo that had been used since 1967 with a new shield logo based on the university crest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bju.edu/news/2013-08-06-visual-identity.php|title=BJU Unveils New Academic Visual Identity|date=6 August 2013|publisher=Bob Jones University|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Stephen Jones resigned for health reasons, and the following year, [[Steve Pettit]] was named BJU's president, the first unrelated to the Jones family.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/education/2014/05/08/new-bju-president-announced-today/8857031/ ''Greenville News'', May 9, 2014].

Pettit as Fifth President of Bob Jones University&quot;] ; ''Greenville News'', September 20, 2014, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the publication of ''Competent to Counsel'' by [[Jay E. Adams|Jay Adams]] (1970), BJU tended to emphasize [[Nouthetic counseling|nouthetic counseling]], and especially counseling techniques developed by Dean of Students [[Jim Berg]].  In the early 2010s, in response to complaints by former students that they had been given improper counsel about [[sexual abuse]], BJU commissioned a group called G.R.A.C.E. (Godly Response to Abuse in the Christian Environment) to investigate the charges. In December 2014, G.R.A.C.E. concluded that university personnel had provided improper advice to some students, including discouraging some from reporting incidents of sexual abuse to the police, and had also not fulfilled their obligations under South Carolina state law to report abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://netgrace.org/wp-content/uploads/Final-Report.pdf|title=Investigatory Review of Sexual Abuse Disclosures and Institutional Responses at Bob Jones University|date=11 December 2014|publisher=G.R.A.C.E.|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/12/us/bob-jones-university-sex-assault-victim-study.html|title=Bob Jones University Blamed Victims of Sexual Assaults, Not Abusers, Report Says|last=Perez-Pena|first=Richard|date=11 December 2014|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
The university occupies 205 acres at the eastern city limit of Greenville. The institution moved into its initial 25 buildings during the 1947–48 school year, and later buildings were also faced with the light yellow brick chosen for the originals.&lt;ref&gt;BJU Catalog (2011–12), 235; John Matzko, &quot;'This is it, Isn't it, Brother, Stone?'

The University updated its dining common and snack bar, which includes a Chick Fil' A, Brody's Grill, and Papa Johns.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museum and gallery===
[[Bob Jones, Jr.]] was a connoisseur of European art and began collecting after [[World War II]] on about $30,000 a year authorized by the University Board of Directors.&lt;ref name=&quot;art&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=193–196}}{{cite book|author=Jones Jr., Bob|title=Cornbread and Caviar|publisher=BJU Press|year=1985|pages=48–49}} &quot;A Collector's Dream&quot; ''Greenville Piedmont'', 9 February 1989, A1.&lt;/ref&gt; Jones first concentrated on the [[Baroque painting|Italian Baroque]], a style then out of favor and relatively inexpensive in the years immediately following the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;art&quot;/&gt; Fifty years after the opening of the gallery, the BJU collection included more than 400 European paintings from the 14th to through the 19th centuries (mostly pre-19th century), period furniture, and a notable collection of Russian icons.&lt;ref name=&quot;MandG&quot;&gt;[http://bjumg.org/the-collection/ Museum &amp; Gallery Collections]&lt;/ref&gt; The museum also includes a variety of Holy Land antiquities collected in the early 20th century by missionaries Frank and Barbara Bowen.&lt;ref name=&quot;MandG&quot;/&gt;
Not surprisingly, the gallery is especially strong in Baroque paintings and includes notable works by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach]], [[Gerard David]], [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]], [[Mattia Preti]], [[Jusepe de Ribera|Ribera]], [[van Dyck]], and [[Gustave Doré]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MandG&quot;/&gt; Included in the Museum &amp; Gallery collection are seven very large canvases, part of a series by [[Benjamin West]] painted for [[George III]], called &quot;The Progress of Revealed Religion&quot;, which are displayed in the War Memorial Chapel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjumg.org/the-benjamin-west-collection/ BJU Museum &amp; Gallery website history of the West paintings].&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Baroque painting|Baroque art]] was created during—and often for—the [[Counter-Reformation]] and so, ironically, BJU has been criticized by some other fundamentalists for promoting &quot;false Catholic doctrine&quot; through its art gallery.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rapidnet.com/~jbeard/bdm/Psychology/bju/fundam.htm] Example of fundamentalist criticism of BJU for promoting Catholicism.

Fundamentalist Bob Jones University has it&quot; ''Christian Century'', Nov 22, 2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of Bob Jones, Jr., Erin Jones, the wife of BJU president Stephen Jones, became director. According to David Steel, curator of European art at the [[North Carolina Museum of Art]], Erin Jones &quot;brought that museum into the modern era&quot;, employing &quot;a top-notch curator, John Nolan&quot;, and following &quot;best practices in conservation and restoration.&quot; The museum now regularly cooperates with other institutions, lending works for outside shows such as a Rembrandt exhibit in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;David Gibson, [http://www.christiancentury.org/article/2011-11/looking-catholic-art-fundamentalist-bob-jones-university-has-it &quot;Looking for Catholic art?

In 2008, the BJU Museum &amp; Gallery opened a satellite location, the &quot;Museum &amp; Gallery at Heritage Green&quot; near downtown Greenville, which features rotating exhibitions from the main museum as well as interactive children's activities. The Heritage Green building, an extensively remodeled [[Coca-Cola]] bottling plant, joined the neighboring [[Upcountry History Museum]] and the Greenville Children's Museum, all of which feature &quot;the latest in museum technology.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Extraordinary art made more accessible&quot;, ''Greenville News'', [http://www.greenvilleonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2008803170303 March 17, 2008]; &quot;Sacred art museum opens today&quot;, ''Greenville News'', [http://greenvilleonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080419/OPINION/804190306/1004/NEWS01 April 19, 2008].

Each Easter season, the university and the Museum &amp; Gallery present the ''Living Gallery'', a series of [[tableaux vivants]] recreating noted works of religious art using live models disguised as part of two-dimensional paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenvilleonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060409/ENT01/604090313 ''Greenville News'', April 9, 2006]; &quot;A dramatic transformation: BJU's 'Living Gallery' breathes life into religious masterworks&quot;, [http://greenvilleonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080323/ENT01/80321068/1056/ENT ''Greenville News'', March 25, 2008].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Library===
[[File:JerusalemChamberBJU.JPG|thumb|right|Jerusalem Chamber, Mack Library, containing a collection of rare Bibles.]]
The {{convert|90000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} Mack Library (named for [[John Sephus Mack]]) holds a collection of more than 300,000 books and includes seating for 1,200 as well as a computer lab and a computer classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=434}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Its ancillary, a music library, is included in the Gustafson Fine Arts Center.)

The library's Fundamentalism File collects periodical articles and ephemera about social and religious matters of interest to evangelicals and fundamentalists.&lt;ref&gt;The Fundamentalism File, created in 1978, has more than 100,000 non-book items, mostly articles listed under 5,000 subject headings; it also contains the papers of three notable 20th-century fundamentalists: G. Archer Weniger (1915–1982), W. O. H. Garman (1899–1983), and Gilbert Stenholm (1915–1989). [http://libguides.bju.edu/ffile BJU Library website, Fundamentalism File, Introduction to the File]&lt;/ref&gt; The university Archives holds copies of all university publications, [[oral histories]] of faculty and staff members, surviving remnants of university correspondence, and pictures and artifacts related to the Jones family and the history of the university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libguides.bju.edu/content.php?pid=208607&amp;sid=1738606 BJU Archives Research]. For instance, the archives hold decades of working scripts for university stage performances.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
The university consists of seven colleges and schools that offer more than 60 undergraduate majors, including fourteen associate degree programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/academics/majors/ BJU website]&lt;/ref&gt; Although BJU's faculty is untenured faculty, most University employees consider their positions as much ministries as jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|publisher=BJU Press|year=1997|pages=251–252}}{{cite book|author=Wright, Melton|title=Fortress of Faith: The Story of Bob Jones University|publisher=BJU Press|year=1984|page=194}}: &quot;Bob Jones University has a scholarly, dedicated faculty who regard teaching as not just a profession but as a Christian calling.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for retiring professors to have served the university for thirty, forty, and even occasionally, fifty years, a circumstance that has contributed to the stability and conservatism of an institution of higher learning that has virtually no endowment and at which faculty salaries are &quot;sacrificial.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Voice of the Alumni'' [publication of the BJU Alumni Association], 1996–2006. In 1993, the CFO Roy Barton said that teachers' salaries were kept as &quot;low as possible in order to offer affordable higher education to Christians.&quot; Barton said he could name &quot;dozens of people who work here for half or a third of what they could be earning on the outside, but they are here because of a desire to be part of the ministry of training young people.&quot; ''Greenville News'', April 18, 1993, &quot;Upstate Business&quot;, 11. In the same ''Greenville News'' issue, Bob Jones III said, &quot;Everyone here is like a missionary.&quot; (10)&lt;/ref&gt;

BJU does not have federal tax-exempt status, but a number of its ancillaries, including Bob Jones Academy and the BJU Museum &amp; Gallery, are tax-exempt entities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/giving/ BJU webpage]; &quot;Investing in Lives for Eternity&quot;, BJU Advancement brochure (2008), 15, Bob Jones University Archives, Mack Library.

===Religious education===
The School of Religion includes majors for both men and women, although only men train as ministerial students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/academics/college-and-schools/religion/ BJU School of Religion].&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these students go on to a [[seminary]] after completing their undergraduate degree. Others take ministry positions straight from college, and rising juniors participate in a church internship program to prepare them for the pastoral ministry. In 1995 there were 1,290 BJU graduates serving as senior or associate pastors in churches across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dalhouse, Mark Taylor|title=An Island in the Lake of Fire: Bob Jones University, Fundamentalism &amp; the Separatist Movement|pages=148–151}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fine Arts===
The Division of Fine Arts has the largest faculty of the university's six undergraduate schools.&lt;ref&gt;Of about 350 faculty members listed in the 2007–08 catalog, around a hundred, or roughly 30% taught in the Division of Fine Arts.

===Rankings and accreditation===
Bob Jones, Sr. was leery of academic accreditation almost from the founding of the college, and by the early 1930s, he had publicly stated his opposition to holding [[regional accreditation]].&lt;ref&gt;However, in the earliest college catalog (called &quot;An Epoch in Education&quot;) Jones wrote, &quot;Having met all the requirements, we have made application for admission to the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools.&quot; (32)&lt;/ref&gt; Not surprisingly, Jones and the college were criticized for this stance, and academic recognition, as well as student and faculty recruitment, were hindered.&lt;ref name=p68&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, Jones wrote to [[John Walvoord]] of [[Dallas Theological Seminary]] that while the university had &quot;no objection to educational work highly standardized….We, however, cannot conscientiously let some group of educational experts or some committee of experts who may have a behavioristic or atheistic slant on education control or even influence the administrative policies of our college.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jones to Walwoord, May 8, 1944 in {{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=354–355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, Jones reflected that &quot;it cost us something to stay out of an association, but we stayed out. We have lived up to our convictions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jones to James O. Buswell, May 12, 1949, in {{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, lack of accreditation seems to have made little difference during the post-war period, when the university more than doubled in size.&lt;ref name=p68/&gt;

Because graduates did not have the benefit of accredited degrees, the faculty felt an increased responsibility to prepare their students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the history of the college, there had been some hesitancy on the part of other institutions to accept BJU credits at face value, but by the 1960s, BJU alumni were being accepted by most of the major graduate and professional schools in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;BJU's reputation in academic circles gradually became more respected for the intellectual preparation and strong character of its graduates. By the 1960s several graduate schools actively courted university alumni, and BJU graduates were accepted into most of the major graduate programs in the country despite the school's opposition to regional accreditation.&quot; {{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=203, 353–355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undoubtedly helpful was that some of the university's strongest programs were in the areas of music, speech, and art, disciplines in which ability could be measured by audition or portfolio rather than through paper qualifications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Collins 2007&quot;&gt;Michael Collins, &quot;Accreditation at Bob Jones University&quot; (2007), unpublished paper, Bob Jones University Archives, Mack Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, by the early 2000s, the university quietly reexamined its position on accreditation as [[degree mills]] proliferated and various government bureaucracies, such as law enforcement agencies, began excluding BJU graduates on the grounds that the university did not appear on appropriate federal lists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Collins 2007&quot;/&gt; In 2004, the university began the process of joining the [[Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools]]. Candidate status—effectively, accreditation—was obtained in April 2005, and full membership in the Association was conferred in November 2006.&lt;ref&gt;BJU is also a founding member of the [[American Association of Christian Colleges and Seminaries]], a small group of institutions &quot;clearly identified with the historic Christian fundamentalist tradition.&quot;[http://www.aaccs.info/members.asp American Association of Christian Colleges and Seminaries].&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, BJU announced its intention to apply for regional accreditation with the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] (SACS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenvilleonline.com/article/20111207/NEWS/312070043/BJU-pursue-accreditation ''Greenville News'', December 7, 2011]. The university said that &quot;significant changes&quot; in SACS' approach to accreditation, including &quot;respect [for] the stated mission of the institution, including religious mission&quot; had addressed its earlier concerns about regional accreditation. [http://www.bju.edu/news/2011-12-05-regional-accreditation.php?utm_source=News-Events&amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_content=homepage&amp;utm_campaign=RSS-News BJU website].&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Forbes]]'' national university ranking, Bob Jones was unranked in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/top-colleges/list/#p_1_s_arank_SC|title=National University Rankings|year=2011|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; #606 in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/94/best-colleges-10_Bob-Jones-University_94571.html|title=National University Rankings|year=2010|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and #279 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/94/colleges-09_Bob-Jones-University_94571.html|title=National University Rankings|year=2009|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=23 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Educate to Career College Ranking Index listed BJU as 15th in the nation by economic value.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;BJU ranked as 15th-best value&quot;, ''Greenville News'', September 8, 2014, 3A; www.educatetocareer.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancillary ministries==

===''Unusual Films''===
Both [[Bob Jones, Sr.]] and [[Bob Jones, Jr.]] believed that [[film]] could be an excellent medium for mass evangelism, and in 1950, the university established ''Unusual Films'' within the School of Fine Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=196–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The studio name derives from a former BJU promotional slogan, &quot;The World's Most Unusual University&quot;.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bob Jones, Jr.]] selected a speech teacher, [[Katherine Stenholm]], as the first director. Although she had no experience in cinema, she took summer courses at the [[University of Southern California]] and received personal instruction from Hollywood specialists, such as [[Rudolph Sternad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=196–199}}; [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0827889/ biographical information on Sternad]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusual Films has produced seven feature-length films, each with an evangelistic emphasis: ''Wine of Morning'', ''Red Runs the River'', ''Flame in the Wind'', ''Sheffey'', ''Beyond the Night'', ''The Printing'', and ''Milltown Pride''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bjupress.com/nav/category/Unusual%20Films%20Productions?parent_category_rn=281459 List of movies produced by Unusual Films]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wine of Morning'' (1955), based on a novel by Bob Jones, Jr., represented the United States at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Wine of Morning'' was selected by the University Film Producers Association to represent the United States at the International Congress of Motion Picture and Television Schools in Cannes, France, and following a showing at the Congress, garnered praise from the international film community. ''Wine of Morning'' was also awarded four 'Christian Oscars' from the National Evangelical Film Foundation for Best Film, Best Actor, Best Director, and Best Producer.&quot; {{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=198}}. There may have been some [[Cold War]] posturing involved in the nomination of this film. The president of the UFPA wrote to Stenholm that the &quot;excellence of your production, ''Wine of Morning''...will provide the high quality which it is desirable to use in these international showings. We feel that the contrast between your film with its religious background and [the Russian entry] would be most revealing and that the contrast would reflect credit on our way of life.&quot; (&quot;Bob Jones Religious Film To Represent US Colleges&quot;, ''The (Columbia, SC) State'', May 2, 1958, 12C).&lt;/ref&gt; The first four films are historical dramas set, respectively, in the time of Christ, the U.S. Civil War, 16th-century Spain, and the late 19th-century South—the latter a fictionalized treatment of the life of Methodist evangelist, [[Robert Sheffey|Robert Sayers Sheffey]]. ''Beyond the Night'' closely follows an actual 20th-century missionary saga in Central Africa, and ''The Printing'' uses composite characters to portray the persecution of believers in the former [[Soviet Union]]. In 1999, Unusual Films began producing feature film for children, including &quot;The Treasure Map&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Treasure Map|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2335886/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Project Dinosaur&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Dinosaur|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3204902/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Appalachian Trial&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Appalachian Trial|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0467386/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also released a short animated film for children, &quot;The Golden Rom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Golden Rom|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3212502/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unusual Films returned to their customary format in 2011 with their release of &quot;Milltown Pride&quot;, a historical film set in 1920s Upstate South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milltown Pride|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1888554/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unusual Films also maintains a student film production program. The Cinema Production program is designed to give professional training in all facets of motion picture production. This training combines classroom instruction with hands-on experience in a variety of areas including directing, editing, and cinematography. Before graduation, seniors produce their own high definition short film in which they write, direct, and edit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bob Jones University Undergraduate Catalog|year=2013–2014|pages=112, 193–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BJU Press===
{{main|BJU Press}}
[[BJU Press]] originated in the need for textbooks for the burgeoning [[Christian school]] movement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=236, 264}}&lt;/ref&gt; and today it is the largest book publisher in South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=264–267}} Although it published its first trade book, a history of fundamentalism, in 1973, its first text was George Mulfinger and Emmet Williams, ''Physical Science for Christian Schools'' published in 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; The Press publishes a full range of K–12 textbooks. More than a million pre-college students around the world use BJU textbooks, and the Press has about 2,500 titles in print.

BJU Press also offers distance learning courses via online, DVD, and hard drive.&lt;ref&gt;Until May 2009, [[BJU Press]] offered elementary and high school classes via satellite over the BJ HomeSat Network and BJ LINC (Live Interactive Network Classroom), an interactive satellite system that allowed a teacher in Greenville to communicate with [[Christian school]] students across the country. In 2006, about 45,000 students participated in BJU's distance-learning programs.{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=264–266}}; ''Greenville News'', 20 September 2006, 9A; ''BJU Catalog'', 2007–08, 329.&lt;/ref&gt; Another ancillary, the Academy of Home Education, is a &quot;service organization for homeschooling families&quot;, that maintains student records, administers achievement testing, and issues high school diplomas. The Press sold its music division, [[SoundForth]], to [[Lorenz Publishing]] on October 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christian Music from BJU Press|url=http://www.bjupress.com/category/Music|accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-college programs===
The university operates Bob Jones Academy, an elementary, middle, and high school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bobjonesacademy.net/ BJA website].&lt;/ref&gt; The school of about 1500 students is the largest K–12 private school in the Carolinas and one of the largest in the Southeast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenvilleonline.com/article/20110219/NEWS/302190023/Bob-Jones-Academy-to-become-largest-private-K-12-school-in-Carolinas. Greenville News, February 19, 2011]. About 30% of BJA students are children of BJU staff members.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;I believe in the inspiration of the [[Bible]] (both the [[Old Testament|Old]] and the [[New Testament]]s); the [[Creationism|creation]] of man by the direct act of [[God]]; the incarnation and virgin birth of our Lord and Saviour, [[Jesus]] Christ; His identification as the Son of God; His vicarious atonement for the [[sin]]s of mankind by the shedding of His blood on the cross; the [[resurrection]] of His body from the tomb; His power to save men from sin; the new birth through the regeneration by the [[Holy Spirit]]; and the gift of eternal life by the grace of God.&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;|— BJU Creed
|}
Religion is a major aspect of life and curriculum at BJU. The BJU Creed, written in 1927 by journalist and prohibitionist [[Samuel W. Small|Sam Small]], is recited by students and faculty four days a week at chapel services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/about-bju/creed.php BJU website.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The university also encourages [[church planting]] in areas of the United States &quot;in great need of fundamental churches&quot;, and it has provided financial and logistical assistance to ministerial graduates in starting more than a hundred new churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/communities/ministries-schools/church-planting/ BJU website on church planting]&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Jones III has also encouraged non-ministerial students to put their career plans on hold for two or three years to provide lay leadership for small churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=270–271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students of various majors participate in Missions Advance (formerly Mission Prayer Band), an organization that prays for missionaries and attempts to stimulate campus interest in world evangelism.&lt;ref name=&quot;studentlife&quot;&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/campus/life/orgs.html BJU Student Life]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}; ''Collegian'', 24 (February 4, 2011), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; During summers and Christmas breaks, about 150 students participate in teams that use their musical, language, trade, and aviation skills to promote Christian missions around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eternity 2008&quot;/&gt; Although a separate nonprofit corporation, Gospel Fellowship Association, an organization founded by Bob Jones Sr. and associated with BJU, is one of the largest fundamentalist mission boards in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gfamissions.org/ GFA Missions website][http://www.bju.edu/about-bju/additional-ministries.php BJU website]. BJU's website calls it an &quot;additional ministry.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Through its &quot;Timothy Fund&quot;, the university also sponsors international students who are training for the ministry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/giving/students.html BJU website]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}; &quot;Timothy program offers foreign students Bible training&quot;, [http://www.bju.edu/collegian/index.php?issue=70&amp;article=679 ''Collegian'', April 12, 2007].&lt;/ref&gt;

The university requires use of the [[King James Version]] (KJV) of the Bible in its services and classrooms, but it does not hold that the KJV is the only acceptable English translation or that it has the same authority as the original Hebrew and Greek manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|pages=244–245}} [http://www.bju.edu/communities/ministries-schools/position-statements/translation.php &quot;Statement about Bible Translations&quot;, BJU website].&lt;/ref&gt; The university's position has been condemned by some other fundamentalists. In 1998, [[Pensacola Christian College]] produced a widely distributed videotape, arguing that this &quot;leaven of fundamentalism&quot; was passed from the 19th-century Princeton theologian [[Benjamin B. Warfield]] (1851–1921) to Charles Brokenshire (1885–1954), who served BJU as Dean of the School of Religion, and then to current BJU faculty members and graduates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.troyandjessica.com/node/20 Documents on the BJU-Pensacola controversy archived on a private website].&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, [[Peter Ruckman]], a BJU graduate, has argued the most extreme version of the KJV-only position, that all translations of the Bible since the KJV have been of satanic origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Daniel|title=Standing Without Apology: The History of Bob Jones University|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rules of conduct===
Strict rules govern student life at BJU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/student-life/2011-student-handbook.pdf Student Handbook (pdf)] ([http://www.webcitation.org/67JNFOPWa Archive]). In January 2012, [http://www.collegemagazine.com/editorial/2104/The-Top-10-Most-Sexually-Repressed-Colleges ''College Magazine.com''] identified BJU as number 1 among the &quot;Ten Most Prude Colleges&quot; ahead of other religious universities such as Bringham Young (3) and Notre Dame (6).&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these are based directly on the university's interpretation of the Bible. For instance, the 2011–12 Student Handbook states, &quot;Students are to avoid any types of entertainment that could be considered immodest or that contain profanity, scatological realism, sexual perversion, erotic realism, lurid violence, occultism and false philosophical or religious assumptions.&quot; Grounds for immediate dismissal include stealing, immorality (including sexual relations between unmarried students), possession of hard-core pornography, use of alcohol or drugs, and participating in a public demonstration for a cause the university opposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/student-life/2011-student-handbook.pdf BJU Student Handbook, 2011–12, 28,45.]&lt;/ref&gt; Similar &quot;moral failures&quot; are grounds for terminating the employment of faculty and staff. In 1998, a homosexual alumnus was threatened with arrest if he visited the campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctlibrary.com/1504 ''Christianity Today'' website: &quot;In October, alumnus Wayne Mouritzen, a 60-year-old retired pastor, received a letter from the fundamentalist school's dean of students saying &quot;as long as you are living as a homosexual, you, of course, would not be welcome on the campus and would be arrested for trespassing if you did visit.&quot; The ban does not apply to the campus art museum, which could lose its tax-exempt status for such action.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other rules are not based on a specific biblical passage. For instance, the Handbook notes that &quot;there is no specific Bible command that says, 'Thou shalt not be late to class,' but a student who wishes to display orderliness and concern for others will not come in late to the distraction of the teacher and other students.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''BJU Day Student Handbook'', 2007–08, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 a campus spokesman also said that one goal of the dress code was &quot;to teach our young people to dress professionally&quot; on campus while giving them &quot;the ability to...choose within the biblically accepted options of dress&quot; when they were off campus.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;BJU Changes Dress Code&quot;, ''Greenville Journal'', May 2, 2008, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional rules include the requirement that freshman resident hall students sign out before leaving campus and that resident hall students abide by a campus curfew of 10:30 pm, with lights out at midnight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/become-a-student/accepted-students/expectations/residence.php &quot;Student Expectations&quot;, BJU website]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students are forbidden to go to movie theaters while in residence, or listen to most contemporary popular music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/student-life/2011-student-handbook.pdf BJU Student Handbook, 2011–12, 28–29.]. &quot;While students are at the University, our goal is to teach them to appreciate music that is spiritually edifying and culturally valuable. For the BJU student, this precludes most of the music of our popular culture including rock, rap, jazz and country, as well as religious music that borrows from these styles.&quot; ''Bob Jones University Student Handbook'' (2010–11), 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Male students are required to have conservative hairstyles, and facial hair is prohibited for students under 25.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/student-life/student-handbook.pdf BJU Student Handbook, 2012–13, p. 39.]&lt;/ref&gt; Women are expected to dress modestly and wear knee-length dresses or skirts to class and religious services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/student-life/2011-student-handbook.pdf BJU Student Handbook, 2011–12, 31–33.]&lt;/ref&gt; The university prohibits students from wearing clothing that displays the logos of [[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch]] or its subsidiary [[Hollister Co.|Hollister]] because these companies have &quot;shown an unusual degree of antagonism to biblical morality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bju.edu/student-life/2011-student-handbook.pdf BJU Student Handbook, 2011–12, 32.]&lt;/ref&gt;
