'''Charles William &quot;Bill&quot; Mumy, Jr.''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|uː|m|i}}; born February 1, 1954), is an American actor, musician, pitchman, instrumentalist, [[voice-over artist]], and a figure in the science-fiction community.  He is most famous for his many appearances on TV as a child actor in the 1960s.

The red-headed Mumy came to prominence in the 1960s as a child actor, when he was credited as '''Billy Mumy'''. His most notable role was in the 1960s [[CBS]] sci-fi television series ''[[Lost in Space]]'', where he played Will Robinson, the youngest of three children in the Robinson family.

He later appeared as lonely teenager [[Sterling North]] in the 1969 Disney film ''[[Rascal (film)|Rascal]]'' with [[Steve Forrest (actor)|Steve Forrest]]. He was cast as Teft in the 1971 film ''[[Bless the Beasts and Children (film)|Bless the Beasts and Children]]''. In the 1990s, he had the role of [[Lennier]] in the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] sci-fi TV series ''[[Babylon 5]]'', and also served as narrator of [[A&amp;E Network]]'s [[Emmy Award]]-winning series ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]''. He is also notable for his musical career, as a solo artist and as half of the duo [[Barnes &amp; Barnes]].

==Early life and career==
Mumy was born in [[San Gabriel, California|San Gabriel]], the son of the former Muriel Gertrude Gould and Charles William Mumy, Sr., a cattle rancher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/10/Bill-Mumy.html |title=Bill Mumy Biography (1954–)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began his professional career at age six, and has worked on more than four hundred television episodes, eighteen films, various commercials, and scores of voice-over work, as well as a musician, songwriter, recording artist and writer.

==Television and film career==
Among Mumy's earliest television roles was as 6-year-old Willy in the 1960 episode &quot;Donald's Friend&quot; of the [[NBC]] family drama [[television series]], ''[[National Velvet (TV series)|National Velvet]]'', starring [[Lori Martin]] as an aspiring thoroughbred rider.

Mumy appeared in [[CBS]]'s [[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|original ''Twilight Zone'']] (1959 to 1964). In the episode &quot;[[It's a Good Life (The Twilight Zone)|It's a Good Life]]&quot; (November 1961), he played a child who terrorizes his town with [[psychic]] powers—a role he later reprised along with his daughter [[Liliana Mumy]] in the ''[[It's Still a Good Life]]'' episode of [[The Twilight Zone (2002 TV series)|the second revival series]]. He also had a cameo in the remake of &quot;It's a Good Life&quot; in the 3rd segment of ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]''. Mumy also played young Pip, a boy who enjoyed playing with his father but was frequently ignored, in the episode &quot;[[In Praise of Pip]]&quot; (September 1963), and Billy Bayles, a boy who talks to his dead grandmother through a toy telephone, in the episode &quot;[[Long Distance Call]]&quot; (March 1961).  He also wrote the story for the episode ''[[Found and Lost]]'' in the second ''Twilight Zone'' revival.

Mumy was in an episode on ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'' in S13/EP12 (1962) called &quot;Jack and the Crying Cab Driver&quot;.

[[File:Alfred Hitchcock Presents Billy Mumy 1961.jpg|thumb|left|Mumy in the ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' episode ''Bang! You're Dead'', 1961]]
In 1961, Billy was cast on CBS's ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' television series in &quot;The Door Without a Key.&quot; The same episode features [[John Larch]], who played his father on the ''Twilight Zone'''s episode of &quot;It's a Good Life.&quot;  The same year, Mumy starred as little Jackie in the episode ''Bang! You're Dead''. It featured actress [[Marta Kristen]], who would later play his sister Judy on ''Lost in Space''.

Mumy was cast as Mark Murdock in the 1962 episode &quot;Keep an Eye on Santa Claus&quot; of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] drama series ''[[Going My Way (TV series)|Going My Way]]'', starring [[Gene Kelly]] as a [[Roman Catholic]] priest in [[New York City]] and loosely based on the 1944 [[Bing Crosby]] [[Going My Way|film]] of the same name. His fellow guest stars were [[Cloris Leachman]], who played his mother on the Twilight Zone's episode of &quot;It's a Good Life&quot;, [[Steve Brodie (actor)|Steve Brodie]]  and [[Frank McHugh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0937698/|title=&quot;Keep an Eye on Santa Claus&quot;, ''Going My Way'', December 12, 1962|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=March 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, at the age of eight, young Mumy appeared in [[Jack Palance]]'s ABC [[circus]] drama ''[[The Greatest Show on Earth (TV series)|The Greatest Show on Earth]]'', loosely based on a former [[Charlton Heston]] film. He was further cast in 1963 as Miles, a parentless boy, in the ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' episode &quot;The Case of the Shifty Shoebox.&quot; He portrayed Freddy in the 1963 episode &quot;End of an Image&quot; on the NBC modern western series ''[[Empire (1962 TV series)|Empire]]'', starring [[Richard Egan (actor)|Richard Egan]] as rancher Jim Redigo.

In 1964, he was cast as [[Richard Kimble]]'s nephew in ABC's ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'' in the 15th episode entitled &quot;Home Is The Hunted&quot;; as Barry in the [[NBC]] medical drama ''[[The Eleventh Hour (1962 TV series)|The Eleventh Hour]]'' episode &quot;Sunday Father&quot;; as himself three times in the ABC sitcom ''[[The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet]]''; in the [[Walt Disney|Disney]] film ''For the Love of Willadena''; and as a troubled orphan taken home with Darrin and Samantha Stephens in the episode &quot;[[List of Bewitched episodes#Season 1 (1964-1965)|A Vision of Sugarplums]]&quot; of ABC's fantasy sitcom ''[[Bewitched]]'' (December 1964).

Mumy was reportedly the first choice to portray [[Eddie Munster]] in the 1964 CBS situation comedy ''[[The Munsters]]'', but his parents objected because of the extensive makeup requirements. The role instead went to [[Butch Patrick]].  Mumy did appear in one episode as a friend of Eddie's. In 1965, he guest starred on an episode of NBC's ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'' &quot;Whatever Became Of Baby Custer?&quot; as a neighborhood kid who witnesses Jeannie's magic.  In the same year, he also appeared in an episode of ''[[Bewitched]]'' entitled &quot;Junior Executive&quot;, in which he played a young Darrin Stevens.

Between 1965 and 1968, Mumy portrayed Will Robinson in ''Lost in Space''. ''&quot;Danger, Will Robinson!&quot;''—a line frequently spoken by the character of the Robot (voiced by [[Dick Tufeld]])—has become an iconic phrase in sci-fi culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Danger Will Robinson&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Noland|first1=Claire|title=Dick Tufeld dies at 85; actor who intoned 'Danger, Will Robinson!'|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/25/local/la-me-dick-tufeld-20120125|accessdate=11 January 2015|publisher=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=25 January 2012|quote=Besides warning young Will Robinson of impending danger, Tufeld's Robot uttered other lines that became catchphrases for faithful viewers — including &quot;That does not compute&quot; — and needled the antagonistic Dr. Zachary Smith with barbs like &quot;Dr. Smith is a bubble-headed booby.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Mumy was cast in ''[[Bless the Beasts and Children (film)|Bless the Beasts and Children]]'', in which he played Teft, the leader of a group of misfit teenaged boys at a summer camp who resolved to save a herd of bison from hunters.

In 1973, he played a musician friend of [[Cliff DeYoung]] in the TV movie ''[[Sunshine (1973 film)|Sunshine]]'', and later reprised the role in ''[[Sunshine Christmas]]'' and in the TV series ''[[Sunshine (U.S. TV series)|Sunshine]]''.

In 1974, he played Nick Butler in the pilot episode of NBC's ''[[The Rockford Files]]''.

In 1996, he was a writer and co-creator of ''[[Space Cases]]'', a [[Nickelodeon]] television show with themes similar to ''Lost in Space''.

He played a [[Starfleet]] member in the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode &quot;[[The Siege of AR-558 (DS9 episode)|The Siege of AR-558]]&quot; (November 1998), where he assists [[Ezri Dax]] in turning cloaked [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]] mines against an army of [[Jem'Hadar]]. To Mumy's delight, his character was human this time; as [[Lennier]], he had always appeared in prosthetic makeup.

Mumy can be seen more recently in a 2006 episode of ''[[Crossing Jordan]]'' and in the [[Sci Fi]] original film ''[[A.I. Assault]]''.

To date, Mumy is perhaps best known for his role as [[Lost in Space#Characters|Will Robinson]] on the CBS science fiction television series ''Lost in Space'' (1965–1968), as well as for his role as ambassadorial aide [[Lennier]] in the syndicated series ''[[Babylon 5]]'' (1994–1998). Mumy has garnered praise from the science fiction fandom for his portrayal of these two characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes bio&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Erickson|first1=Hal|title=Bill Mumy|url=http://www.nytimes.com/movies/person/51302/Bill-Mumy/biography|accessdate=11 January 2015|work=Biography|publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voice-over career==
Mumy has narrated over 50 episodes of the [[A&amp;E Network|Arts &amp; Entertainment Channel]]'s ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'' series, as well as hosting and narrating several other documentaries and specials for A &amp; E, [[Animal Planet]] network, [[Syfy|The Sci-Fi Channel]], and [[E!]]. His voice acting talents can be heard on animated shows like ''[[Ren and Stimpy]]'', ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', [[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Animaniacs]]'', ''Little Wizard Adventures'', ''[[The Oz Kids]]'' and [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s ''[[Buzz Lightyear of Star Command]]'' and ''[[Doc McStuffins]]''. He has also been heard in dozens of national commercials for businesses such as [[Farmers Insurance Group|Farmers Insurance]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Bud Ice]], [[Blockbuster (movie rental store)|Blockbuster]], [[Twix]], [[Oscar Mayer]] and [[McDonald's]].

==Music==
Mumy is an accomplished musician who plays guitar, bass, keyboards, [[banjo]], [[mandolin]], harmonica and percussion. Among his various musical credits, he has written and recorded songs with [[America (band)|America]], toured with [[Shaun Cassidy]], and played in [[Rick Springfield]]'s band in the film ''Hard to Hold''. He also created the band [[The Be Five]] with other ''Babylon 5'' actors, and fronts another band called [[Seduction of the Innocent (band)|Seduction of the Innocent]].&lt;ref&gt;

Mumy has released a number of solo CDs, including ''Dying to Be Heard'', ''In the Current'', ''Pandora's Box'', ''After Dreams Come True'', ''Los Angeles Times'' and ''Ghosts'', as well as nine albums with partner [[Robert Haimer]] as [[Barnes and Barnes]]. Their most famous hit is the song &quot;[[Fish Heads (song)|Fish Heads]]&quot;, which was named as one of the top 100 videos of all time by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. The Jenerators are a blues-rock band based in Los Angeles, CA featuring Tom Hebenstreit on vocals, electric guitars and keyboards; Mumy on vocals, acoustic and electric guitars, harmonica, keyboards and percussion; Gary Stockdale on vocals and bass; [[Miguel Ferrer]] on vocals, percussion and drums; David Jolliffe on guitar, percussion and vocals; and Chris Ross on drums and percussion.  In 2012, Mumy released a Byrds-tribute song, &quot;When Roger Was Jim&quot;.

Mumy also produces and hosts 'The Real Good Radio Hour', a weekly series on KSAV Internet Radio focusing on various styles of music and the artists who pioneered them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ksav.org/index.php/programs/realgoodradiohour&lt;/ref&gt;

== Friendship with Jonathan Harris ==
At age 11, in 1965, Mumy began working with Jonathan Harris on ''Lost in Space'', and the two became close friends, both on and off set. He would also spend time with Harris' family when not working on &quot;Space&quot; or taking a hiatus from the show. In 1996, Mumy and Harris were reunited at a [[Walt Disney]] convention in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Florida]]. Mumy worked again with Harris on the 1998 retrospective special ''Lost In Space: Forever'', where they reprised their roles in a scene written by Mumy (with Harris rewriting his lines). This occurred the year after the rest of the cast (including both Mumy &amp; Harris) stated in a ''[[TV Guide]]'' article that the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] planned to do a ''Lost in Space'' marathon while promoting a new movie. Harris was to appear in the planned TV movie, ''Lost in Space: The Journey Home'', but died before production started in 2002; the production was subsequently cancelled. Mumy read the eulogy at Harris' funeral and was asked to narrate an account of his longtime friend's life on [[A&amp;E Biography|A&amp;E ''Biography'']] that year. During a 2010 interview on ''Blog Talk Radio'''s ''Lessons Learned'', Rick Tocquigny was asked if Mumy was a Jonathan Harris fan before they appeared together on ''Lost in Space''. Tocquigny said that at age 5, Mumy was too young to watch his mentor's show ''[[The Third Man (TV series)|The Third Man]]'' which would have been aired late at night, but that he was old enough to see ''[[The Bill Dana Show]]'' (which also starred Harris's real-life best friend [[Don Adams]]). After that, Mumy was indeed a Harris fan, having seen [[rerun]]s of ''The Third Man''. He was also a fan of [[Guy Williams (actor)|Guy Williams]], who would play his father on ''Lost in Space'', due to Williams' TV portrayals of ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blogtalkradio.com/lifelessonsnetwork/2010/09/22/bill-mumy-of-lost-in-space-fame-shares-his-life-lessons |title=Bill Mumy of Lost in Space fame shares his life lessons 09/22 by Lessons Learned |publisher=Blog Talk Radio |date=2010-09-22 |accessdate=2011-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 14, 2006, Mumy got to work with Harris one last time, though posthumously. Years before he passed away, Harris recorded voice work for the animated short [[The Bolt Who Screwed Christmas]], narrating the film and playing the part of The Bolt. As a tribute to Harris, writer director John Wardlaw added a scene to the film that reunited ''Lost in Space'' cast members Bill Mumy, [[Marta Kristen]] and [[Angela Cartwright]] as the animated Ratchett family.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/cultist/2011/07/the_bolt_who_screwed_christmas.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, eleven years after the death of Mumy's acting mentor in November 2002, Mumy commented on his connection between the familiar actor (Harris) and the unfamiliar actor's (Mumy) on- and off-screen connection on ''Lost in Space.'' &quot;Yes we did. Indeed, dear boy. Don’t you forget it.&quot; Mumy also added, &quot;Well, yeah. I never really had too many uncomfortable moments working with any actor. I was comfortable working with most everybody. It’s just the more that Jonathan and I did together, the more he changed the character. He really changed the character of Dr. Smith himself. He really turned him from a snarling saboteur villain to this bumbling insulting kook. The more he played it for comedy, the more Irwin Allen liked it. The show really went the way that Jonathan led it. But we had great chemistry together, and we never had a bad day. We were always prepared, as was Bobby May who was inside the robot. When we had our work to do—and I think this is a very big reason [for] the way it went—they’d get us done in a couple of takes. Nobody screwed up. It was easier for the crew and it was easier for us, and people seemed to like it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://popcultureaddict.com/interviews/billmumy/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
He currently lives in [[Hollywood Hills]], California, with his wife, Eileen, and their two child-actor children, [[Seth Mumy|Seth]] and [[Liliana Mumy|Liliana]]. In 1992, Mumy and [[Peter David]] co-authored the short story &quot;The Black '59&quot; in the anthology book ''Shock Rock'' by F. Paul Wilson.
