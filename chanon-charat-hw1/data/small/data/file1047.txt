'''Austin''' ({{pronunciation|En-us-Austin.oga}}) ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɒ|s|t|ɨ|n}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔː|s|t|ɨ|n}}) is the capital of the US state of [[Texas]] and the seat of [[Travis County, Texas|Travis&amp;nbsp;County]]. Located in {{nowrap|[[Central Texas]]}}, Austin is the {{nowrap|11th-most populous}} city in the United States and the {{nowrap|fourth-most populous}} city in Texas.

The city is the cultural and economic center of the  {{nowrap|[[Greater Austin|Austin–Round Rock]]}} metropolitan area, which had an estimated population of 1,883,051 as of July 1, 2013.

In the 1830s, pioneers began to settle the area in central Austin along the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]]. After [[Republic of Texas]] Vice President [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]] visited the area during a [[American bison|buffalo]]-hunting expedition between 1837 and 1838, he proposed that the republic's capital then located in [[Houston]], be relocated to the area situated on the north bank of the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]] near the present-day [[Congress Avenue Bridge]]. In 1839, the site was officially chosen as the republic's new capital (the republic's seventh and final location) and was incorporated under the name Waterloo. Shortly thereafter, the name was changed to Austin in honor of [[Stephen F. Austin]], the &quot;Father of Texas&quot; and the republic's first secretary of state.

The city grew throughout the 19th century and became a center for government and education with the construction of the [[Texas State Capitol]] and the [[University of Texas at Austin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austintexas.org/travel_trade/why_austin/historyheritage |title=History Lesson |accessdate=July 28, 2008 |publisher=Austin Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a lull in growth from the [[Great Depression]], Austin resumed its development into a major city and, by the 1980s, it emerged as a center for technology and business.&lt;ref name=&quot;austin history&quot; /&gt; A number of [[Fortune 500]] companies have headquarters or regional offices in Austin including [[Advanced Micro Devices]], [[Apple Inc.]], [[eBay]], [[Google]], [[IBM]], [[Intel]], [[Texas Instruments]], [[3M]], [[Oracle Corporation]] and [[Whole Foods Market]].&lt;ref&gt;Fortune. 2009-Apr.

==History==
{{Main|History of Austin, Texas}}
{{see also|Timeline of Austin, Texas}}
Austin, Travis County and Williamson County have been the site of human habitation since at least 9200 BC. The earliest known inhabitants of the area lived during the late [[Pleistocene]] (Ice Age) and are linked to the [[Clovis culture]] around 9200 BC (11,200 years ago), based on evidence found throughout the area and documented at the much-studied Gault Site, midway between [[Georgetown, Texas|Georgetown]] and [[Fort Hood]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tshaonline1&quot;&gt;{{cite web

When settlers first arrived from Europe, the area was inhabited by the [[Tonkawa]] tribe, and the [[Comanche]]s and [[Lipan Apache people|Lipan Apaches]] were known to travel through the area as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;historycenter5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=What Native American tribe was most common in the area? |work=Austin City Connection |publisher=City of Austin |url=http://www.cityofaustin.org/library/ahc/faq5.htm |accessdate=September 20, 2007}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish colonists, including the Espinosa-Olivares-Aguirre expedition, traveled through the area for centuries, though few permanent settlements were created for some time.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOT: Hays Co&quot;&gt;{{Handbook of Texas|name=Hays County|id=hch11|retrieved=Feb 17, 2010|author=Cecil, Paul F.; Greene, Daniel P.}} Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1730, three missions from East Texas were combined and reestablished as one mission on the south side of the Colorado River, in what is now [[Zilker Park]], in Austin.

In 1835–1836, Texans fought and won [[Texas Revolution|independence from Mexico]]. Texas thus became its own independent country with its own president, congress, and monetary system. In 1839, the Texas Congress formed a commission to seek a site for a new capital to be named for [[Stephen F. Austin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HOT: Austin&quot;/&gt; [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]], second president of the newly formed [[Republic of Texas]], advised the commissioners to investigate the area named Waterloo, noting the area's hills, waterways, and pleasant surroundings.&lt;ref name=&quot;pres1&quot;&gt;Patoski, Joe Nick &quot;It's Just Different Here&quot;, ''[[National Trust for Historic Preservation|Preservation]]'', July/August 2010, page 38&lt;/ref&gt; Waterloo was selected and the name ''Austin'' was chosen as the town's new name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Handbook of Texas|name=Waterloo, Texas|id=hvw13|retrieved=February 17, 2010}} Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt; The location was seen as a convenient crossroads for trade routes between [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and [[Galveston Bay]], as well as routes between northern Mexico and the [[Red River (Texas)|Red River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Erlichman (2006), p. 61.&quot;/&gt; Austin is also the site where the southern leg of the [[Chisholm Trail]] leads to the Colorado River.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first = Don| last = Martin|work = Austin |page = 31|year = 2009|publisher = [[Arcadia Publishing]] Chicago, IL |isbn = 978-0-7385-7067-9| postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

[[File:Old map-Austin-1873-sm.jpg|thumb|right|An 1873 illustration of Edwin Waller's layout for Austin]]
[[Edwin Waller]] was picked by Lamar to survey the village and draft a plan laying out the new capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOT: Austin&quot;/&gt; The original site was narrowed to {{convert|640|acres|0|abbr=on}} that fronted the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]] between two creeks, Shoal Creek and Waller Creek, which was later named in his honor. The 14-block grid plan was bisected by a broad north-south thoroughfare, Congress Avenue, running up from the river to Capital Square, where the new Texas State Capitol was to be constructed. A temporary one-story capitol was erected on the corner of Colorado and 8th Streets. On August 1, 1839, the first auction of 217 out of 306 lots total was held.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOT: Austin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Erlichman (2006), p. 61.&quot;&gt;Erlichman (2006), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The grid plan Waller designed and surveyed now forms the basis of downtown Austin.

In 1840, a series of conflicts between the Texas Rangers and the Comanches, known as the [[Council House Fight]] and the [[Battle of Plum Creek]], finally pushed the Comanches westward, mostly ending conflicts in Central Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Handbook of Texas|name=Plum Creek, Battle of|id=btp04|retrieved=February 17, 2010}} Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Settlement in the area began to expand quickly. Travis County was established in 1840, and the surrounding counties were mostly established within the next two decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOT:Travis Co&quot;/&gt;

Initially, the new capital thrived. But Lamar's political enemy, [[Sam Houston]], used two Mexican army incursions to [[San Antonio]] as an excuse to move the government. Sam Houston fought bitterly against Lamar's decision to establish the capital in such a remote wilderness. The men and women who traveled mainly from Houston to conduct government business were intensely disappointed as well. By 1840, the population had risen to 856, of whom nearly half fled from Austin when Congress recessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=City of Austin Community Inventory Report|url=http://www.imagineaustin.net/inventory-historic.htm|publisher=Austin City Connection|accessdate=December 11, 2009}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resident Black population listed in January of this same year was 176.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Austin Treasures: First Year Firsts: 1839.|url=http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/library/ahc/begin/firsts.htm|publisher=Austin City Connections|accessdate=April 18, 2011}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fear of Austin's proximity to the Indians and Mexico, which still considered Texas a part of their land, created an immense motive for Sam Houston, the first and third President of the Republic of Texas, to relocate the capital once again in 1841. Upon threats of Mexican troops in Texas, Houston raided the Land Office to transfer all official documents to Houston for safe keeping in what was later known as the Archive War, but the people of Austin would not allow this unaccompanied decision to be executed. The documents stayed, but the capital would temporarily move from Austin to Houston to Washington-on-the-Brazos. Without the governmental body, Austin's population declined to a low of only a few hundred people throughout the early 1840s. The voting by the fourth President of the Republic, Anson Jones, and Congress, who reconvened in Austin in 1845, settled the issue to keep Austin the seat of government as well as annex the Republic of Texas into the United States.

In September 1881, Austin public schools held their first classes. The same year, Tillotson Collegiate and Normal Institute (now part of [[Huston-Tillotson University]]) opened its doors. The [[University of Texas at Austin]] held its first classes in 1883, although classes had been held in the original wooden state Capitol for four years before.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Don (2009).

During the 1880s, Austin gained new prominence as the [[Texas State Capitol|state capitol building]] was completed in 1888 and claimed as the seventh largest building in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOT: Austin&quot;/&gt; In the late 19th century, Austin expanded its city limits to more than three times its former area, and the first granite dam was built on the Colorado River to power a new street car line and the new &quot;[[Moonlight tower|moon towers]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOT: Austin&quot;/&gt; Unfortunately, the first dam washed away in a flood on April 7, 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Don (2009).

In the 1920s and 1930s, Austin launched a series of civic development and beautification projects that created much of the city's infrastructure and many of its parks. In addition, the state legislature established the [[Lower Colorado River Authority|Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA)]] that, along with the city of Austin, created the system of dams along the Colorado River to form the Highland Lakes. These projects were enabled in large part because the [[Public Works Administration]] provided Austin with greater funding for municipal construction projects than other Texas cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOT: Austin&quot;/&gt;

During the early twentieth century, a three-way system of social segregation emerged in Austin, with Anglos, African Americans and Mexicans being separated by custom or law in most aspects of life, including housing, health care, and education. Many of the municipal improvement programs initiated during this period—such as the construction of new roads, schools, and hospitals—were deliberately designed to institutionalize this system of segregation. Racial segregation actually increased in Austin during the first half of the twentieth century, with African Americans and Mexicans experiencing high levels of discrimination and social marginalization.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Jason (2012). Racial Dynamics in Early Twentieth-Century Austin, Texas. Lexington Books. ISBN/9780739170977&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, the destroyed granite dam on the Colorado River was finally replaced by a hollow concrete dam&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Don (2009). ''Austin'', p. 111. [[Arcadia Publishing]], Chicago, IL, ISBN 978-0-7385-7067-9&lt;/ref&gt; that formed Lake McDonald (now called Lake Austin) and which has withstood all floods since. In addition, the much larger Mansfield Dam was built by the LCRA upstream of Austin to form the flood-control lake, Lake Travis.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Don (2009). ''Austin'', p. 112. [[Arcadia Publishing]], Chicago, IL, ISBN 978-0-7385-7067-9&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 20th century, the [[Texas Oil Boom]] took hold, creating tremendous economic opportunities in Southeast Texas and North Texas. The growth generated by this boom largely passed by Austin at first, with the city slipping from fourth largest to 10th largest in Texas between 1880 and 1920.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOT: Austin&quot; /&gt;

After the mid-20th century, Austin became established as one of Texas' major metropolitan centers. In 1970, the Census Bureau reported Austin's population as 14.5% Hispanic, 11.9% black, and 73.4% non-Hispanic white.&lt;ref name=&quot;census&quot; /&gt; In the late 20th century, Austin emerged as an important high tech center for semiconductors and software. The [[University of Texas at Austin]] emerged as a major university.&lt;ref name=&quot;Later 1900s&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Austin in Texas|url = http://www.writeonaustin.org/ |publisher = Writeonaustin.com |accessdate = April 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1970s saw Austin's emergence in the national music scene, with local artists such as [[Willie Nelson]], [[Asleep at the Wheel]], and [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] and iconic music venues such as the [[Armadillo World Headquarters]]. Over time, the long-running television program ''Austin City Limits'', its namesake Austin City Limits Festival, and the [[South by Southwest]] music festival solidified the city's place in the music industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;austin history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Austin |work=Austin City Connection |publisher=City of Austin |url=http://www.cityofaustin.org/library/ahc/briefhistory.htm |accessdate=December 28, 2007}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[File:Austin Texas.jpg|thumb|left|Austin as seen from the International Space Station, 2007]]

[[File:AustinTXMap.gif|thumb|City limits of Austin]]
The most southerly of the capitals of the contiguous forty-eight states, Austin is located in [[Central Texas]], along the [[Balcones Escarpment]] and [[Interstate 35]], 150 miles northwest of [[Houston]]. It is also 160 miles south of [[Dallas]] and 75 miles north of [[San Antonio]]. Its elevation varies from {{convert|425|ft|m|0}} to approximately {{convert|1000|ft|m|0}} above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott (2003), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the city occupied a total area of {{convert|271.8|sqmi|km2|0}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/citymgr/basicfac.htm |title=Austin, Texas: Basic Facts |publisher=City of Austin, Texas |accessdate=February 4, 2010}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately {{convert|6.9|sqmi|km2|0}} of this area is water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/housing/downloads/RFPMG100110500.pdf |title=City of Austin Purchasing Office: Request for Proposal (RFP): Solicitation Number: MG10011: Comprehensive Housing Market Study: Scope of Work |publisher=City of Austin, Texas |page=1 |accessdate=February 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austin is situated on the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]], with three man-made (artificial) lakes within the city limits: [[Lady Bird Lake]] (formerly known as Town Lake), [[Lake Austin]] (both created by dams along the Colorado River), and [[Lake Walter E. Long]] that is partly used for cooling water for the Decker Power Plant. [[Mansfield Dam]] and the foot of [[Lake Travis]] are located within the city's limits.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Handbook of Texas|id=hda03|name=Austin, Texas|author=Humphrey, David C.|retrieved=February 4, 2010}} Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Bird Lake, Lake Austin, and Lake Travis are each on the Colorado River.&lt;ref name=&quot;HOT: Austin&quot;/&gt; As a result of its straddling the [[Balcones Fault]], much of the eastern part of the city is flat, with heavy clay and loam soils, whereas, the western part and western suburbs consist of rolling hills on the edge of the [[Texas Hill Country]].&lt;ref&gt;Baird (2009), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the hills to the west are primarily [[limestone]] rock with a thin covering of topsoil, portions of the city are frequently subjected to flash floods from the runoff caused by thunderstorms.&lt;ref name=Handbook&gt;{{Handbook of Texas|id=ryh02|name=Hill Country|retrieved=November 7, 2009|author=[[Terry G.

The lakes also provide venues for boating, swimming, and other forms of recreation within several parks on the lake shores.&lt;ref&gt;{{Handbook of Texas|id=mwl03|name=Lower Colorado River Authority|author=McCann, William|retrieved=February 7, 2010}} Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

Austin is located at the intersection of four major ecological regions, and is consequently a temperate-to-hot green oasis with a highly variable climate having some characteristics of the desert, the tropics, and a wetter climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=|title=Birding in South Texas|publisher=Fodor's}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/images/ewx/aus/ausclisum.pdf |title=Austin Climate Summary |publisher=NOAA |accessdate=February 7, 2010}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visiting-austin-texas.com/austin-texas-weather.html |title=Austin Texas Weather Patterns |publisher=Visiting Austin Texas |accessdate=February 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area is very diverse ecologically and biologically, and is home to a variety of animals and plants.&lt;ref&gt;Vines (1984), p. 4–6.&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, the area is home to many types of wildflowers that blossom throughout the year but especially in the spring, including the popular bluebonnets, some planted in an effort by [[Lady Bird Johnson|&quot;Lady Bird&quot; Johnson]], wife of [[Lyndon B. Johnson|former President Lyndon Johnson]].&lt;ref&gt;Baird (2009), p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular point of prominence in Austin is [[Mount Bonnell]]. At about {{convert|780|ft|m|0}} above sea level, it is a natural limestone formation overlooking [[Lake Austin]] on the Colorado River, with an observation deck about {{convert|200|ft|m|0}} below its summit.

The soils of Austin range from shallow, gravelly clay loams over limestone in the western outskirts to deep, fine sandy loams, silty clay loams, silty clays or clays in the city's eastern part. Some of the clays have pronounced shrink-swell properties and are difficult to work under most moisture conditions. Many of Austin's soils, especially the clay-rich types, are slightly to moderately alkaline and have free [[calcium carbonate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbs.utexas.edu/fowler/epveg/epgeol.htm |title=Geology (Edward's Plateau Ecology) |author=Nora Fowler, School of Biological Sciences |publisher=University of Texas at Austin |accessdate=February 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Condominiums Tower]]
Buildings that make up most of Austin's skyline are modest in height and somewhat spread out. The latter characteristic is partly due to a restriction that preserves the view of the [[Texas State Capitol]] building from various locations around Austin (known as the Capitol View Corridor).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofaustin.org/downtown/downloads/CVC_Report_Final.pdf |title=Downtown Development and Capitol View Corridors |author=Downtown Commission |date=June 2007 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many new highrise towers have been constructed and the downtown area is looking more modern and dense. The city's tallest building, [[The Austonian]], was topped out on September 17, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxaustin.com/dpp/news/local/091709_Austonian_Reaches_Full_Height |title=Austonian Reaches Full Height |publisher=[[KTBC]] |accessdate=October 17, 2009}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Austin is currently undergoing a skyscraper boom, which includes recent construction on the now complete 360 Condominiums at {{convert|563|ft|m|0}}, Spring (condominiums), the Austonian at {{convert|683|ft|m|0}}, and several others that are mainly for residential use.

At night, parts of Austin are lit by &quot;artificial moonlight&quot; from [[moonlight tower|Moonlight Towers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofaustin.org/library/ahc/faq4.htm |title=Austin History Center a division of the Austin Public Library: Frequently Asked Questions about Austin, Answer 4|accessdate=July 15, 2010}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; built to illuminate the central part of the city. The {{convert|165|ft|m|sing=on}} moonlight towers were built in the late 19th century and are now recognized as historic landmarks. Only 15 of the 31 original innovative towers remain standing in Austin, and none remain in any of the other cities where they were installed. The towers are featured in the 1993 film ''[[Dazed and Confused (film)|Dazed and Confused]]''.

====Downtown====
{{Main|Downtown Austin}}
The central business district of Austin is home to some of the tallest condo towers in the state, with [[The Austonian]] topping out at 56 floors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.skyscraperpage.com/showthread.php?t=124346|title=Skyscraper Page.com|publisher=|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the tallest residential building in the U.S. west of the Mississippi River) and [[Austin 360 Condominiums Tower|360]] at 44 floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highrises.com/austin/360-austin-condos/|title=Highrise.com|publisher=|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former Mayor Will Wynn set out a goal for having up to 25,000 people living Downtown by 2015, and the city provided incentives for building residential units in the urban core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firstcallaustin.com/news3.htm |title=Booming downtown Austin condo market |work=Austin-American Statesman |date=February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, the city has been driven to increase density in Austin's urban core. The skyline has drastically changed in recent years, and the residential real estate market has remained relatively strong.
Downtown growth has been aided by the presence of a popular live music and nightlife scene, museums, restaurants, and [[Lady Bird Lake]], considered one of the city's best recreational spots.  The 2nd Street District consists of several new residential projects, restaurants, upscale boutiques and other entertainment venues, as well as Austin's City Hall.  Across 2nd Street from Austin's City Hall is the new ACL Live @ the Moody Theatre where the long-running PBS program ''Austin City Limits'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2010/02/22/daily46.html|title=New Austin City Limits home taking shape|work=[[Austin Business Journal]]|date=February 25, 2010|first=Sandra|last=Zaragoza}}&lt;/ref&gt; is filmed.

==Government and law==

===City government===
{{See also|List of mayors of Austin, Texas}}
[[File:AustinTXCityHall.JPG|thumb|Austin City Hall]]

Austin is currently administered by a seven-member [[city council]] (six council members plus a mayor), each of them elected at large. The council is accompanied by a hired [[city manager]] under the [[council-manager government|manager-council]] system of municipal governance. Council and mayoral elections are non-partisan, with a runoff in case there is no majority winner. Due to a referendum approved by voters on November 6, 2012, the current composition with council members elected on an at-large basis will change in 2014 to a new system of ten single member districts and a citywide election for mayor.

Austin formerly operated its city hall at 128 West 8th Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.swf.usace.army.mil/pubdata/notices/3oakpdf/PPN3RV1.pdf |title = Availability of FEIS |publisher = Fort Worth District [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] |accessdate = December 29, 2008| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090109125039/http://www.swf.usace.army.mil/pubdata/notices/3oakpdf/PPN3RV1.pdf| archivedate = January 9, 2009 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antoine Predock and Cotera Kolar Negrete &amp; Reed Architects designed a new city hall building, which was intended to reflect what ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' referred to as a &quot;crazy-quilt vitality, that embraces everything from country music to environmental protests and high-tech swagger.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.hunterdouglascontract.com/referenceprojects/article.jsp?pId=8a438349014db9420102a25eeb960621 |title = Austin City Hall |publisher = Hunter Douglas Contract |accessdate = December 29, 2008| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081119030748/http://www.hunterdouglascontract.com/referenceprojects/article.jsp?pId=8a438349014db9420102a25eeb960621| archivedate = November 19, 2008 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new city hall, built from recycled materials, has solar panels in its garage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Witt, Howard |title=In heart of Texas, drumbeat for green |work=Chicago Tribune |date=September 28, 2007 |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/services/newspaper/printedition/friday/chi-austin_green_wittsep28,0,2964379.story}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city hall, at 301 West Second Street, opened in November 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/cityhall/ |title=Austin City Hall |publisher=City of Austin |accessdate=December 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{As of|2009|alt=current}} mayor of Austin is [[Lee Leffingwell]].

Austin is known as an enclave of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] politics in a generally conservative state—so much so, that the city is sometimes sarcastically called the &quot;People's Republic of Austin&quot; by residents of other parts of Texas, and conservatives in the Texas Legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0CE3D71338F931A25752C1A9669C8B63 |title=COUNTING THE VOTE: THE SCENE; In Austin, the Jockeying, Along With the Partying, Is on Hold |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |last=Verhovek |first=Sam Howe |date=November 12, 2000 |accessdate=January 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;welsh1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/07/17/america/Texas-Dem-Rebound.php |title = Texas Democrats look to Obama to help them rebound |last = Welsh-Huggins |first = Andrew |date = July 17, 2008 |accessdate = January 7, 2009| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090212202924/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/07/17/america/Texas-Dem-Rebound.php| archivedate = February 12, 2009 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the major party realignment that began in the 1970s, central Austin became a stronghold of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], while the suburbs tend to vote [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]. A controversial turning point in the political history of the Austin area was the [[2003 Texas redistricting]]. Opponents characterized the resulting district layout as excessively partisan [[gerrymandering]], and the plan was challenged in court by Democratic and minority activists; of note, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has never struck down a redistricting plan for being excessively partisan. The plan was subsequently upheld by a three-judge federal panel in late 2003, and on June 28, 2006, the matter was largely settled when the Supreme Court, in a 7–2 decision, upheld the entire congressional redistricting plan with the exception of a Hispanic-majority district in southwest Texas. This affected Austin's districting, as U.S. Rep. [[Lloyd Doggett]]'s district (U.S. Congressional District 25) was found to be insufficiently compact to compensate for the reduced [[minority influence]] in the southwest district; it was redrawn so that it now takes in most of southeastern Travis County and several counties to its south and east.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Greg |last=Stohr |title=Republican Texas Redistricting Upheld by Top Court |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=ah1suoNgrH7g&amp;refer=us |publisher=Bloomberg  |date=June 28, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the city is a blend of downtown liberalism and suburban conservatism but leans to the political left as a whole. The city last went to a Republican candidate in 2000 when Texan resident George W. Bush successfully ran for President.  This was helped in part by Ralph Nader of the Green Party splitting the center-left vote by winning a sizeable 10.4%, which was largely at the expense of the Democrats. In 2004, the Democrats rebounded strongly as John Kerry enjoyed a 14.0% margin over Bush, who once again won Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/vote2004/countymap.htm |title=Latest vote, county by county |date=November 16, 2004 |work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the city adopted a resolution against the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] that reaffirmed constitutionally guaranteed rights.  Of Austin's six state legislative districts, three are strongly Democratic and three are swing districts, two of which are held by Democrats and one of which is held by a Republican. However, two of its three congressional districts (the [[Texas's 10th congressional district|10th]] and the [[Texas's 21st congressional district|21st]]) are presently held by Republicans, with only the [[Texas's 25th congressional district|25th]] held by a Democrat. This is largely due to the 2003 redistricting, which left downtown Austin without an exclusive congressional seat of its own. Travis County was also the only county in Texas to reject Texas Constitutional Amendment Proposition 2 that effectively outlawed gay marriage and status equal or similar to it and did so by a wide margin (40% for, 60% against).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.co.travis.tx.us/county_clerk/election/20051108/enight_results.pdf |title = November 8, 2005 Joint Special Elections |publisher = [[Travis County, Texas]] |date = November 8, 2005 |format = PDF |accessdate = October 19, 2008| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081028224014/http://www.co.travis.tx.us/county_clerk/election/20051108/enight_results.pdf| archivedate = October 28, 2008 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=311361 |title=Austin – the Only Gay Place |last=Nichols |first=Lee |work=[[The Austin Chronicle]] |date=November 18, 2005 |accessdate=October 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlo/79R/billtext/HJ00006F.HTM |title = 79(R) HJR 6 – Enrolled version – Bill Text |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051125072148/http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/tlo/79R/billtext/HJ00006F.HTM |archivedate = November 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the candidates for president in the 2004 race called Austin home. Michael Badnarik, the Libertarian Party candidate, and [[David Cobb]] of the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] both had lived in Austin. During the run up to the election in November, a presidential debate was held at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] student union involving the two minor party candidates. While the [[Commission on Presidential Debates]] only invites Democrats and Republicans to participate in televised debates, the debate at UT was open to all presidential candidates. Austin also hosted one of the last presidential debates between [[Barack Obama]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] during their heated race for the Democratic nomination in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/02/21/debate.main/index.html |title = Obama, Clinton Agree to Disagree |accessdate = June 16, 2009 |work = CNN Politics.com |publisher = CNN | date = February 22, 2008| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090609135224/http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/02/21/debate.main/index.html| archivedate = June 9, 2009 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2012 Presidential election, Travis County, which contains the majority of Austin, voted to re-elect President Barack H. Obama (D) by a 24-point margin (60.1% to 36.2%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.traviscountyclerk.org/eclerk/content/images/election_results/2012.11.06/Official/20121106tccume.pdf ]{{dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Environmental movement====
The distinguishing political movement of Austin politics has been that of the environmental movement, which spawned the parallel neighborhood movement, then the more recent conservationist movement (as typified by the Hill Country Conservancy),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Conservancy shifts into high gear; Efforts steer land away from development |first=Sara |last=Zaragosa |newspaper=Austin Business Journal |date=August 28, 2009 |url=http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2009/08/31/story4.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually the current ongoing debate about &quot;sense of place&quot; and preserving the Austin quality of life. Much of the so-called environmental movement has matured into a debate on issues related to saving and creating an Austin &quot;sense of place.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Environmental City |last = Swearingen, Jr. |first = William |publisher = [[University of Texas Press]] |location = Austin, Texas |isbn = 978-0-292-72181-4 |pages = 18, 19 |url = http://www.utexaspress.com |accessdate = July 25, 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100620021354/http://www.utexaspress.com/| archivedate = June 20, 2010 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Highways===
{{See also|List of highways in Travis County, Texas}}
[[File:Pennybacker Bridge View.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Pennybacker Bridge]] is the signature element of [[Texas Loop 360|Loop 360]] in the [[Texas Hill Country]].]]
Central Austin lies between two major north-south freeways: [[Interstate 35 in Texas|Interstate 35]] to the east and the [[State Highway Loop 1 (Texas)|Mopac Expressway (Loop 1)]] to the west. [[U.S. Highway 183 (Texas)|U.S. Highway 183]] runs from northwest to southeast, and [[State Highway 71 (Texas)|State Highway 71]] crosses the southern part of the city from east to west, completing a rough &quot;box&quot; around central and north-central Austin. Austin is the largest city in the United States to be served by only one Interstate Highway.

[[U.S. Highway 290 (Texas)|U.S. Highway 290]] enters Austin from the east and merges into Interstate 35. Its highway designation continues south on I-35 and then becomes part of Highway 71, continuing to the west. Highway 290 splits from Highway 71 in southwest Austin, in an interchange known as &quot;The Y.&quot; Highway 71 continues to [[Brady, Texas]], and Highway 290 continues west to intersect [[Interstate 10 in Texas|Interstate 10]] near [[Junction, Texas|Junction]]. Interstate 35 continues south through [[San Antonio]] to [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] on the Texas-Mexico border. Interstate 35 is the highway link to the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex in northern Texas. There are two links to Houston, Texas (Highway 290 and State Highway 71/Interstate 10). Highway 183 leads northwest of Austin toward [[Lampasas, Texas|Lampasas]].

In the mid-1980s, construction was completed on [[State Highway Loop 360 (Texas)|Loop 360]], a scenic highway that curves through the hill country from near the 71/Mopac interchange in the south to near the 183/Mopac interchange in the north. The iconic [[Pennybacker Bridge]], also known as the &quot;360 Bridge&quot;, crosses [[Lake Austin]] to connect the northern and southern portions of Loop 360.

===Tollways===
[[File:Texas45.jpg|thumb|right|Interchange of [[Interstate 35 in Texas|Interstate 35]] and [[State Highway 45 (Texas)|State Highway 45]].]]
[[State Highway 130 (Texas)|State Highway 130]] is a bypass route designed to relieve traffic congestion, starting from [[Interstate 35]] just north of Georgetown and running along a parallel route to the east, where it bypasses [[Round Rock, Texas|Round Rock]], Austin, [[San Marcos, Texas|San Marcos]] and [[New Braunfels, Texas|New Braunfels]] before ending at [[Interstate 10]] east of [[Seguin, Texas|Seguin]], where drivers could drive {{convert|30|mi|km}} west to return to Interstate 35 in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]]. The first segment was opened in November 2006, which was located east of [[Austin–Bergstrom International Airport]] at Austin's southeast corner on [[State Highway 71 (Texas)|State Highway 71]].  Highway 130 runs concurrently with Highway 45 from [[Pflugerville, Texas|Pflugerville]] on the north until it reaches [[US Highway 183|US 183]] well south of Austin, where it splits off and goes west.  The entire route of State Highway 130 is now complete with last leg, which opened on November 1, 2012. The highway is noted for having the entire route with a speed limit of at least {{convert|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The 41-mile section of the toll road between Mustang Ridge and Seguin has a posted speed limit of {{convert|85|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, the highest posted [[speed limits in the United States|speed limit in the United States]].

[[State Highway 45 (Texas)|State Highway 45]] runs east-west from just south of Highway 183 in [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]] to 130 inside [[Pflugerville, Texas|Pflugerville]] (just east of Round Rock). A tolled extension of State Highway Loop 1 was also created. A new southeast leg of Highway 45 has recently been completed, running from US 183 and the south end of Segment 5 of TX-130 south of Austin due west to I-35 at the [[FM 1327]]/Creedmoor exit between the south end of Austin and [[Buda, Texas|Buda]]. The 183A Toll Road opened March 2007, providing a tolled alternative to U.S. 183 through the cities of [[Leander, Texas|Leander]] and [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]]. Currently under construction is a change to East US 290 from US 183 to the town of Manor.  Officially, the tollway will be dubbed Tollway 290 with the Manor Expressway as a nickname.
Despite the overwhelming initial opposition to the toll road concept when it was first announced, all three toll roads have exceeded revenue projections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Toll Road Revenue&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| first = Ben | last = Wear | title = Positive signs for financial future of Texas 130; | date = September 28, 2009 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AASB&amp;p_theme=aasb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_hidethis=no&amp;p_field_label-0=Author&amp;p_text_label-0=Ben%20Wear&amp;p_field_label-1=title&amp;p_bool_label-1=AND&amp;s_dispstring=Toll%20revenue%20exceed%20AND%20byline(Ben%20Wear)%20AND%20date(09/01/2009%20to%2001/01/2010)&amp;p_field_date-0=YMD_date&amp;p_params_date-0=date:B,E&amp;p_text_date-0=09/01/2009%20to%2001/01/2010)&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(Toll%20revenue%20exceed)&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no | work = Austin American-Statesman | pages = B–1 | accessdate = August 7, 2010 | quote = Report on the tollway...has been making more money than projected.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airports===
Austin's airport is [[Austin–Bergstrom International Airport]] (ABIA) ([[List of airports by IATA code: A#AU|IATA code]] '''AUS'''), located {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} southeast of the city. The airport is on the site of the former [[Bergstrom Air Force Base]], which was closed in 1993 as part of the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] process. Previously, [[Robert Mueller Municipal Airport]] was the commercial airport of Austin. [[Austin Executive Airport]] serves the general aviation coming into the city, as well as other smaller airports outside of the city centre.

===Intercity bus service===
[[Greyhound Lines]] operates the Austin Station at 916 East Koenig Lane, just east of Airport Boulevard and adjacent to [[Highland Mall]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.greyhound.com/home/TicketCenter/en/terminal.asp?city=680174 Austin, Texas].&quot; ''[[Greyhound Lines]]''.

===Public transportation===
{{See also|Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority}}
[[File:Austin Metrorail.jpg|thumb|Austin Metrorail train at Downtown Station.]]

Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority [[Capital Metro]] provides public transportation to the city, primarily by bus. Capital Metro is planning to change some routes to &quot;Rapid Lines.&quot;  The lines will feature {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}} long, train-like, high-tech buses.  This addition is going to be implemented to help reduce congestion.  Capital Metro opened a {{convert|32|mi|km|adj=on}} [[regional rail|commuter rail]] system known as [[Capital MetroRail]] on March 22, 2010.&lt;ref name=CapMetroRail&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allsystemsgo.capmetro.org/capital-metrorail-qa.shtml |title=All Systems Go Long-Range Transit Plan |publisher=Capital Metro |accessdate=April 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The system was built on existing freight rail lines and serves downtown Austin, East Austin, North Central Austin, Northwest Austin, and Leander in its first phase.  Future expansion could include a line to Manor and another to Round Rock.  [[Capital Metro]] is also looking into a light rail system to connect most of Downtown, the University of Texas at Austin, and the {{convert|700|acre|km2|sing=on}} [[Mueller Community|Mueller Airport Redevelopment]]. The light rail system would help connect the MetroRail line to key destinations in Central Austin.  On August 7, 2014, the Austin City Council unanimously voted to place a $600 million light rail bond proposal on the November 4, 2014 ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://impactnews.com/austin-metro/central-austin/austin-city-council-puts-road-and-rail-bond-on-ballot/|title=Austin City Council puts rail bond on ballot|work=Community Impact Newspaper|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Implementation of this package is contingent on matching funding from Federal transit grants.  If Federal funding is available, then Austin would begin construction of a light rail line that would run from Riverside Drive to the Highland Austin Community College Campus.  An [[Amtrak]] ''[[Texas Eagle]]'' [[Austin (Amtrak station)|station]] is located west of downtown. Segments of the Amtrak route between Austin and San Antonio are under evaluation for a future regional passenger rail corridor as an alternative to the traffic congestion of Interstate 35.
