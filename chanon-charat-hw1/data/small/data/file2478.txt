{{DISPLAYTITLE:Big Brother (''Nineteen Eighty-Four'')}}[[File:Telescreen.png|thumb|right|350px|Big Brother's face looms from giant telescreens in Victory Square in [[Michael Radford]]'s [[Nineteen Eighty-Four (film)|1984 film adaptation]] of [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.]]

'''Big Brother''' is a fictional character or symbol in [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. He is claimed to be the leader (either the actual enigmatic dictator or perhaps a symbolic [[figurehead]]) of [[Oceania (1984)|Oceania]], a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] state wherein the ruling Party wields total power &quot;for its own sake&quot; over the inhabitants.

In the society that Orwell describes, every citizen is under constant [[surveillance]] by the authorities, mainly by [[telescreen]]s (with the exception of the [[Proles]]). The people are constantly reminded of this by the phrase &quot;Big Brother is watching you&quot;, the maxim ubiquitous on display. The term &quot;Big Brother&quot; has entered the [[lexicon]] as a synonym for abuse of government power, particularly in respect to [[civil liberties]], often specifically related to [[mass surveillance]].

==Purported origins==
In the essay section of his novel ''[[1985 (Anthony Burgess novel)|1985]]'', [[Anthony Burgess]] states that Orwell got the idea for Big Brother from advertising billboards for educational [[correspondence course]]s from a company called ''Bennett's'', current during [[World War II]]. The original posters showed J. M. Bennett himself: a kindly-looking old man offering guidance and support to would-be students with the phrase &quot;Let me be your father&quot; attached. According to Burgess, after Bennett's death, his son took over the company, and the posters were replaced with pictures of the son (who looked imposing and stern in contrast to his father's kindly demeanour) with the text &quot;Let me be your big brother.&quot;

Additional speculation from Douglas Kellner of [[UCLA]] argued that Big Brother represents [[Joseph Stalin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/index.html Douglas Kellner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/essays/from1984toonedimensional.pdf From 1984 to One-Dimensional Man: Critical Reflections on Orwell and Marcuse]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=_Brother_(Nineteen_Eighty-Four|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Big_Brother_(Nineteen_Eighty-Four}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearance in the novel==

===Existence===
In the novel, it is never made totally clear whether Big Brother is or had been a real person, or was simply a creation by [[Ingsoc|the Party]] to personify itself. 

In Party propaganda, Big Brother is presented as one of the founders of the Party, along with [[Emmanuel Goldstein|Goldstein]]. At one point, Winston Smith, the protagonist of Orwell's novel, tries &quot;to remember in what year he had first heard mention of Big Brother. He thought it must have been at some time in the sixties, but it was impossible to be certain. In the Party histories, of course, Big Brother figured as the leader and guardian of the Revolution since its very earliest days. His exploits had been gradually pushed backwards in time until already they extended into the fabulous world of the forties and the thirties, when the capitalists in their strange cylindrical hats still rode through the streets of London...&quot; In the year 1984, Big Brother appears on posters and telescreens as a handsome man in his mid-40s, but he may be long dead, if he ever existed at all.

In the book ''The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism'', read by Winston Smith and purportedly written by Goldstein, Big Brother is referred to as infallible and all-powerful. No-one has ever seen him and there is a reasonable certainty that he will never die. He is simply &quot;the guise in which the Party chooses to exhibit itself to the world&quot;, since the emotions of love, fear and reverence are more easily focussed on an individual (if only a face on the hoardings and a voice on the telescreens), than an organisation.  When Winston Smith is later arrested, [[O'Brien (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|O'Brien]] repeats that Big Brother will never die. When Smith asks if Big Brother exists, O'Brien describes him as &quot;the embodiment of the Party&quot; and says that he will exist as long as the Party exists.  When Winston asks &quot;Does Big Brother exist the same way I do?&quot; (meaning is Big Brother an actual human being), O'Brien replies &quot;You do not exist&quot; (meaning that Smith is now an [[unperson]]; an example of [[doublethink]]).

===Cult of personality===
A spontaneous ritual of devotion to Big Brother (&quot;BB&quot;) is illustrated at the end of the &quot;[[Two Minutes Hate]]&quot;:

{{quote|
At this moment the entire group of people broke into a deep, slow, rhythmic chant of 'B-B! .... B-B! .... B-B!'—over and over again, very slowly, with a long pause between the first 'B' and the second—a heavy murmurous sound, somehow curiously savage, in the background of which one seemed to hear the stamps of naked feet and the throbbing of tom-toms.  For perhaps as much as thirty seconds they kept it up.  It was a refrain that was often heard in moments of overwhelming emotion.  Partly it was a sort of hymn to the wisdom and majesty of Big Brother, but still more it was an act of self-hypnosis, a deliberate drowning of consciousness by means of rhythmic noise.&lt;ref&gt;Orwell, George (1949). Nineteen Eighty-Four.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Though Oceania's [[Ministry of Truth]], [[Ministry of Plenty]], and [[Ministry of Peace]] each have names with meanings deliberately opposite to their real purpose, the [[Ministry of Love]] is perhaps the most straightforward: &quot;rehabilitated thought criminals&quot; leave the Ministry as loyal subjects who have been [[brainwashing|brainwashed]] into adoring Big Brother.

==Legacy==
{{Global surveillance}}
Since the publication of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' the phrase &quot;Big Brother&quot; has come into common use to describe any prying or overly-controlling authority figure, and attempts by government to increase surveillance.

Ukrainian-American comedian [[Yakov Smirnoff]] makes frequent reference to both Big Brother and other [[Orwellian]] traits in his [[Russian Reversal]] jokes.

The magazine ''Book'' ranked Big Brother No. 59 on its 100 Best Characters in Fiction Since 1900&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christine Paik |url=http://www.npr.org/programs/totn/features/2002/mar/020319.characters.html |title=100 Best Fictional Characters Since 1900 |publisher=NPR |date=2002-03-19 |accessdate=2013-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; list. ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine rated him the 75th greatest villain of all time.&lt;ref&gt;''Wizard'' #177&lt;/ref&gt;

The worldwide reality television show ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'' is based on the novel's concept of people being under constant [[surveillance]]. In 2000, after the [[Big Brother (U.S.)|U.S. version]] of the [[CBS]] program &quot;Big Brother&quot; premiered, the Estate of George Orwell sued CBS and its production company &quot;Orwell Productions, Inc.&quot; in federal court in Chicago for copyright and trademark infringement. The case was ''Estate of Orwell v. CBS'', 00-c-5034 (ND Ill). On the eve of trial, the case settled worldwide to the parties' &quot;mutual satisfaction&quot;; the amount that CBS paid to the Orwell Estate was not disclosed. CBS had not asked the Estate for permission. Under current laws the novel will remain under [[copyright]] protection until 2020 in the European Union and until 2044 in the United States.

The iconic image of Big Brother (played by David Graham) played a key role in [[Apple Computers|Apple]]'s [[1984 (advertisement)|1984 television commercial]] introducing the [[Macintosh]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com/news/remembering-the-1984-super-bowl-mac-ad/263647 Remembering the '1984' Super Bowl Mac ad] ZDNet, 23 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/technology/2009/09/iconic_apple_ad_gets_doubletwi.html Apple's 'Big Brother' sequel] BBC News, 30 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Orwell Estate viewed the Apple commercial as a copyright infringement, and sent a cease-and-desist letter to Apple and its advertising agency. The commercial was never televised again.&lt;ref&gt;William R. Coulson [http://www.dartmouthlawjournal.org/articles/106-115.pdf ‘Big Brother’ is watching Apple: The truth about the Super Bowl's most famous ad] The Dartmouth Law Journal, 25 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent (now posthumous) ads featuring Steve Jobs (for a variety of products including audio books) have mimicked the format and appearance of that original ad campaign, with the appearance of Steve Jobs nearly identical to that of Big Brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nick |last= Farrell |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1558044/steve-jobs-big-brother |title=Steven Jobs is the new Big Brother |publisher= the Inquirer |date=9 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last= Gianatasio |url=http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/steve-jobs-once-again-cast-big-brother-11810 |title=Steve Jobs (once again) cast as Big Brother |publisher= AdWeek |date=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the Simpsons animated television series spoofed the Apple Big Brother commercial in an episode entitled &quot;Mypods and Boomsticks.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=MG |last= Siegler |url=http://venturebeat.com/2008/12/01/the-simpsons-apple-spoof-likely-has-many-wondering-what-a-mycube-is/ |title=The Simpsons Apple spoof likely has many wondering what a &quot;myCube&quot; is |publisher= VentureBeat |date=1 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The December 2002 issue of ''[[Gear (magazine)|Gear]]'' magazine featured a story about technologies and trends that could violate personal privacy moving society closer to a &quot;Big Brother&quot; state and utilised a recreation of the movie poster&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dallmeierart.com/user/cimage/244493fb0.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; from the film version of ''1984'' created by Dallmeierart.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallmeierart.com/bigbrother.htm Big Brother is Watching You – George Orwell 1984 Movie Prop Print DallmeierArt.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

It would appear George Orwell was correct with his vision of ''Big Brother'', in his novel '1984' published in 1949 (although he may have got his predicted year 1984 slightly wrong) as can be seen in a ''London Evening Standard'' article published in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.standard.co.uk/news/george-orwell-big-brother-is-watching-your-house-7086271.html&lt;/ref&gt;
