'''Barnabas''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Βαρνάβας}}), born '''Joseph''', was an [[early Christian]], one of the earliest [[Disciple (Christianity)|Christian disciples]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name = &quot;Barnabas&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris names him as a &quot;prominent leader&quot; of the early church in Jerusalem. [[Stephen L Harris|Harris, Stephen L.]], Understanding the Bible. Palo Alto: Mayfield. 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; According to {{bibleverse||Acts|4:36}} Barnabas was a [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] [[Jew]]. Named an [[Twelve Apostles|apostle]] in {{bibleverse||Acts|14:14}}, he and [[Paul the Apostle]] undertook missionary journeys together and defended [[Gentile]] converts against the [[Judaizers]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Barnabas&quot;/&gt; They traveled together making more converts (''c'' 45-47), and participated in the [[Council of Jerusalem]] (''c'' 50).&lt;ref name=&quot;CC&quot;&gt;[[Will Durant|Durant, Will]].

Barnabas' story appears in the [[Acts of the Apostles]], and Paul mentions him in some of his [[epistle]]s.&lt;ref name = &quot;Barnabas&quot;&gt;&quot;Barnabas.&quot; Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church.

L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clement of Alexandria]] and some scholars have ascribed the [[Epistle of Barnabas]] to him, but his authorship is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Epistle of Barnabas.&quot; Cross, F.

EarlyChristianWritings.com. Retrieved: 24 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the date, place, and circumstances of his death are historically unverifiable, Christian tradition holds that Barnabas was [[martyr]]ed at [[Salamis, Cyprus]], in 61 AD.&lt;ref name = &quot;Barnabas&quot;/&gt; He is traditionally identified as the founder of the [[Cypriot Orthodox Church]]. The [[feast day]] of Barnabas is celebrated on June 11.&lt;ref name = &quot;Barnabas&quot;/&gt;

Barnabas is usually identified as the cousin of [[Mark the Evangelist]] on the basis of Colossians 4.&lt;ref&gt;Mark: Images of an Apostolic Interpreter p55 C. Clifton Black - 2009 &quot;infrequent occurrence in the Septuagint (Num 36:11; Tob 7:2) to its presence in Josephus (JW 1.662; Ant 1.290, 15.250) and Philo (On the Embassy to Gaius 67), anepsios consistently carries the connotation of &quot;cousin,&quot; though ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Some traditions hold that [[Aristobulus of Britannia]], one of the [[Seventy Disciples]], was the brother of Barnabas.

== Name and etymologies ==
His [[Greeks|Hellenic]] [[Jewish]] parents called him Joseph (although the [[Byzantine text-type]] calls him {{lang|grc|Ιὠσης}}, ''Iōsēs'', 'Joses', a [[Greek language|Greek]] variant of 'Joseph'), but when he sold all his goods and gave the money to the apostles in [[Jerusalem]], they gave him a new name: Barnabas. This name appears to be from the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] {{lang|arc|בר נביא}}, ''{{transl|sem|bar naḇyā}}'', meaning 'the son (of the) prophet'. However, the Greek text of the {{Bibleref2|Acts|4:36}} explains the name as {{lang|grc|υἱός παρακλήσεως}}, ''hyios paraklēseōs'', meaning ''&quot;son of consolation&quot; or &quot;son of encouragement&quot;.'' A similar link between ”prophecy” and ”encouragement” is found in Paul’s letter to the Corinthians ({{Bibleref2|1 Corinthians|14:3}}).

== Biblical narrative ==
[[File:St-barnabé-veronese-rouen.jpg|thumb|right|''Barnabas curing the sick'' by [[Paolo Veronese]], [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen]].]]
Barnabas appears mainly in ''Acts'', a Christian history of the early Christian church. He also appears in several of Paul's epistles.

Barnabas, a native of Cyprus and a Levite, is first mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles as a member of the early Christian community in Jerusalem who sold some land that he owned and gave the proceeds to the community (Acts 4:36-37). When the future [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]] returned to Jerusalem after his conversion, Barnabas took him and introduced him to the apostles (9:27). Easton, in his Bible Dictionary, supposes that they had been fellow students in the school of Rabbi [[Gamaliel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/easton/ebd2.html?term=Barnabas &quot;Barnabas&quot;, Easton, Matthew George, ''Eastons's Bible Dictionary'', (new and revised edition),(1897), T. Nelson and Sons]&lt;/ref&gt;

The successful preaching of Christianity at Antioch to non-Jews led the church at Jerusalem to send Barnabas there to oversee the movement (Acts 11:20–22). He found the work so extensive and weighty that he went to [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] in search of Paul (still referred to as Saul), &quot;an admirable colleague&quot;, to assist him.&lt;ref&gt;[[F.F. Bruce]], ''New Testament History'', p. 233, New York: Doubleday, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Paul returned with him to Antioch and labored with him for a whole year (Acts 11:25–26). At the end of this period, the two were sent up to Jerusalem (&lt;small&gt;AD&lt;/small&gt; 44) with contributions from the church at Antioch for the relief of the poorer Christians in Judea.

Later, they were appointed missionaries and, taking [[John Mark]] with them, went to Cyprus and some of the principal cities of [[Pamphylia]], [[Pisidia]], and [[Lycaonia]] (Acts 13:14). After recounting that the governor of Cyprus [[Sergius Paulus]] believed, the Acts of the Apostles  13:9 speaks of Barnabas's companion no longer as Saul, but as Paul, his Roman name, and generally refers to the two no longer as &quot;Barnabas and Saul&quot; as heretofore (11:30; 12:25; 13:2, 7), but as  &quot;Paul and Barnabas&quot; (13:43, 46, 50; 14:20; 15:2, 22, 35); only in 14:14 and 15:12, 25 does Barnabas again occupy the first place, in the first passage with recollection of 14:12, in the last two, because Barnabas stood in closer relation to the Jerusalem church than Paul. Paul appears as the more eloquent missionary (13:16; 14:8-9, 19-20), whence the [[Lystra]]ns regarded him as [[Hermes]], Barnabas as [[Zeus]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.covenantseminary.edu/worldwide/en/CC310/CC310_T_14.html Covenantseminary.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The King James Version renders the Greek name &quot;Zeus&quot; by the Latin name &quot;[[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; (14:12). Returning from this first missionary journey to Antioch, they were again sent up to Jerusalem to consult with the church there regarding the relation of Gentiles to the church (Acts 15:2; {{Bibleref2|Galatians|2:1}}). According to Gal. 2:9-10, Barnabas was included with Paul in the agreement made between them, on the one hand, and [[James the Just|James]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and [[John the Apostle|John]], on the other, that the two former should in the future preach to the pagans, not forgetting the poor at Jerusalem. This matter having been settled, they returned again to Antioch, bringing the agreement of the [[Council of Jerusalem|council]] that [[Gentiles]] were to be admitted into the church  without taking on Jewish practices.

After they had returned to Antioch from the Jerusalem council and after spending some time there (15:35), Paul asked Barnabas to accompany him on another journey (15:36). Barnabas wished to take [[John Mark]] along, but Paul did not, as he had left them on the former journey (15:37-38). The dispute ended by Paul and Barnabas taking separate routes. Paul took [[Silas]] as his companion, and journeyed through Syria and [[Cilicia]]; while Barnabas took [[John Mark]] to visit Cyprus (15:36-41). According to [[Hippolytus of Rome]], [[John Mark]] is not [[Mark the Cousin of Barnabas]], and Barnabas did not dispute with Paul because of personal favor to a blood relative, but due to his character as his nickname Barnabas (&quot;Son of Encouragement&quot;) indicates.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Barnabas is not mentioned again in the [[Acts of the Apostles]]. However, Gal. 2:11-13 says, &quot;And when Kephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face because he clearly was wrong. For, until some people came from James, he used to eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he began to draw back and separated himself, because he was afraid of the circumcised. And the rest of the Jews (also) acted hypocritically along with him, with the result that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy.&quot; Barnabas is also mentioned in the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians]], in which it is mentioned that he and Paul funded their missions by working side jobs and (it is implied) went without some of the benefits other apostles received, such as female companionship or food and drink (1 Cor. 9:6); Paul states that he and Barnabas forsook those benefits &quot;that we may cause no hindrance to the Good News of Christ&quot; (1 Cor. 9:12).

== Barnabas and Antioch ==
[[Antioch]], the third-most important city of the Roman Empire,&lt;ref&gt;Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005, article ''Antioch''&lt;/ref&gt; then the capital city of [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria province]], today [[Antakya]], Turkey, was where Christians were first called thus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Acts|11:26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some of those who had been scattered by the persecution that arose because of Stephen went to Antioch, which became the site of an early Christian community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01570a.htm Arbez, Edward. &quot;Antioch.&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 2 Dec. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; A considerable minority of the Antioch church of Barnabas's time belonged to the merchant class, and they provided support to the poorer Jerusalem church.&lt;ref name=&quot;CC&quot;/&gt;

== Council of Jerusalem ==
{{Main|Council of Jerusalem}}
Barnabas participated in the Council of Jerusalem, which dealt with the admission of gentiles into the Christian community, a crucial problem in early Christianity.&lt;ref name=&quot;CC&quot;/&gt; Paul and Barnabas proposed that gentiles be allowed into the community without being [[Circumcision controversy in early Christianity|circumcised]].

== Martyrdom ==
{{Main|Christian martyrs}}
Church tradition developed outside of the canon of the New Testament describes the martyrdom of many saints, including the legend of the martyrdom of Barnabas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barnabas&quot;/&gt; It relates that certain Jews coming to Syria and Salamis, where Barnabas was then preaching the gospel, being highly exasperated at his extraordinary success, fell upon him as he was disputing in the synagogue, dragged him out, and, after the most inhumane [[torture]]s, stoned him to death. His kinsman, John Mark, who was a spectator of this barbarous action, privately interred his body.&lt;ref name=PFS&gt;&quot;The Life of our Blessed Lord and Savior Jesus Christ: And the Lives and Sufferings of His Holy Evangelists and Apostles,&quot; p.455, 1857 AD, Miller, Orton &amp; Co., 25 Park Row, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is believed he was martyred of faith by being stoned, the Catholic-Apocryphal [[Acts of Barnabas]] states that he was bounded with a rope by the neck, and then being dragged only to the site where he would be burned to death. This is highly unlikely since the apocryphal Acts states that his bones were burnt to dust and that relics of some of his bones are stored in a church today; on the other hand, the fire in the apocryphal Acts could have cremated only some of his bones.

According to the History of the Cyprus Church,&lt;ref&gt;Church of Cyprus, History of Cyprus Church, The Autocephaly of the Cyprus Church [http://www.churchofcyprus.org.cy/article.php?articleID=92 churchofcyprus.org]&lt;/ref&gt; in 478 Barnabas appeared in a dream to the Archbishop of Constantia ([[Salamis, Cyprus]]) Anthemios and revealed to him the place of his sepulchre beneath a [[carob]]-tree. The following day Anthemios found the tomb and inside it the remains of Barnabas with a manuscript of Matthew's Gospel on his breast. Anthemios presented the Gospel to Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] at [[Constantinople]] and received from him the privileges of the [[Cypriot Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox Church of Cyprus]], that is, the purple cloak which the [[List of archbishops of Cyprus|Greek Archbishop of Cyprus]] wears at festivals of the church, the imperial sceptre and the red ink with which he affixes his signature.

Anthemios then placed the venerable remains of Barnabas in a church which he founded near the tomb. Excavations near the site of a present day church and monastery, have revealed an early church with two empty tombs, believe to be that of St. Barnabas and Anthemios.&lt;ref&gt;Cyprus Commemorative Stamp issue: 1900th Death Anniversary of Apostle Barnabas, [http://www.philatelism.com/details.php?issueid=22 philatelism.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Barnabas is venerated as the [[Patron Saint]] of [[Cyprus]].

==Other sources==
Although many assume that the biblical [[Mark the Cousin of Barnabas]] ([[Colossians]] 4:10) is the same as [[John Mark]] (Acts 12:12, 25; 13:5, 13; 15: 37) and [[Mark the Evangelist]], the traditionally believed author of the [[Gospel of Mark]], according to [[Hippolytus of Rome]],&lt;ref&gt;Ante-Nicean Fathers, ed. Alexander Roberts, James Donaldson and A. Cleaveland Coxe, vol. 5 (Peabody MA: Hendrickson Publishers, 1999), 255-6&lt;/ref&gt; the three &quot;Mark&quot;s are distinct persons. They were all members of the [[Seventy Disciples|Seventy Apostles of Christ]], including Barnabas himself. There are two people named Barnabas among Hippolytus' list of Seventy Disciples, one (#13) became the bishop of Milan, the other (#25) the bishop of Heraclea. Most likely one of these two is the biblical Barnabas; the first one is more likely, because the numbering by Hippolytus seems to indicate a level of significance. [[Clement of Alexandria]] (''Stromata'', ii, 20) also makes Barnabas one of the [[Seventy Disciples]] that are mentioned in the [[Gospel of Luke]] 10:1ff.

Other sources bring Barnabas to [[Rome]] and [[Alexandria, Egypt|Alexandria]]. In the [[Clementine literature|&quot;Clementine Recognitions&quot;]] (i, 7) he is depicted as preaching in Rome even during Christ's lifetime.

Not older than the 3rd century is the tradition of the later activity and martyrdom of Barnabas in [[Cyprus]], where his remains are said to have been discovered under the Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]]. The [[Cypriot Orthodox Church|Cypriot Church]] claimed Barnabas as its founder in order to rid itself of the supremacy of the [[Patriarch of Antioch]], as did the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan|Archbishop of Milan]] afterwards, to become more independent of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02300a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: ''St. Barnabas'']&lt;/ref&gt; In this connection, the question whether Barnabas was an apostle became important, and was often discussed during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[C. J. Hefele]], ''Das Sendschreiben des Apostels Barnabas,'' Tübingen, 1840; [[Otto Braunsberger]], &quot;Der Apostel Barnabas,&quot; Mainz, 1876.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alleged writings ==
[[Tertullian]] and other Western writers regard Barnabas as the author of the [[Letter to the Hebrews]]. This may have been the Roman tradition—which Tertullian usually follows—and in Rome the epistle may have had its first readers. But the tradition has weighty considerations against it.{{Clarify|reason=what considerations|date=June 2010}}

“[[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] of the ninth century, refers to some in his day who were uncertain whether the Acts was written by Clement of Rome, Barnabas, or Luke. Yet Photius is certain that the work must be ascribed to Luke.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=IcwSvPYSpvkC&amp;pg=PA7 ''Commentary on the Acts''] Edwin Wilbur Rice, 1900, p.7. Adolf Harnack mistakenly wrote that Photius believed Barnabas was the author in the 1908 Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, Volume 1, p. 487&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also traditionally associated with the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], although some modern scholars think it more likely that that epistle was written in Alexandria in the 130s. John Dominic Crossan quotes Koester as stating that New Testament writings are used &quot;neither explicitly nor tacitly&quot; in the Epistle of Barnabas and that this &quot;would argue for an early date, perhaps even before the end of I C.E.&quot; Crossan continues (The Cross that Spoke, p.&amp;nbsp;121):
Richardson and Shukster have also argued for a first-century date. Among several arguments they point to the detail of &quot;a little king, who shall subdue three of the kings under one&quot; and &quot;a little crescent horn, and that it subdued under one three of the great horns&quot; in Barnabas 4:4-5. They propose a composition &quot;date during or immediately after the reign of Nerva (96-8 C.E.) . . . viewed as bringing to an end the glorious Flavian dynasty of Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian . . . when a powerful, distinguished, and successful dynasty was brought low, humiliated by an assassin's knife&quot; (33, 40).
In 16:3-4, the Epistle of Barnabas says: &quot;Furthermore he says again, 'Lo, they who destroyed this temple shall themselves build it.' That is happening now. For owing to the war it was destroyed by the enemy; at present even the servants of the enemy will build it up again.&quot; This clearly places Barnabas after the destruction of the temple in 70 CE. But it also places Barnabas before the Bar Kochba revolt in 132 CE, after which there could have been no hope that the Romans would help to rebuild the temple. This shows that the document comes from the period between these two revolts.
Jay Curry Treat states on the dating of Barnabas (The Anchor Bible Dictionary, v. 1, pp.&amp;nbsp;613–614):
Since Barnabas 16:3 refers to the destruction of the temple, Barnabas must be written after 70 C.E. It must be written before its first indisputable use in Clement of Alexandria, ca. 190. Since 16:4 expects the temple to be rebuilt, it was most likely written before Hadrian built a Roman temple on the site ca. 135. Attempts to use 4:4-5 and 16:1-5 to specify the time of origin more exactly have not won wide agreement. It is important to remember that traditions of varying ages have been incorporated into this work.
Treat comments on the provenance of the Epistle of Barnabas (op. cit., p.&amp;nbsp;613):
Barnabas does not give enough indications to permit confident identification of either the teacher's location or the location to which he writes. His thought, hermeneutical methods, and style have many parallels throughout the known Jewish and Christian worlds. Most scholars have located the work's origin in the area of Alexandria, on the grounds that it has many affinities with Alexandrian Jewish and Christian thought and because its first witnesses are Alexandrian. Recently, Prigent (Prigent and Kraft 1971: 20-24), Wengst (1971: 114-18), and Scorza Barcellona (1975: 62-65) have suggested other origins based on affinities in Palestine, Syria, and Asia Minor. The place of origin must remain an open question, although the Gk-speaking E. Mediterranean appears most probable.
Concerning the relationship between Barnabas and the New Testament, Treat writes (op. cit., p.&amp;nbsp;614):
Although Barnabas 4:14 appears to quote Matt 22:14, it must remain an open question whether the Barnabas circle knew written gospels. Based on Koester's analysis (1957: 125-27, 157), it appears more likely that Barnabas stood in the living oral tradition used by the written gospels. For example, the reference to gall and vinegar in Barnabas 7:3, 5 seems to preserve an early stage of tradition that influenced the formation of the passion narratives in the Gospel of Peter and the synoptic gospels.

The 5th century ''[[Decretum Gelasianum]]'' includes a ''Gospel of Barnabas'' amongst works condemned as [[apocrypha]]l; but no certain text or quotation from this work has been identified.

Another book using that same title, the [[Gospel of Barnabas]], survives in two post-medieval manuscripts in Italian and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[T. Zahn]], ''Geschichte des neutestamentlichen Kanons,'' ii, 292, Leipsig, 1890.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the canonical Christian [[Gospel]]s, and in accordance with the [[Islamic view of Jesus]], this later Gospel of Barnabas states that [[Jesus]] was not the [[son of God]], but a [[Prophets of Islam|prophet]] and messenger. The book also says Jesus rose alive into [[Heaven]] without having been [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified]] and mentions [[Muhammad]] by name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://numerical19.tripod.com/muhammad_in_barnabas.htm Numerical119.tripod.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the exact dating is disputed, there is also a dispute among scholars as to the work being [[pseudepigraphical]] or [[apocryphal]].&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Glass.  The Concise Encyclopedia of Islam, Harper &amp; Row, 1989, p. 64.  Quoted at http://answering-islam.org/Barnabas/&lt;/ref&gt;
