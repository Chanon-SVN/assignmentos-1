Amara Sinha
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Amara Sinha''' (or '''Simha'''&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt;) (c. AD 375) was a [[Sanskrit]] [[grammar]]ian and [[poet]], of whose personal history hardly anything is known.{{cn|date=October 2014}}

He is said to have been &quot;one of the nine gems that adorned the throne of [[Vikramaditya]],&quot; and according to the evidence of [[Hsuan Tsang]], this is the [[Chandragupta Vikramaditya]] ([[Chandragupta II]]) that flourished about AD 375.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
Other sources describe him as flourishing in c. AD 700.&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;&quot;Amara-Simha&quot; in ''[[Chambers's Encyclop√¶dia]]''. London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol. 1, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amara seems to have been a [[Buddhist]], and most of his work was destroyed, with the exception of what is the celebrated ''[[Amara-Kosha]]'' (''Treasury of Amara''), a vocabulary of Sanskrit roots, in three books, and hence sometimes called ''Trikanda'' or the &quot;Tripartite&quot;. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
It is also known as &quot;Namalinganushasana&quot;.

It contains 10,000 words, and is arranged, like other works of its class, in metre, to aid the memory.  The first chapter of the ''Kosha'' was printed at [[Rome]] in Tamil character in 1798.  An edition of the entire work, with English notes and an index by [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke|HT Colebrooke]], appeared at [[Serampore]] in 1808. The Sanskrit text was printed at [[Calcutta]] in 1831.  A French translation by ALA Loiseleur-Deslongchamps as published at Paris in 1839. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
[[Benjamin L. Rice|Louie Rice]] compiled the [[Kannada]] version of it and its available 4th edition was printed in 1927 which contains three khandas and 25 sargas.&lt;ref&gt;Amarakosha by Louie Rice edited by N.Balasubhramanyam&lt;/ref&gt;
