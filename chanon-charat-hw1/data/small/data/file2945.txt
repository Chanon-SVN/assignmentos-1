{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2012}}
In some Christian denominations (especially [[Evangelical]]), to be '''born again''' is to undergo a &quot;spiritual rebirth&quot; ([[Regeneration (theology)|regeneration]]) of the human spirit from the [[Holy Spirit]], contrasted with the physical birth everyone experiences. The origin of the term &quot;born again&quot; is the [[New Testament]]: &quot;[[Jesus]] replied, 'Very truly I tell you, no one can see the [[kingdom of God]] without being born again.{{'&quot;}}{{Bibleref2c|John|3:3|NIV|Jn 3:3 NIV}}.&lt;ref&gt;Or &quot;born from above&quot; according to some other translations&lt;/ref&gt; It is a term associated with [[salvation]] in mainstream [[Christianity]], usually meaning simply ''the [[baptism]]''. Individuals who profess to be born again often state that they have a personal relationship with [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref name=Price&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert M.

==History and usage==
{{Methodism}}
Many historic church denominations understood being &quot;born again&quot; as a [[baptismal regeneration|spiritual regeneration]] via the [[sacrament]] of [[baptism]] by the power of the water and the [[Logos (Christianity)|word]]. This understanding persists in [[Roman Catholicism]], in some parts of [[Anglicanism]],&lt;ref&gt;
See the section on Anglicanism in [[Baptismal regeneration#brganglican|Baptismal regeneration]]
&lt;/ref&gt; 
in [[Lutheranism]] and in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]. However, beginning sometime after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], Evangelical Protestants have predominantly understood being ''born again''&lt;ref name=&quot;GoodWord&quot;&gt;
&quot;born-again.&quot; ''Good Word Guide.'' London: A&amp;C Black, 2007. Credo Reference. 30 July 2009
&lt;/ref&gt;
as an experience of [[Religious conversion|conversion]], symbolized by deep-water baptism, and rooted in a commitment to one's own personal faith in Jesus Christ for salvation. This same belief is also an integral part of [[Methodist]] doctrine,&lt;ref name=&quot;Methodist&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Such &quot; 'Rebirth' has often been identified with a definite, temporally datable form of  'conversion'.&quot; Its effects vary with the type of person involved:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
With the voluntaristic type, rebirth is expressed in a new alignment of the will, in the liberation of new capabilities and powers that were hitherto undeveloped in the person concerned. With the intellectual type, it leads to an activation of the capabilities for understanding, to the breakthrough of a &quot;vision&quot;. With others it leads to the discovery of an unexpected beauty in the order of nature or to the discovery of the mysterious meaning of history. With still others it leads to a new vision of the moral life and its orders, to a selfless realization of love of neighbour. ... each person affected perceives his life in Christ at any given time as “newness of life.”
&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', entry for The Doctrine of Man (from Christianity), 2004.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Melton:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Born again is a phrase used by many Protestants to describe the phenomenon of gaining faith in Jesus Christ. It is an experience when everything they have been taught as Christians becomes real, and they develop a direct and personal relationship with God.&lt;ref&gt;Melton, JG., ''Encyclopedia Of Protestantism (Encyclopedia of World Religions)''
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Purves and Partee,&lt;ref&gt;Purves, A. and Partee, C., ''Encountering God: Christian Faith in Turbulent Times'', Westminster John Knox Press, 2000, p. 96
&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Sometimes the phrase seems to be judgemental, making a distinction between genuine and nominal Christians. Sometimes ... descriptive, like the distinction between liberal and conservative Christians. Occasionally, the phrase seems historic, like the division between Catholic and Protestant Christians.&quot;
Furthermore, the term &quot;usually includes the notion of human choice in salvation and excludes a view of divine election by grace alone&quot;.

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]], finding examples going back to 1961, defines the adjective &quot;born-again&quot; as:

{{quote|Of, pertaining to, or characterized by (an experience of) new birth in Christ or spiritual renewal; of a Christian: placing special emphasis on this experience as a basis for all one's actions, evangelical.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Origin===

====Biblical foundation====
The [[King James Version|King James' Version]] uses the phrase ''born again'' three times. Two appear in chapter 3 of the Gospel of John. Jesus is speaking to [[Nicodemus]], a [[Pharisee]] described as &quot;a ruler of the Jews&quot;, who says that, because of his miracles, Jesus is known &quot;to be a teacher come from God&quot;. Jesus immediately replies: &quot;Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&quot;{{Bibleref2c|Jn|3:3|KJV}} &lt;ref name=&quot;MSM&quot; /&gt;
A few verses later the Gospel quotes Jesus as saying:

{{Quote|Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again. / The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.{{Bibleref2c|Jn|3:7|KJV}}}}

John's Gospel was written in Greek, and the Greek word translated as ''again'' is ''ανωΘεν'' (anothen), which could mean ''again'', or ''from above''. The [[New Revised Standard Version]] prefers this latter translation,&lt;ref name = &quot;MSM&quot; /&gt; and both the King James Version and the [[Revised Version]] give it as an alternative in the margins.  Hoskyns argues that it is to be preferred as the fundamental meaning and he drew attention to phrases such as &quot;birth of the Spirit ({{bibleref2|Jn|1:5|KJV|v.5}})&quot;, &quot;birth from God (cf. {{bibleref2|Jn|1:12-13|KJV}}; {{bibleref2|1Jn|2:29|KJV}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Jn|3:9|KJV}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Jn|4:7|KJV}}, {{bibleref2-nb|1Jn|5:18|KJV}})&quot; but continues to claim that this necessarily carries with it an emphasis upon the newness of the life as given by God himself.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskyns, Sir Edwyn C. and Davy, F.N.(ed), ''The Fourth Gospel'', Faber &amp; Faber 2nd ed. 1947, pp. 211,212&lt;/ref&gt;

The third and last mention of the phrase occurs in the First Letter of Peter. The King James Bible translates this as:

{{Quote|Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, [see that ye] love one another with a pure heart fervently: / Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.{{Bibleref2c|1Peter|1:22-23|KJV|1 Peter 1:22-23}}}}

Here, the Greek word translated as &quot;born again&quot; is {{lang|el|αναγεγεννημενοι}} ({{transl|el|''anagegennemenoy''}}).&lt;ref name = &quot;SJF&quot;&gt;Fisichella, SJ., ''Taking Away the Veil: To See Beyond the Curtain of Illusion'', iUniverse, 2003, pp. 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interpretations====
The traditional Jewish understanding of the promise of salvation is interpreted as being rooted in &quot;the seed of Abraham&quot;; that is in the physical lineage from Abraham. Jesus explained to Nicodemus that this doctrine was in error—that every person must have two births—the natural birth of the physical body, the other of the water and the spirit.&lt;ref&gt;
Emmons, Samuel B. ''A Bible Dictionary.'' BiblioLife, 2008. ISBN 978-0-554-89108-8.
&lt;/ref&gt; This discourse with Nicodemus established the Christian belief that all human beings—whether Jew or Gentile—must be &quot;born again&quot; of the spiritual seed of Christ. The [[Apostle Peter]] further reinforced this understanding in {{Bibleref2|1Peter|1:23|KJV|1 Peter 1:23}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;SJF&quot; /&gt; The ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' states that &quot;[a] controversy existed in the primitive church over the interpretation of the expression ''the [[seed of Abraham]]''. It is &lt;nowiki&gt;[the Apostle Paul's]&lt;/nowiki&gt; teaching in one instance that all who are Christ's by faith are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to promise. He is concerned, however, with the fact that the promise is not being fulfilled to the seed of Abraham (referring to the Jews).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
Driscoll, James F. &quot;Divine Promise (in Scripture).&quot; The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 15 Nov 2009 &lt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12453a.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Hodge]] writes that &quot;The subjective change wrought in the soul by the grace of God, is variously designated in Scripture&quot; with terms such as new birth, resurrection, new life, new creation, renewing of the mind, dying to sin and living to righteousness, and translation from darkness to light.&lt;ref name=Hodge1&gt;Hodge, Charles. &quot;Regeneration.&quot; ''Systematic Theology-Volume III.'' Web: http://www.ccel.org/ccel/hodge/theology3.iii.i.i.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus Christ used the &quot;birth&quot; analogy in tracing spiritual newness of life to a divine beginning. Contemporary Christian theologians have provided explanations for &quot;born from above&quot; being a more accurate translation of the original Greek word transliterated ''anōthen.''&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.biblestudytools.com/lexicons/greek/nas/anothen.html ''The New Testament Greek Lexicon.''] 30 July 2009. Online.
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Theologian Frank Stagg]] cites two reasons why the newer translation is significant:
# The emphasis &quot;from ''above''&quot; (implying &quot;from ''Heaven''&quot;) calls attention to the source of the &quot;newness of life.&quot; Stagg writes that the word &quot;again&quot; does not include the ''source'' of the new kind of beginning
# More than personal improvement is needed. &quot;...a new destiny requires a new origin, and the new origin must be from God.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stagg, Evelyn and Frank. ''Woman in the World of Jesus.'' Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1978. ISBN 0-664-24195-6&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of the term in its more modern use appears in the sermons of [[John Wesley]]. In the sermon printed under the title of ''A New Birth'' he writes &quot;none can be holy unless he be born again&quot;, and &quot;except he be born again, none can be happy even in this world. For ... a man should not be happy who is not holy.&quot; Also, &quot;I say, [a man] may be born again and so become an heir of salvation.&quot; Wesley also states infants who are baptized are born again, but for adults it is different:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
... our church supposes, that all who are baptized in their infancy, are at the same time born again. ... But ... it is sure all of riper years, who are baptized, are not at the same time born again.&lt;ref&gt;Wesley, J., ''The works of  the Reverend John Wesley'', Methodist Episcopal Church, 1831, pp. 405–406.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Denominational positions==
For American Christians, ''The Oxford Handbook of Religion and American Politics'' notes: &quot;The [[General Social Survey|GSS]] ... has asked a born-again question on three occasions ... 'Would you say you have been 'born again' or have had a 'born-again' experience?&quot; The Handbook says that &quot;Evangelical, black, and Latino Protestants tend to respond similarly, with about two-thirds of each group answering in the affirmative. In contrast, only about one third of mainline Protestants and one sixth of Catholics (Anglo and Latino) claim a born-again experience.&quot; However, the handbook suggests that &quot;born-again questions are poor measures even for capturing evangelical respondents. ... it is likely that people who report a born-again experience also claim it as an identity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Handbook of Religion and American Politics'', OUP, p16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catholicism===
{{Over-quotation|section|date=June 2014}}
The [[Catholic Church]] identifies regeneration (being &quot;born again&quot;) with the [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|sacrament]] of [[baptism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;catholic.com&quot;&gt;http://www.catholic.com/tracts/are-catholics-born-again&lt;/ref&gt;
The catholic.com site has:&lt;blockquote&gt;Regeneration (being &quot;born again&quot;) is the transformation from death to life that occurs in our souls when we first come to God and are justified. &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The site catholic education.org &lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/apologetics/ap0022.html&lt;/ref&gt; adds:&lt;blockquote&gt;How, then, should a Catholic answer the question, “Have you been born again?” An accurate answer would be, “Yes, I was born again in baptism.” Yet leaving it at that may generate even more confusion. ... The Catholic, then, should do more than simply point to his baptism; he should discuss his living faith, trust and love of Christ; his desire to grow in sanctity and conformity to Christ; and his total dependence on Christ for salvation. These are integral to the new life of the Holy Spirit that baptism bestows. When the Fundamentalist sees the link between baptism and the Holy Spirit in the life of his Catholic neighbor, he may begin to see that St. Paul was more than figurative when he wrote, “You were buried with Christ in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead” (Col 2:12).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, at the [[Council of Trent]], on 15 November 1551, the necessity for a ''second conversion'' after [[baptism]] was delineated:&lt;ref name=&quot;Trent&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Ross Thomas Hindman|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=COVi91uaZJEC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=born+again+1428++Catechism+Catholic+Church#v=onepage&amp;q=born%20again%201428%20%20Catechism%20Catholic%20Church&amp;f=false|title=The Great Divide|quote=''Session 14'' (November 15, 1551): The necessity of a &quot;second conversion&quot; after baptism is confirmed.

Jesus' call to conversion and penance, like that of the prophets before him, does not aim first at outward works, &quot;sackcloth and ashes,&quot; fasting and mortification, but at the conversion of the heart, interior conversion ([[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] § 1428 &amp; 1430).}}

===Protestantism===

====Lutheranism====
The [[Lutheran Church]] holds that it &quot;thoroughly teaches that we are cleansed of our sins and born again and renewed in Holy Baptism by the Holy Ghost. But she also teaches that whoever is baptized must, though daily contrition and repentance, drown The Old Adam so that daily a new man come forth and arise who walks before God in righteousness and purity forever. She teaches that whoever lives in sins after his baptism has again lost the grace of baptism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Walther2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Walther|first=Carl Ferdinand Wilhelm|title=Sermons and prayers for Reformation and Luther commemorations|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qWqjkSf4zKMC&amp;pg=PA27|accessdate=10 April 2014|year=2008|publisher=Joel Baseley|isbn=9780982252321|page=27|quote=Furthermore, the Lutheran Church also thoroughly teaches that we are cleansed of our sins and born again and renewed in Holy Baptism by the Holy Ghost.

She teaches that whoever lives in sins after his baptism has again lost the grace of baptism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anglicanism====
The phrase is mentioned in the [[39 Articles]] of the [[Anglican Church]] in article XV, which is headed &quot;Of Christ alone without Sin&quot;. In part, it reads: &quot;sin, as S. John saith, was not in Him. But all we the rest, although baptized and born again in Christ, yet offend in many things: and if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eskimo.com/~lhowell/bcp1662/articles/articles.html] Accessed 8 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reformed====
The [[Dutch Reformed Church|Reformed churches]] reject both the Catholic/Lutheran and Methodist/Evangelical concepts of being born again. Here, &quot;regeneration, the equivalent to being 'born again,' is the inward working of the Spirit which induces the sinner to respond to the effectual call&quot;. This is &quot;the work of God’s Spirit, whereby, convincing us of our sin and misery, enlightening our minds in the knowledge of Christ, and renewing our wills, he doth persuade and enable us to embrace Jesus Christ, freely offered to us in the gospel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Shorter Westminster Catechism, Question 31''.&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformed.com/publications/bornagain.php|title=Do You Know the Truth About Being Born Again?|last=Pribble|first=Stephen|publisher=Reformed Presbyterian Church|accessdate=10 April 2014|location=Southfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

God first sovereignly and efficaciously regenerates, and only in consequence of that do we act. Therefore, the individual is passive in regeneration, neither preparing himself nor making himself receptive to what God will do. Regeneration is a change wrought in us by God, not an autonomous act performed by us for ourselves.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Storms2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Storms|first=Samuel|title=Chosen for Life: The Case for Divine Election|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kh6xpUFPG8gC&amp;pg=PA150|accessdate=10 April 2014|date=25 January 2007|publisher=Crossway|isbn=9781433519635|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Methodism]], the &quot;new birth is necessary for salvation because it marks the move toward holiness.

&quot;Although many evangelicals allow that conversion can be a process, generally they see it as a specific, identifiable moment of time when a person simply and sincerely trusts in Jesus Christ as savior.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MSM&quot;&gt;Mullen, MS., in Kurian, GT., ''The Encyclopedia of Christian Civilization'', J. Wiley &amp; Sons, 2012, p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; They understand {{Bibleref2|Romans|10:9}} to indicate a requirement of salvation: &quot;That if you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord', and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.&quot; So, &quot;to be born again&quot; means &quot;to be saved&quot; because to be saved, one must confess Jesus is Lord with one's mouth and believe it in one's heart. Also, to be born again means to follow {{Bibleref2|Romans|10:10}} that &quot;with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you profess your faith and are saved&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, RC. ''I healed you with my word'', Xulan, 2007, p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nontrinitarianism===
====Jehovah’s Witnesses====
[[Jehovah’s Witnesses]] believe that individuals do not have the power to be born again, but that God calls and selects his followers &quot;from above&quot;. They interpret Jesus' statement that one must be born from &quot;water and the spirit&quot; to enter the kingdom of God, as a necessity rather than a command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Watchtower|title=The New Birth&amp;mdash;A Personal Decision?|date=April 1, 2009|pages=5&amp;ndash;6|url=http://wol.jw.org/en/wol/d/r1/lp-e/2009242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disagreements between denominations==
{{Over-quotation|section|date=June 2014}}
The term &quot;born again&quot; is used by several Christian denominations, but there are disagreements on what the term means, and whether members of other denominations are justified in claiming to be born again Christians.

A Catholic website says:&lt;blockquote&gt;Catholics should ask Protestants, &quot;Are you born again—the way the Bible understands that concept?&quot; If the Evangelical has not been properly water baptized, he has not been born again &quot;the Bible way,&quot; regardless of what he may think.&lt;ref name=&quot;catholic.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
On the other hand, an Evangelical site argues:&lt;blockquote&gt;Another of many examples is the Catholic who claims he also is &quot;born again.&quot; ... However, what the committed Catholic means is that he received his spiritual birth when he was baptized—either as an infant or when as an adult he converted to Catholicism. That's not what Jesus meant when He told Nicodemus he &quot;must be born again&quot; (Jn 3:3-8). The deliberate adoption of biblical terms which have different meanings for Catholics has become an effective tool in Rome's ecumenical agenda.&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, TA, ''The &quot;Evangelical&quot; Seduction'', [http://www.reachingcatholics.org/seduction.html], Accessed 10 Feb 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Reformed view of regeneration may be set apart from other outlooks in at least two ways. {{quote|First, classical Roman Catholicism teaches that regeneration occurs at baptism, a view known as baptismal regeneration. Reformed theology has insisted that regeneration may take place at any time in a person's life, even in the womb. It is not somehow the automatic result of baptism. Second, it is common for many other evangelical branches of the church to speak of repentance and faith leading to regeneration (i.e., people are born again only after they exercise saving faith). By contrast, Reformed theology teaches that original sin and total depravity deprive all people of the moral ability and will to exercise saving faith. ... Regeneration is entirely the work of God the Holy Spirit - we can do nothing on our own to obtain it. God alone raises the elect from spiritual death to new life in Christ (Eph. 2:1-10).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thirdmill.org/studybible/note.asp/id/40917|title=Regeneration and New Birth: Must I Be Born Again?|publisher=Third Millennium Ministries|accessdate=10 April 2014|quote=In Reformed theology regeneration, the equivalent to being &quot;born again,&quot; is a technical term referring to God revitalizing a person by implanting new desire, purpose and moral ability that lead to a positive response to the Gospel of Christ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Public stances==
In recent history, ''born again'' is a term that has been widely associated with the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian renewal since the late 1960s, first in the United States and then later around the world. Associated perhaps initially with [[Jesus movement|Jesus People]] and the Christian counterculture, ''born again'' came to refer to a conversion experience, accepting Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior in order to be saved from Hell and given eternal life with God in Heaven, and was increasingly used as a term to identify devout believers.&lt;ref name = &quot;MSM&quot; /&gt; By the mid-1970s, ''born again'' Christians were increasingly referred to in the mainstream media as part of the born again movement.

In 1976, Watergate conspirator [[Chuck Colson]]'s book ''Born Again'' gained international notice. [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] named him &quot;One of the 25 most influential Evangelicals in America.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101050207/photoessay/5.html The 25 Most Influential Evangelicals in America.]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was sufficiently prevalent that during the year's presidential campaign, most notably with [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic party]] nominee [[Jimmy Carter]] describing himself as &quot;born again&quot; in the first ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine interview of an American presidential candidate. Modern musicians such as [[Little Richard]],&lt;ref name=&quot;whitep83&quot;&gt;White, Charles (2003), p. 83 (see text under photo on opposite page).

Others such as department store magnate [[James Cash Penney]], [[Chick-fil-A]] founder [[S. Truett Cathy|Truett Cathy]], actor/martial artist [[Chuck Norris]], wrestlers [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Chris Jericho]], [[AJ Styles]], [[Ted DiBiase]] and [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]], and actors [[Jesse McCartney]], [[Kirk Cameron]], and [[Mr. T]] are also mentioned as being born again. Born-again athletes like former [[New York Jets]] quarterback [[Tim Tebow]], [[St. Louis Rams]] quarterback [[Sam Bradford]] and former Rams [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] winning quarterback [[Kurt Warner]], Olympic hurdler [[Lolo Jones]], boxer [[Katie Taylor]] and [[Houston Rockets]] player [[Jeremy Lin]]. Former [[Alabama]] governor and American presidential candidate [[George Wallace]] became born again in the late 1970s, which led him to apologize for his earlier [[segregationist]] views.

===Chuck Colson===
In his book ''Born Again'' (1976 and 2008), [[Watergate Scandal|Watergate]] conspirator [[Charles Colson|Chuck Colson]] describes his path to faith in conjunction with his criminal imprisonment and played a significant role in solidifying the &quot;born again&quot; identity as a cultural construct in the US. He writes that his spiritual experience followed considerable struggle and hesitancy to have a &quot;personal encounter with God.&quot; He recalls:&lt;blockquote&gt;... while I sat alone staring at the sea I love, words I had not been certain I could understand or say fell from my lips: &quot;Lord Jesus, I believe in You. I accept You. Please come into my life. I commit it to You.&quot;  With these few words...came a sureness of mind that matched the depth of feeling in my heart. There came something more: strength and serenity, a wonderful new assurance about life, a fresh perception of myself in the world around me.&lt;ref&gt;Colson, Charles W. ''Born Again.'' Chosen Books (Baker Publishing), 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Born-again and US politics==
The first President of the United States to publicly declare that he was born-again was [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Hough, JF., ''Changing party coalitions'', Algora Publishing, 2006, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;In the 1980 campaign, all three of the major candidates ... stated that they had been born-again&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Utter, GH. and Tru, JL.,''Conservative Christians and political participation: a reference handbook'', ABC-CLIO, 2004, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; state that &quot;Ronald Reagan's election that fall [was] aided by the votes of 61% of 'born-again' white Protestants.&quot;

[[The Gallup Organization]] reported that &quot;In 2003, 42% of U.S. adults said they were born-again or evangelical; the 2004 percentage is 41%.&quot; Also, &quot;Black Americans are far more likely to identify themselves as born-again or evangelical, with 63% of blacks saying they are born-again, compared with 39% of white Americans. Republicans are far more likely to say they are born-again (52%) than Democrats (36%) or independents (32%).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/14632/who-has-been-born-again.aspx |title=Winseman.

&lt;/ref&gt; refers to them having &quot;a type of intolerance&quot;. She says, &quot;The instant and thoughtless panaceas of born-again Christianity will be seen as a vast sanctuary by millions of North Americans.&quot; She asks, &quot;Is this sanctuary really a recruitment camp for right-wing movements? It would be naive to think otherwise.&quot;

&lt;/ref&gt; referring to several studies, reports &quot;that 'born-again' identification is associated with lower support for government anti-poverty programs.&quot; It also notes that &quot;self-reported born-again&quot; Christianity, &quot;strongly shapes attitudes towards economic policy.&quot;

==Criticism==

===Biblical arguments===
The quotation from the Gospel of John has raised some questions about the meaning and authenticity of the phrase &quot;born again&quot;. In the chapter, [[Nicodemus]] is puzzled and asks Jesus what he means by saying that &quot;Ye must be born again&quot;. He questions: &quot;How can a man re-enter his mother's womb?&quot; Scholar [[Bart D. Ehrman]] says that this confusion is because in Greek (the language of the gospel) the word ''again'' is ambiguous. It might mean ''again'' or ''a second time'' or ''from above'', which would explain Nicodemus' confusion. However, the Jews at Jesus' time were actually speaking Aramaic, in which language there would not have been a double meaning. Ehrman says that this raises questions about the authenticity of the dialogue, the meaning of the words, and, therefore, the use of the phrase.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bart D. Ehrman|Ehrman, B.D.]], Referred to in Edward T. Babinski ''The &quot;Born Again&quot; Dialogue In the Gospel of John (Another Reason To Doubt Its Authenticity)'' from http://etb-biblical-errancy.blogspot.com/2012/04/born-again-dialogue-in-gospel-of-john.html Accessed 25 Feb 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 19th-century source notes that the phrase was not mentioned by the other Evangelists, nor by the Apostles except Peter. &quot;It was not regarded by any of the Evangelists but John of sufficient importance to record.&quot; And, without John, &quot;we should hardly have known that it was necessary for one to be born again.&quot; This suggests that &quot;the text and context was meant to apply to Nicodemus particularly, and not to the world.&quot; Otherwise, it would have been mentioned more often.
