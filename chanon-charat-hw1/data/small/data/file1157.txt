'''African Americans''', also referred to as '''Black Americans''' or '''Afro-Americans''', is an [[ethnic group]] of citizens or residents of the [[United States]] with total or partial ancestry from any of the native populations of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;“Black or African American” refers to a person having origins in any of the Black racial groups of Africa.

[[African-American history]] starts in the 16th century, with Africans forcibly taken as [[Slavery|slaves]] to Spanish America, and in the 17th century with African slaves taken to English [[Colony|colonies]] in North America. After the founding of the United States, [[Slavery in the United States|black people continued to be enslaved]] and [[Racism in the United States|treated as inferiors]]. These circumstances were changed by [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], development of the [[African-American culture|black community]], participation in the great [[Military history of African Americans|military conflicts of the United States]], the elimination of [[racial segregation]], and the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–68)|Civil Rights Movement]]. In 2008, [[Barack Obama]] became the first African American to be elected [[president of the United States]].

===Slavery era===
{{Main|Slavery in the United States|Atlantic slave trade}}
The first African slaves arrived in the present-day United States as part of the [[San Miguel de Gualdape]] colony (most likely located in the [[Winyah Bay]] area of present-day [[South Carolina]]), founded by Spanish explorer [[Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón]] in 1526.&lt;ref name=wright&gt;[[Richard Robert Wright]] (1941) &quot;Negro Companions of the Spanish Explorers&quot;, ''Phylon'' Vol. 2, No. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The ill-fated colony was almost immediately disrupted by a fight over leadership, during which the slaves revolted and fled the colony to seek refuge among local Native Americans. De Ayllón and many of the colonists died shortly afterwards of an epidemic and the colony was abandoned. The settlers and the slaves who had not escaped, returned to [[Haiti]], whence they had come.&lt;ref name=wright/&gt;

In 1565, the colony of [[Saint Augustine, Florida|Saint Augustine]] in Florida, founded by [[Pedro Menendez de Aviles]], became the first permanent European settlement in North America. It included an unknown number of free and enslaved Africans that were part of this colonial expedition.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The first recorded Africans in [[British North America]] (including most of the future United States) were &quot;20 and odd negroes&quot; who came to [[Jamestown, Virginia]] via [[Old Point Comfort|Cape Comfort]] in August 1619 as [[indentured servant]]s. As English settlers died from harsh conditions, more and more Africans were brought to work as laborers. Typically, young men or women would sign a [[Indenture|contract of indenture]] in exchange for transportation to the New World. The landowner received 50 acres of land from the state ([[headright]]s) for each servant purchased (around £6 per person [equivalent to 9 months income in the 17th century]) from a ships captain. An indentured servant (who could be white or black) would work for several years (usually four to seven) without wages. The status of indentured servants in early Virginia and Maryland was similar to slavery. Servants could be bought, sold, or leased and they could be physically beaten for disobedience or running away. Unlike slaves, they were freed after their term of service expired or was bought out, their children did not inherit their status, and on their release from contract they received &quot;a year's provision of corn, double apparel, tools necessary&quot; and a small cash payment called &quot;freedom dues&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tim |last=Hashaw |title=The First Black Americans |url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070121/29african.htm |publisher=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |date=January 21, 2007 |accessdate=February 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popular conception of a race-based slave system did not fully develop until the 18th century. The [[Dutch West India Company]] introduced slavery in 1625 with the importation of eleven black slaves into [[New Amsterdam]] (present-day New York City). All the colony's slaves, however, were freed upon its surrender to the British.&lt;ref name = &quot;branchandroot&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last = Hodges | first = Russel Graham | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = Root and Branch: African Americans in New York and East Jersey, 1613–1863 | place = Chapel Hill, North Carolina | publisher = University of North Carolina Press | year = 1999 | edition = | url = | id = | isbn = | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Massachusetts]] was the first British colony to legally recognize slavery in 1641.

The earliest African-American congregations and churches were organized before 1800 in both northern and southern cities following the [[First Great Awakening|Great Awakening]]. By 1775, Africans made up 20% of the population in the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]], which made them the second largest ethnic group after the English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dalhousielodge.org/Thesis/scotstonc.htm |title=Scots to Colonial North Carolina Before 1775 |publisher=Dalhousielodge.org |date= |accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1770s, Africans, both enslaved and free, helped rebellious English colonists secure American Independence by defeating the British in the [[American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~dee/DIASPORA/REV.HTM |title=African Americans in the American Revolution |publisher=Wsu.edu:8080 |date=June 6, 1999 |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Africans and Englishmen fought side by side and were fully integrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africanamericans.com/MilitaryTimeline.htm |title=AfricanAmericans.com |publisher=AfricanAmericans.com |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1860, there were 3.5 million enslaved African Americans in the United States due to the [[Atlantic slave trade]], and another 500,000 African Americans lived free across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://africanhistory.about.com/library/weekly/aa080601a.htm |last=Boddy-Evans |first=Alistair |title=The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade |work=African History |publisher=about.com |accessdate=June 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, during the [[American Civil War]], [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] signed the [[Emancipation Proclamation]].

===Reconstruction and Jim Crow===
{{Main|Reconstruction Era of the United States|Jim Crow laws}}
[[File:Jesse Owens3.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Jesse Owens]] shook racial stereotypes both with Nazis and
segregationists in the USA at the 1936 Berlin Olympics.]]
African Americans quickly set up congregations for themselves, as well as schools and community/civic associations, to have space away from white control or oversight. While the post-war reconstruction era was initially a time of progress for African Americans, in the late 1890s, Southern states enacted Jim Crow laws to enforce [[racial segregation]] and [[disfranchisement after the American Civil War|disenfranchisement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Creating Jim Crow: In-Depth Essay |last=Davis |first=Ronald L.F., PhD |work=The History of Jim Crow |publisher=[[New York Life Insurance Company]] |accessdate=June 7, 2007 |url=http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/history/creating2.htm| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070601223741/http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/history/creating2.htm| archivedate= June 1, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most African Americans followed the Jim Crow laws, using a mask of compliance to prevent becoming victims of [[ethnic violence|racially motivated violence]]. To maintain self-esteem and dignity, African Americans such as [[Anthony Overton]] and [[Mary McLeod Bethune]] continued to build their own [[Historically black colleges and universities|schools]], [[Black church|churches]], banks, social clubs, and other businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jimcrowhistory.org/history/surviving.htm |title=Surviving Jim Crow |last=Davis |first=Ronald, PhD |work=The History of Jim Crow |publisher=[[New York Life Insurance Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last decade of the 19th century, racially discriminatory laws and racial violence aimed at African Americans began to mushroom in the United States. These discriminatory acts included [[racial segregation]]—upheld by the United States Supreme Court decision in [[Plessy v. Ferguson]] in 1896&lt;ref&gt;''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' {{Ussc|163|537|1896}}&lt;/ref&gt;—which was legally mandated by southern states and nationwide at the local level of government, voter suppression or disenfranchisement in the southern states, denial of economic opportunity or resources nationwide, and private acts of violence and mass racial violence aimed at African Americans unhindered or encouraged by government authorities.

The [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|Civil Rights Movement]] from 1954 to 1968 was directed at abolishing [[racism|racial discrimination]] against African Americans, particularly in the Southern United States. The [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]] and the conditions which brought it into being are credited with putting pressure on President [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].
[[File:March on washington Aug 28 1963.jpg|thumb|[[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]], August 28, 1963, shows civil rights leaders and union leaders.]]

Johnson put his support behind passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] that banned discrimination in public accommodations, employment, and [[Trade union|labor unions]], and the [[Voting Rights Act]] of 1965, which expanded federal authority over states to ensure black political participation through protection of voter registration and elections. By 1966, the emergence of the [[Black Power]] movement, which lasted from 1966 to 1975, expanded upon the aims of the Civil Rights Movement to include economic and political self-sufficiency, and freedom from white authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;abbeville&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abbeville.com/civilrights/washington.asp |title=The March On Washington, 1963 |accessdate=October 22, 2007 |publisher=Abbeville Press| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071012121716/http://abbeville.com/civilrights/washington.asp| archivedate= October 12, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the postwar period, many African Americans continued to be economically disadvantaged relative to other Americans. Average black income stood at 54% of that of white workers in 1947, and 55% in 1962. In 1959, median family income for whites was $5,600, compared with $2,900 for nonwhite families. In 1965, 43% of all black families fell into the poverty bracket, earning under $3,000 a year. The Sixties saw improvements in the social and economic conditions of many black Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;The Unfinished Journey: America Since World War II by William H. Chafe&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1965 to 1969, black family income rose from 54% to 60% of white family income. In 1968, 23% of black families earned under $3,000 a year, compared with 41% in 1960. In 1965, 19% of black Americans had incomes equal to the national median, a proportion that rose to 27% by 1967. In 1960, the median level of education for blacks had been 10.8 years, and by the late Sixties the figure rose to 12.2 years, half a year behind the median for whites.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

{{Main|Post Civil Rights Era African-American history}}

Politically and economically, African Americans have made substantial strides during the post-civil rights era. In 1989, [[Douglas Wilder]] became the first African American elected governor in U.S. history. Currently, [[Deval Patrick]] of Massachusetts, is the only African-American governor in office. [[Clarence Thomas]] became the second African-American Supreme Court Justice. In 1992 [[Carol Moseley-Braun]] of [[Illinois]] became the first African-American woman elected to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. There were 8,936 black officeholders in the United States in 2000, showing a net increase of 7,467 since 1970. In 2001 there were 484 black mayors.

In 2005, the number of Africans immigrating to the United States, in a single year, surpassed the peak number who were involuntarily brought to the United States during the [[Atlantic Slave Trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Roberts |first=Sam |date=21 February 2005 |title=

In 1790, when the first [[United States Census|U.S. Census]] was taken, Africans (including slaves and free people) numbered about 760,000—about 19.3% of the population. In 1860, at the start of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the African-American population had increased to 4.4 million, but the percentage rate dropped to 14% of the overall population of the country. The vast majority were slaves, with only 488,000 counted as &quot;[[Freedman|freemen]]&quot;. By 1900, the black population had doubled and reached 8.8 million.

In 1910, about 90% of African Americans lived in the South. Large numbers began migrating north looking for better job opportunities and living conditions, and to escape [[Jim Crow laws]] and racial violence. The [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], as it was called, spanned the 1890s to the 1970s. From 1916 through the 1960s, more than 6 million [[black people]] moved north. But in the 1970s and 1980s, [[New Great Migration|that trend reversed]], with more African Americans moving south to the [[Sun Belt]] than leaving it.

The following table of the African-American population in the United States over time shows that the African-American population, as a percentage of the total population, declined until 1930 and has been rising since then.

By 1990, the African-American population reached about 30 million and represented 12% of the U.S. population, roughly the same proportion as in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/aap/timelin2.html |title=Time Line of African American History, 1881–1900 |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, 38.9 million Americans identified as &quot;Black or African-American,&quot; representing 12.6% of the population. Controversy has surrounded the &quot;accurate&quot; population count of African Americans for decades. The NAACP believed it was under counted intentionally to minimize the significance of the black population in order to reduce their political power base{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}.

At the time of the [[United States Census 2000|2000 Census]], 54.8% of African Americans lived in the [[Southern United States|South]]. In that year, 17.6% of African Americans lived in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and 18.7% in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], while only 8.9% lived in the [[Western United States|western]] states. The west does have a sizable black population in certain areas, however. California, the nation's most populous state, has the fifth largest African-American population, only behind New York, Texas, Georgia, and Florida. According to the 2000 Census, approximately 2.05% of [[Black Hispanic and Latino Americans|African Americans identified as Hispanic or Latino in origin]],&lt;ref name = &quot;tthqvu&quot;/&gt; many of whom may be of [[Afro-Brazilian|Brazilian]], [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]], [[Dominican American|Dominican]], [[Afro-Cuban|Cuban]], [[Haitian American|Haitian]], or other [[Afro-Latin American|Latin American]] descent. The only self-reported ''ancestral'' groups larger than African Americans are the [[Irish American|Irish]] and [[German American|Germans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/c2kbr-35.pdf |title=c2kbr01-2.qxd |format=PDF |accessdate=January 20, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110102014403/http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/c2kbr-35.pdf| archivedate= January 2, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because many African Americans trace their ancestry to colonial American origins, some simply self-identify as &quot;[[American ethnicity|American]]&quot;.

According to the [[2010 United States Census|2010 US Census]], nearly 3% of people who self-identified as black had recent ancestors who immigrated from another country. Self-reported [[West Indian American|non-Hispanic black immigrants from the Caribbean]], mostly from Jamaica and Haiti, represented 0.9% of US population, at 2.6 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;factfinder2.census.gov&quot;&gt;http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_B04003&amp;prodType=table&lt;/ref&gt; Self-reported black immigrants from Sub-Saharan Africa also represented 0.9%, at about 2.8 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;factfinder2.census.gov&quot;/&gt; Additionally, self-identified [[Black Hispanic and Latino Americans|Black Hispanics]] represented 0.4% of the United States population, at about 1.2 million people, largely found within the Puerto Rican and Dominican communities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-04.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Self-reported black immigrants hailing from other countries in the Americas, such as Brazil and Canada, as well as several European countries, represented less than 0.1% of the population. Mixed-Race Hispanic and non-Hispanic Americans who identified as being part black, represented 0.9% of the population. Of the 12.6% of United States residents who identified as black, around 10.3% were &quot;native black American&quot; or ethnic African Americans, who are direct descendants of West/Central Africans brought to the U.S. as slaves. These individuals make up well over 80% of all blacks in the country. When including [[Multiracial American|people of mixed-race origin]], about 13.5% of the US population self-identified as black or &quot;mixed with black&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_10_1YR_DP05&amp;prodType=table&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the U.S. census bureau, evidence from the 2000 Census indicates that many African and Caribbean immigrant ethnic groups do not identify as &quot;Black, African Am., or Negro&quot;. Instead, they wrote in their own respective ethnic groups in the &quot;Some Other Race&quot; write-in entry. As a result, the census bureau devised a new, separate &quot;African American&quot; ethnic group category in 2010 for ethnic African Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tcpms&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 CENSUS PLANNING MEMORANDA SERIES|url=http://www.census.gov/2010census/pdf/2010_Census_Race_HO_AQE.pdf|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following lobbying led by the [[Arab American Institute]], a national organization representing [[Arab Americans]], the census bureau also announced in 2014 that it may establish an additional new ethnic category for populations from the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]] and the [[Arab world]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cbenmenaec&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Census Bureau explores new Middle East/North Africa ethnic category|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/03/24/census-bureau-explores-new-middle-eastnorth-africa-ethnic-category/|publisher=Pew Research Center|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. cities===
{{Further|List of U.S. cities with large African-American populations|List of U.S. metropolitan areas with large African-American populations}}
Almost 58% of African Americans lived in [[metropolitan area]]s in 2000. With over 2 million black residents, New York City had the largest black urban population in the United States in 2000, overall the city has a 28% black population. Chicago has the second largest black population, with almost 1.6 million African Americans in its metropolitan area, representing about 18 percent of the total metropolitan population.

Among cities of 100,000 or more, [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] had the highest percentage of black residents of any U.S. city in 2010, with 82%. Other large cities with African-American majorities include [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]] (60%), [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]] (63%) [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]] (54%, see [[African Americans in Atlanta]]), [[Memphis, Tennessee]] (61%), and Washington, D.C. (50.7%).

The nation's most affluent county with an African-American majority is [[Prince George's County, Maryland]], with a median income of $62,467. Within that county, among the wealthiest communities are [[Glenn Dale, Maryland]] and [[Fort Washington, Maryland]]. Other affluent predominantly African-American counties include [[DeKalb County, Georgia|Dekalb County]] in Georgia, and [[Charles City County, Virginia|Charles City County]] in Virginia. [[Queens|Queens County, New York]] is the only county with a population of 65,000 or more where African Americans have a higher median household income than White Americans.&lt;ref name=Queens/&gt;

[[Seatack, Virginia|Seatack]] is currently the oldest African American community in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rigell.house.gov/videos/?VideoID=Nkfj0D-Qw78 Rep.

===Education===
{{Main|African American education}}
[[File:Neil deGrasse Tyson - NAC Nov 2005.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Neil deGrasse Tyson]] is an [[astrophysicist]].]]

By 2000, African Americans had advanced greatly. They still lagged overall in education attainment compared to white or Asian Americans, with 14 percent with four-year and 5 percent with advanced degrees, though it was higher than for other minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Issued August 2003: Educational Attainment by race and gender: Census 2000 Brief.&lt;/ref&gt; African Americans attend college at about half the rate of whites, but at a greater rate than Americans of Hispanic origin. More African-American women attend and complete college than men. [[Black school]]s for kindergarten through twelfth grade students were common throughout the U.S., and a pattern towards re-segregation is currently occurring across the country.&lt;ref&gt;Kozol, J. [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20051219/kozol &quot;Overcoming Apartheid&quot;, ''The Nation''. December 19, 2005. p. 26].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Historically black colleges and universities]], which were originally set up when segregated colleges did not admit African Americans, continue to educate students today. As late as 1947, about one third of African Americans over 65 were considered to lack the literacy to read and write their own names. By 1969, [[illiteracy]] as it had been traditionally defined, had been largely eradicated among younger African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Public Information Office, [[U.S. Census Bureau]]. [http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/2000/cb00-151.html High School Completions at All-Time High, Census Bureau Reports]. September 15, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

US Census surveys showed that by 1998, 89 percent of African Americans aged 25 to 29 had completed high school, less than whites or Asians, but more than Hispanics. On many college entrance, standardized tests and grades, African Americans have historically lagged behind whites, but some studies suggest that the [[Achievement gap in the United States|achievement gap]] has been closing. Many policy makers have proposed that this gap can and will be eliminated through policies such as [[affirmative action]], desegregation, and multiculturalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.closingtheachievementgap.org/cs/ctag/print/htdocs/home.htm |title=California|publisher=Closing the Achievement Gap |date=January 22, 2008 |accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average graduation rate of blacks in the United States is 52%. Separating this statistic into component parts shows it varies greatly depending upon the state and the school district examined. 38% of black males graduated in the state of New York but in Maine 97% graduated and exceeded the white male graduation rate by 11 percentage points.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schott report&quot; /&gt; In much of the southeastern United States and some parts of the southwestern United States the graduation rate of white males was in fact below 70% such as in Florida where a 62% of white males graduated high school. Examining specific school districts paints an even more complex picture. In the Detroit school district the graduation rate of black males was 20% but 7% white males. In the New York City school district 28% of black males graduate high school compared to 57% of white males. In Newark County{{Where|date=September 2014}} 76% of black males graduated compared to 67% for white males.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schott report&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alonso|first1=Andres A.|title=Black Male Graduation Rates|url=http://blackboysreport.org/national-summary/black-male-graduation-rates|website=blackboysreport.org|publisher=The Schott Foundation for Public Education|accessdate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Chicago, [[Marva Collins]], an African-American educator, created a low cost private school specifically for the purpose of teaching low-income African-American children whom the public school system had labeled as being &quot;[[learning disabled]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marvacollins.com/comments.html |title=Marva Collins Seminars, Inc |publisher=Marvacollins.com |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One article about Marva Collins' school stated,
&lt;blockquote&gt;Working with students having the worst of backgrounds, those who were working far below grade level, and even those who had been labeled as 'unteachable,' Marva was able to overcome the obstacles. News of third grade students reading at ninth grade level, four-year-olds learning to read in only a few months, outstanding test scores, disappearance of behavioral problems, second-graders studying Shakespeare, and other incredible reports, astounded the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edocere.org/articles/marva_collins.htm |title=Excerpts from Ordinary Children, Extraordinary Teachers and Marva Collins' Way |publisher=Edocere.org |date= |accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; During the 2006–2007 school year, Collins' school charged $5,500 for tuition, and parents said that the school did a much better job than the Chicago public school system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?id=6188122&amp;section=news/local |title=Marva Collins School to close |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=June 5, 2008 |accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, during the 2007–2008 year, Chicago public school officials claimed that their budget of $11,300 per student was not enough.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26515276/ Chicago students skip school in funding protest], Associated Press, September 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economically, African Americans have benefited from the advances made during the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|Civil Rights era]], particularly among the educated, but not without the lingering effects of historical marginalization when considered as a whole. The [[Racial inequality in the United States|racial disparity in poverty rates]] has narrowed. The black middle class has grown substantially.

The US [[public sector]] is the single most important source of employment for African Americans.&lt;ref name=&quot;laborcenter.berkeley.edu&quot;&gt;[http://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/blackworkers/blacks_public_sector11.pdf &quot;Black Workers and the Public Sector&quot;, Dr Steven Pitts, University of California, Berkeley, Center for Labor Research and Education, April 4, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; During 2008–2010, 21.2% of all Black workers were public employees, compared with 16.3% of non-Black workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;laborcenter.berkeley.edu&quot;/&gt; Both before and after the onset of the [[Great Recession]], African Americans were 30% more likely than other workers to be employed in the public sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;laborcenter.berkeley.edu&quot;/&gt;

The public sector is also a critical source of decent-paying jobs for Black Americans. For both men and women, the median wage earned by Black employees is significantly higher in the public sector than in other industries.&lt;ref name=&quot;laborcenter.berkeley.edu&quot;/&gt;

In 1999, the median income of African-American families was $33,255 compared to $53,356 of European Americans. In times of economic hardship for the nation, African Americans suffer disproportionately from job loss and [[underemployment]], with the black underclass being hardest hit. The phrase &quot;last hired and first fired&quot; is reflected in the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] unemployment figures. Nationwide, the October 2008 unemployment rate for African Americans was 11.1%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t02.htm |title=BLS.gov |publisher=BLS.gov |date=January 7, 2011 |accessdate=January 20, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101213004820/http://bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t02.htm| archivedate= December 13, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the nationwide rate was 6.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.bls.gov/PDQ/servlet/SurveyOutputServlet?data_tool=latest_numbers&amp;series_id=LNS14000000 |title=BLS.gov |publisher=Data.bls.gov |accessdate=January 20, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110120154929/http://data.bls.gov/PDQ/servlet/SurveyOutputServlet?data_tool=latest_numbers&amp;series_id=LNS14000000| archivedate= January 20, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
{{Main|African American Vernacular English}}
[[African American Vernacular English]] (AAVE) is a [[Variety (linguistics)|variety]] ([[dialect]], [[ethnolect]], and [[sociolect]]) of [[American English]], commonly spoken by urban [[working class|working-class]] and largely [[wiktionary:bidialectal|bi-dialectal]] [[middle class|middle-class]] African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Walter|chapter=African American Vernacular English: phonology|editor-last=Kortmann|editor-first=Bernd|work=A Handbook of Varieties of English|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=2004|volume=2|page=383|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Dptsvykgk3IC|title=A Handbook of Varieties of English: CD-ROM|isbn=9783110175325}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-linguists sometimes call it ''[[Ebonics (word)|Ebonics]]'' (a term that also has other meanings and connotations).

African American Vernacular English evolved during the antebellum period through interaction between speakers of 16th and 17th century English of Great Britain and Ireland and various West African languages. As a result, the variety shares parts of its [[grammar]] and [[phonology]] with the [[Southern American English]] dialect. Where African American Vernacular English differs from Standard American English (SAE) is in certain pronunciation characteristics, tense usage and grammatical structures that were derived from West African languages, particularly those belonging to the [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aave&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Cross-Cultural School Psychology|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=0387717986|page=405|url=http://www.google.com/books?id=PaO3jsaGkeYC|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Virtually all habitual speakers of African American Vernacular English can understand and communicate in Standard American English. As with all linguistic forms, AAVE's usage is influenced by various factors, including geographical, educational and socioeconomic background, as well as formality of setting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aave&quot;/&gt; Additionally, there are many literary uses of this variety of English, particularly in [[African-American literature]].

==Genetics==

===Y-DNA===
According to a [[Y chromosome|Y-DNA]] study by Sims et al. (2007), the majority (~60%) of African Americans belong to various subclades of the [[Haplogroup E-V38|E3a]] (E1b1a) paternal haplogroup. This is the most common genetic paternal lineage found today among West/Central African males, and is also a signature of the historical [[Bantu migration]]s. The next most frequent Y-DNA haplogroup observed amongst African Americans is the [[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)|R1b]] clade, which around 15% of African Americans carry. This lineage is most common today among Northwestern European males. The remaining African Americans mainly belong to the paternal [[Haplogroup I-M170|haplogroup I]] (~7%), which is also frequent in Northwestern Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sims2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lynn M. Sims, Dennis Garvey and Jack Ballantyne|title=Sub-populations within the major European and African derived haplogroups R1b3 and E3a are differentiated by previously phylogenetically undefined Y-SNPs|journal=Human Mutation|date=January 2007|volume=28|issue=1|page=97|doi=10.1002/humu.9469|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/humu.9469/pdf|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===mtDNA===
According to an [[Mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]] study by Salas et al. (2005), the maternal lineages of African Americans are most similar to haplogroups that are today especially common in West Africa (&gt;55%), followed closely by West-Central Africa and Southwestern Africa (&lt;41%). The characteristic West African haplogroups [[Haplogroup L1 (mtDNA)|L1b]], [[Haplogroup L2 (mtDNA)|L2b,c,d]], and [[Haplogroup L3 (mtDNA)|L3b,d]] and West-Central African haplogroups [[Haplogroup L1 (mtDNA)|L1c]] and [[Haplogroup L3 (mtDNA)|L3e]] in particular occur at high frequencies among African Americans. As with the paternal DNA of African Americans, contributions from other parts of the continent to their maternal gene pool are insignificant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salas2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Antonio Salas, Ángel Carracedo, Martin Richards, and Vincent Macaulay|title=Charting the Ancestry of African Americans|journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|date=October 2005|volume=77|issue=4|pages=676–680|doi=10.1086/491675|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1275617/|accessdate=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autosomal DNA===
According to an [[autosomal DNA]] study by Bryc et al. (2009), the overall ancestry of African Americans was formed through historic admixture between West/Central Africans (mainly females) and Europeans (mainly males). Consequently, African Americans have a genome-wide average of 78.1% West African ancestry and 18.5% European ancestry, with very large variation among individuals. The West African ancestral component in African Americans is also primarily affiliated with speakers from the non-[[Bantu languages|Bantu]] branches of the [[Niger-Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] (Niger-Kordofanian) family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bryc2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Katarzyna Bryc, Adam Auton, Matthew R.

==Traditional names==
{{Main|African-American names}}
[[African-American names]] are part of the cultural traditions of African Americans. Prior to the 1950s and 1960s, most African American names closely resembled those used within European American culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baby Name Wizard&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Wattenberg|first=Laura|title=The Baby Name Wizard, Revised 3rd Edition: A Magical Method for Finding the Perfect Name for Your Baby|date=May 7, 2013|publisher=Harmony|isbn=0770436471|url=http://www.amazon.com/Baby-Name-Wizard-Revised-Edition/dp/0770436471/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1392242718&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=baby+name+wizard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babies of that era were generally given a few very common names, with children using [[nickname]]s to distinguish the various people with the same name. With the rise of 1960s [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] movement, there was a dramatic increase in names of various origins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moskowitz&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Moskowitz|first=Clara|title=Baby Names Reveal More About Parents Than Ever Before|url=http://www.livescience.com/9027-baby-names-reveal-parents.html|newspaper=Live Science|date=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s and 1980s, it had become common among African Americans to invent new names, although many of the invented names took elements from popular existing names. Prefixes such as La/Le, Da/De, Ra/Re, or Ja/Je and suffixes like -ique/iqua, -isha, and -aun/-awn are common, as are inventive spellings for common names. The book ''Baby Names Now: From Classic to Cool--The Very Last Word on First Names'' places the origins of &quot;La&quot; names in African American culture in [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenkrantz&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenkrantz|first=Linda|title=Baby Names Now: From Classic to Cool--The Very Last Word on First Names|date=August 16, 2001|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|isbn=0312267576|url=http://www.amazon.com/Baby-Names-Now-Classic-Cool--The/dp/B0009X1MMS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1393738023&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Baby+Names+Now%3A+From+Classic+to+Cool--The+Very+Last+Word+on+First+Names|author2=Satran, Paula Redmond}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with the rise of inventive names, it is still common for African Americans to use biblical, historic, or European names. Daniel, Christopher, Michael, David, James, Joseph, and Matthew were thus among the most frequent names for African American boys in 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baby Name Wizard&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lack|first=Evonne|title=Popular African American Names|url=http://www.babycenter.com/0_popular-african-american-names_10329236.bc|accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Conley&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conley|first=Dalton|title=Raising E and Yo...|journal=Psychology Today|date=March 10, 2010|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/201003/raising-e-and-yo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name LaKeisha is typically considered American in origin, but has elements of it pulled from both French and West/Central African roots. Other names like LaTanisha, JaMarcus, DeAndre, and Shaniqua were created in the same way. Punctuation marks are seen more often within African-American names than other American names, such as the names Mo'nique and D'Andre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baby Name Wizard&quot;/&gt;

==Contemporary issues==
African Americans have improved their social and economic standing significantly since the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–68)|Civil Rights Movement]] and recent decades have witnessed the expansion of a robust, African American middle class across the United States. Unprecedented access to higher education and employment in addition to representation in the highest levels of American government has been gained by African Americans in the post-civil rights era.

Nevertheless, due in part to the legacy of [[slavery]], racism and discrimination, African Americans as a group remain at a pronounced economic, educational and social disadvantage in many areas relative to European Americans. Persistent social, economic and political issues for many African Americans include inadequate health care access and delivery; [[institutional racism]] and discrimination in housing, education, policing, [[criminal justice]] and employment; crime, poverty and [[substance abuse]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

One of the most serious and long standing issues within African-American communities is poverty. Poverty itself is a hardship as it is related to marital stress and dissolution, health problems, low educational attainment, deficits in psychological functioning, and crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;CharacOfFam&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ssw.unc.edu/RTI/presentation/PDFs/aa_families.pdf |title=Characteristics of African American Families |author=Oscar Barbarin, PhD |publisher=University of North Carolina |accessdate=September 23, 2006 |format=PDF| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060920225226/http://ssw.unc.edu/RTI/presentation/PDFs/aa_families.pdf| archivedate= September 20, 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, 24.7% of African-American families lived below the poverty level.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeNavas-Walt&quot;/&gt; In 2007, the average African-American income was $33,916, compared with $54,920 for whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omhrc.gov/templates/browse.aspx?lvl=2&amp;lvlID=51 |title=OMHRC.gov |publisher=OMHRC.gov |date=October 21, 2009 |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics and social issues===

Collectively, African Americans are more involved in the American political process than other minority groups in the United States, indicated by the highest level of voter registration and participation in elections among these groups in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;vote-nov2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2006pubs/p20-556.pdf |title=Voting and Registration in the Election of November 2007 |date=March 2006 |accessdate=May 30, 2007 |format=PDF| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070605102852/http://www.census.gov/prod/2006pubs/p20-556.pdf| archivedate= June 5, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; African Americans collectively attain higher levels of education than immigrants to the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;vote-nov2007&quot;/&gt; African Americans also have the highest level of [[United States Congress|Congressional representation]] of any minority group in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jonathan D.

The large majority of African Americans support the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. In the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 Presidential Election]], Democrat [[John Kerry]] received 88% of the African-American vote compared to 11% for [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.0.html |title=2004 Election Results |publisher=CNN |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is an [[African-American lobby in foreign policy]], it has not had the impact that African-American organizations have had in domestic policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=American Society and the African American Foreign Policy Lobby: Constraints and Opportunities |first=David A. |last=Dickson |journal=Journal of Black Studies |year=1996 |pages=139–151 |volume=27|doi=10.1177/002193479602700201 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the [[New Deal]], African Americans were supporters of the Republican Party because it was Republican President Abraham Lincoln who helped in granting freedom to American slaves; at the time, the Republicans and Democrats represented the [[sectionalism|sectional]] interests of the [[Northern United States|North]] and [[Southern United States|South]], respectively, rather than any specific ideology, and both [[right-wing politics|right]] and [[left-wing politics|left]] were represented equally in both parties.

The African-American trend of voting for Democrats can be traced back to the 1930s during the [[Great Depression]], when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] program provided economic relief to African Americans; Roosevelt's [[New Deal coalition]] turned the Democratic Party into an organization of the working class and their liberal allies, regardless of region. The African-American vote became even more solidly Democratic when Democratic presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] pushed for civil rights legislation during the 1960s.

After over 50 years, marriage rates for ''all'' Americans began to decline while divorce rates and out-of-wedlock births have climbed.&lt;ref name=&quot;media.hoover.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.hoover.org/documents/0817998721_95.pdf |title=psi:output_files:HPTHER$$$6.PS |format=PDF |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These changes have been greatest among African Americans. After more than 70 years of racial parity black marriage rates began to fall behind whites.&lt;ref name=&quot;media.hoover.org&quot;/&gt; Single-parent households have become common, and according to US census figures released in January 2010, only 38 percent of black children live with both their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/families_households/cb10-08.html |title=Census Bureau Reports Families With Children Increasingly Face Unemployment, US Census Bureau, January 15, 2010 |publisher=Census.gov |date= |accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Democrats overwhelmingly voted 70% against [[California Proposition 8]], African Americans voted 58% in favor of it while 42% voted against Proposition 8.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thetaskforce.org/downloads/issues/egan_sherrill_prop8_1_6_09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; On May 9, 2012, Barack Obama, the first African-American president, became the first US president to support same sex marriage. After Obama's endorsement there is a rapid growth in support for same sex marriage among African Americans. Now 59% of African Americans support same sex marriage, which is higher than support among the national average (53%) and [[white Americans]] (50%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Scott Clement and Sandhya Somashekhar |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/after-president-obamas-announcement-opposition-to-gay-marriage-hits-record-low/2012/05/22/gIQAlAYRjU_story.html?hpid=z3 |title=After President Obama's announcement, opposition to gay marriage hits record low |newspaper=The Washington Post |date= May 23, 2012|accessdate=September 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson]] founded [[Black Entertainment Television]], a network that targets young African Americans and urban audiences in the United States. Most programming on the network consists of [[Hip hop music|rap]] and [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] music videos and urban-oriented movies and series. The channel also shows syndicated television series, original programs, and some public affairs programs. On Sunday mornings, BET broadcasts a lineup of network-produced Christian programming; other, non-affiliated Christian programs are also shown during the early morning hours daily. BET is now a global network that reaches 90 million households in the United States, Caribbean, Canada, and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BET Networks|publisher=Viacom|url=http://www.viacom.com/ourbrands/medianetworks/betnetworks/pages/default.aspx|accessdate=September 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to BET there is [[Centric]], which is a spin-off cable television channel of BET, created originally as ''BET on Jazz'' to showcase [[jazz]] music-related programming, especially that of black jazz musicians. Programming has been expanded to include a block of urban programs as well as some R&amp;B, [[soul music|soul]], and [[world music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bet.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070829101056/http://bet.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=18 |archivedate=29 August 2007 |title=BET J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[TV One (Radio One)|TV One]] is another African-American-oriented network and a direct competitor to BET, targeting African American adults with a broad range of programming. The network airs original lifestyle and entertainment-oriented shows, movies, fashion and music programming, as well as classic series such as [[227 (TV series)|227]], [[Good Times]], [[Martin (TV series)|Martin]], [[Boston Public]] and [[Showtime at the Apollo|It's Showtime at the Apollo]]. The network primarily owned by [[Radio One (company)|Radio One]]. Founded and controlled by [[Cathy Hughes|Catherine Hughes]], it is one of the nation's largest radio broadcasting companies and the largest African-American-owned radio broadcasting company in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackamericastudy.com/ |title=BlackAmericaStudy.com |publisher=BlackAmericaStudy.com |accessdate=January 20, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110207200823/http://blackamericastudy.com/| archivedate= February 7, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other African-American networks scheduled to launch in 2009 are the Black Television News Channel founded by former Congressman [[J. C.

===Cultural influence in the United States===
{{Further|African-American culture}}
[[File:Soul Food at Powell's Place.jpg|thumb|A traditional [[soul food]] dinner consisting of [[fried chicken]] with [[macaroni and cheese]], [[collard greens]], breaded fried [[okra]] and [[cornbread]].]]
From their earliest presence in North America, African Americans have contributed literature, art, agricultural skills, foods, clothing styles, music, language, social and technological innovation to American culture. The cultivation and use of many agricultural products in the United States, such as [[Sweet potato|yams]], peanuts, rice, [[okra]], [[sorghum]], [[grits]], [[watermelon]], [[indigo dye]]s, and cotton, can be traced to African and African-American influences. Notable examples include [[George Washington Carver]], who created 300 products from peanuts, 118 products from sweet potatoes, and 75 from pecans; and [[George Crum]], who invented the potato chip in 1853.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enchantedlearning.com/inventors/black.shtml |title=African-American Inventors |accessdate=May 30, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070613230925/http://www.enchantedlearning.com/inventors/black.shtml| archivedate= June 13, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Soul food]] is a variety of [[cuisine]] popular among African-Americans. It is closely related to the [[cuisine of the Southern United States]]. The descriptive terminology may have originated in the mid-1960s, when ''[[wikt:soul|soul]]'' was a common definer used to describe African-American culture (for example, [[soul music]]).

====In music====
[[File:Jazzing orchestra 1921.png|thumb|The King &amp; Carter [[Jazz]]ing Orchestra photographed in Houston, Texas, January 1921]]

[[African-American music]] is one of the most pervasive African-American cultural influences in the United States today and is among the most dominant in mainstream popular music. [[Hip hop music|Hip hop]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]], [[funk]], [[rock and roll]], [[soul music|soul]], [[blues]], and other contemporary American musical forms originated in black communities and evolved from other black forms of music, including [[blues]], [[doo-wop]], [[Barbershop music|barbershop]], [[ragtime]], [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[jazz]], and [[gospel music]].

African-American-derived musical forms have also influenced and been incorporated into virtually every other popular musical genre in the world, including [[Country music|country]] and [[techno]]. African-American genres are the most important ethnic vernacular tradition in America, as they have developed independent of African traditions from which they arise more so than any other immigrant groups, including Europeans; make up the broadest and longest lasting range of styles in America; and have, historically, been more influential, interculturally, geographically, and economically, than other American vernacular traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;stewart&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=Earl L. |year=1998 |title=African American Music: An Introduction |isbn=0-02-860294-3 |page=3 |publisher=Schirmer Books |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African Americans have also had an important role in American dance. [[Bill T. Jones]], a prominent modern choreographer and dancer, has included historical African-American themes in his work, particularly in the piece &quot;Last Supper at Uncle Tom's Cabin/The Promised Land&quot;. Likewise, [[Alvin Ailey]]'s artistic work, including his &quot;Revelations&quot; based on his experience growing up as an African American in the South during the 1930s, has had a significant influence on modern dance. Another form of dance, [[Stepping (African-American)|Stepping]], is an African-American tradition whose performance and competition has been formalized through the traditionally black fraternities and sororities at universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

====In literature and academia====
[[File:Chuck-berry-2007-07-18.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Chuck Berry]] in [[Örebro]], Berry is considered a pioneer of American [[Rock and roll]].]]
Many African-American authors have written stories, poems, and essays influenced by their experiences as African Americans. [[African-American literature]] is a major genre in American literature. Famous examples include [[Langston Hughes]], [[James Baldwin (writer)|James Baldwin]], [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]], [[Zora Neale Hurston]], [[Ralph Ellison]], Nobel Prize winner [[Toni Morrison]], and [[Maya Angelou]].

African-American inventors have created many widely used devices in the world and have contributed to international [[innovation]]. [[Norbert Rillieux]] created the technique for converting sugar cane juice into white sugar crystals. Moreover, Rillieux left [[Louisiana]] in 1854 and went to France, where he spent ten years working with the Champollions deciphering [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Egyptian hieroglyphics]] from the [[Rosetta Stone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inventions.org/culture/african/rillieux.html |title=Norbert Rillieux |publisher=Inventors Assistance League |accessdate=January 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most slave inventors were nameless, such as the slave owned by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] President Jefferson Davis who designed the ship propeller used by the Confederate navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sluby |first=Patricia Carter |title=The Inventive Spirit of African Americans: Patented Ingenuity |year=2004 |publisher=Praeger |location=Westport, Conn. |isbn=0-275-96674-7 |pages=30–33 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Wz-DTSXeLRYC&amp;pg=PA30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1913 over 1,000 inventions were patented by black Americans.

===Political legacy===
[[File:Martin-Luther-King-1964-leaning-on-a-lectern.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]] remains the most prominent political leader in the American Civil Rights Movement and perhaps the most influential African-American political figure in general.]]
African Americans have [[Military history of African Americans|fought]] in every war in the [[Military history of the United States|history of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=48936 |title=Defenselink.mil |publisher=Defenselink.mil |accessdate=January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gains made by African Americans in the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|1950s and 1960s Civil Rights Movement]] and in the Black Power movement not only obtained certain rights for African Americans, but changed American society in far-reaching and fundamentally important ways. Prior to the 1950s, Black Americans in the South were subject to de jure discrimination, or [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]]. They would often be the victims of extreme cruelty and violence, sometimes resulting in deaths: by the post WWII era, African Americans became increasingly discontented with their long-standing inequality. In the words of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], African Americans and their supporters challenged the nation to &quot;rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed that all men are created equal ...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/38.htm |title=Martin Luther King, Jr |accessdate=May 30, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070613010952/http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/democrac/38.htm| archivedate= June 13, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Civil Rights Movement marked a sea-change in American social, political, economic and civic life. It brought with it [[boycott]]s, [[sit-in]]s, [[nonviolent]] demonstrations and marches, court battles, bombings and other violence; prompted worldwide media coverage and intense public debate; forged enduring civic, economic and religious alliances; and disrupted and realigned the nation's two major political parties.

Over time, it has changed in fundamental ways the manner in which blacks and whites interact with and relate to one another. The movement resulted in the removal of codified, ''de jure'' racial segregation and discrimination from American life and law, and heavily influenced other groups and movements in struggles for civil rights and social equality within American society, including the [[Free Speech Movement]], the disabled, the women's movement, Native Americans, and [[migrant workers]].

==Terminology==

===Political overtones===
[[File:1911 Golden Potlatch - Afro-Americans.jpg|thumb|left|This parade float shows a use of the word &quot;Afro-American&quot; in 1911.]]
The term ''African American'' carries important political overtones. Earlier terms used to describe Americans of African ancestry referred more to skin color than ancestry, and were conferred upon the group by colonists and Americans of European ancestry; people with dark skins were considered inferior in fact and in law. The terms (such as ''[[colored]]'', ''[[person of color]]'', or ''[[negro]]'') were included in the wording of various laws and legal decisions which some thought were being used as tools of white supremacy and [[oppression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=xoZ0POyF2YkC&amp;pg=PA86 |title=Out of the Mouths of Slaves: African American Language and Educational Malpractice|author=Baugh, John|page=86|publisher=[[University of Texas Press]]|isbn=978-0-292-70873-0|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; There developed among blacks in America a growing desire for a term of self-identification of their own choosing.

[[File:Michelle Obama official portrait crop.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Michelle Obama]] is the [[First Lady]] of the United States; she and her husband, President Barack Obama, are the first African Americans to hold these positions.]]
With the political consciousness that emerged from the political and social ferment of the late 1960s and early 1970s, blacks no longer approved of the term Negro. They believed it had suggestions of a moderate, accommodationist, even &quot;[[Uncle Tom]]&quot; connotation. In this period, a growing number of blacks in the United States, particularly African-American youth, celebrated their blackness and their historical and cultural ties with the African continent. The Black Power movement defiantly embraced ''Black'' as a group identifier. It was a term social leaders themselves had repudiated only two decades earlier, but they proclaimed, &quot;[[Black is beautiful]]&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In this same period, a smaller number of people favored ''Afro-American'', a common shortening (as is 'Anglo-American'). However, after the decline in popularity of the 'Afro' hairstyle in the late 1970s, the term fell out of use.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In the 1980s the term ''African American'' was advanced on the model of, for example, [[German-American]] or Irish-American to give descendants of American slaves and other American blacks who lived through the [[Slavery in the United States|slavery era]] a [[Cultural heritage|heritage]] and a cultural base.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt; The term was popularized in black communities around the country via word of mouth and ultimately received mainstream use after [[Jesse Jackson]] publicly used the term in front of a national audience. Subsequently, major media outlets adopted its use.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;

Some such as [[Maulana Karenga]] and [[Owen Alik Shahadah]] argue African-American is more appropriate, because it accurately articulates geography and historical origin. Thus linking a people to a continent as opposed to an abstract color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/language%20new%20reality.htm |title=Language for a New African Reality |publisher=Africanholocaust.net |date=April 30, 2010 |accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others believe the term black is inaccurate because African Americans have a variety of skin tones.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Surveys show that the majority of Black Americans have no preference for &quot;African American&quot; versus &quot;Black,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/28816/black-african-american.aspx|title=Black or African American?|first=Frank|last=Newport|publisher=Gallup|date=September 28, 2007|accessdate=September 26, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100906124630/http://www.gallup.com/poll/28816/Black-African-American.aspx| archivedate= September 6, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they have a slight preference for &quot;Black&quot; in personal settings and &quot;African American&quot; in more formal settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Miller| first1 = Pepper| last2 = Kemp|first2=Herb | title = What's Black About?

Many African Americans expressed a preference for the term, as it was formed in the same way as names for others of the many ethnic groups in the nation. Some argued further that, because of the historical circumstances surrounding the capture, enslavement and systematic attempts to de-Africanize blacks in the United States under [[Slavery|chattel slavery]], most African Americans are unable to trace their ancestry to a specific African nation; hence, the entire continent serves as a geographic marker.

For many, &quot;African American&quot; is more than a name expressive of [[culture|cultural]] and historical roots{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}. The term expresses pride in Africa and a sense of kinship and solidarity with others of the [[African diaspora]]{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}—an embrace of pan-Africanism as earlier enunciated by prominent African thinkers such as [[Marcus Garvey]], [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] and [[George Padmore]]. Rarely used terms include Afro-Usonian&lt;ref&gt;Secular devotion: Afro-Latin music and imperial jazz – Page 249, Timothy Brennan – 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and African-Usanian,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/blogs/johnson/2010/12/what_call_americans Yankees, gringos and USAnians] retrieved 26 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1977, in an attempt to keep up with changing social opinion, the United States government has officially classified black people (revised to ''black'' or ''African American'' in 1997) as &quot;having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;censusblack&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/c2kbr01-5.pdf |first=Jesse |last=McKinnon |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=October 22, 2007 |format=PDF |title=The Black Population: 2000 United States Census Bureau| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071025063946/http://www.census.gov/prod/2001pubs/c2kbr01-5.pdf| archivedate= October 25, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other federal offices, such as the [[United States Census]] Bureau, adhere to the [[Office of Management and Budget]] standards on race in its data collection and tabulations efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;OMB&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg/1997standards.html |title=Revisions to the Standards for the Classification of Federal Data on Race and Ethnicity |year=1997 |publisher=Office of Management and Budget}}&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation for the United States 2010 Census, a marketing and outreach plan, called ''2010 Census Integrated Communications Campaign Plan'' (ICC) recognized and defined African Americans as black people born in the United States. From the ICC perspective, African Americans are one of three groups of black people in the United States&lt;ref name = &quot;US2010ICCBlkAud&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= 2010 Census Integrated Communications Campaign Plan |url= http://2010.census.gov/partners/pdf/2010_ICC_Plan_Final_Edited.pdf|work= 2010 Census|publisher= U.S. Census Bureau|page= 225|format=PDF |date= August 2008|accessdate=September 6, 2012|quote = The Black audience includes all individuals of Black African descent.

The ICC plan was to reach the three groups by acknowledging that each group has its own sense of community that is based on geography and ethnicity.&lt;ref name=&quot;US2010ICCBstRch&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title= 2010 Census Integrated Communications Campaign Plan|url=http://2010.census.gov/partners/pdf/2010_ICC_Plan_Final_Edited.pdf|work= 2010 Census|publisher= U.S. Census Bureau|page=230|format=PDF |date= August 2008|accessdate=September 6, 2012|quote = Community, both geographic and ethnic, creates a sense of belonging and pride that is unique to the Black audience (African Americans, Afro-Caribbeans, and Black Africans).}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best way to market the census process toward any of the three groups is to reach them through their own unique communication channels and not treat the entire black population of the U.S. as though they are all African Americans with a single ethnic and geographical background. The U.S. Department of Justice Federal Bureau of Investigation categorizes black or African-American people as &quot;A person having origins in any of the black racial groups of Africa&quot; through racial categories used in the UCR Program adopted from the Statistical Policy Handbook (1978) and published by the Office of Federal Statistical Policy and Standards, U.S. Department of Commerce, derived from the 1977 Office of Management and Budget classification.&lt;ref name=&quot;FBIpop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/additional-ucr-publications/ucr_handbook.pdf/view |title=Uniform Crime Reporting Handbook |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The taboo among American whites surrounding white-black relations can be seen as a historical consequence of the oppression and [[racial segregation]] of African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yancey|first=George|date=March 22, 2007|title=Experiencing Racism: Differences in the Experiences of Whites Married to Blacks and Non-Black Racial Minorities|journal=Journal of Comparative Family Studies|publisher=University of Calgary: Social Sciences|volume=38|issue=2|pages=197–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian David Brion Davis notes the racial mixing that occurred during slavery was frequently attributed by the [[Plantations in the American South|planter class]]  to the &quot;lower-class white males&quot; but Davis concludes that &quot;there is abundant evidence that many slaveowners, sons of slaveowners, and overseers took black mistresses or in effect raped the wives and daughters of slave families.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Brion Davis|Davis, David Brion]].

In her opinion, President Barack Obama, who is the son of a Kenyan immigrant, although technically African-American, is not black.&lt;ref name=&quot;colorblind-salon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;colbertnation.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/81955/february-08-2007/debra-dickerson?videoId=81955 |title=The Colbert Report |author=Debra Dickerson |date=February 8, 2007 |publisher=colbertnation.com |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She makes the argument that grouping all people of African descent together regardless of their unique ancestral circumstances would inevitably deny the lingering effects of slavery within the American community of slave descendants, in addition to denying black immigrants recognition of their own unique ancestral backgrounds. &quot;Lumping us all together&quot;, Dickerson wrote, &quot;erases the significance of slavery and continuing racism while giving the appearance of progress&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;colorblind-salon&quot;/&gt;

Similar viewpoints have been expressed by [[Stanley Crouch]] in a ''New York Daily News'' piece, [[Charles Steele, Jr.]] of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/shared-blogs/ajc/politicalinsider/entries/2008/06/21/sclc_head_michelle_obama_treat.html |title=SCLC head: Michelle Obama treated more roughly than her husband, because of her slave heritage|work=Atlanta Journal Constitution-Ajc.com |date=June 21, 2008 |accessdate=April 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and African-American columnist [[David Ehrenstein]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times|LA Times]]'' who accused white liberals of flocking to blacks who were &quot;[[Magic Negro]]s&quot;, a term that refers to a black person with no past who simply appears to assist the mainstream white (as cultural protagonists/drivers) agenda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obama the 'Magic Negro'&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-ehrenstein19mar19,0,5335087.story?coll=la-opinion-center | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Obama the 'Magic Negro' | date=March 19, 2007 | first=David | last=Ehrenstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrenstein went on to say &quot;He's there to assuage white 'guilt' they feel over the role of slavery and racial segregation in American history.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Obama the 'Magic Negro'&quot;/&gt;

Former Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] (who was famously mistaken for a &quot;recent American immigrant&quot; by French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,309218,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Nicolas Sarkozy Mistakes Condoleezza Rice for Recent Immigrant | date=November 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; said &quot;descendants of slaves did not get much of a head start, and I think you continue to see some of the effects of that.&quot; She has also rejected an immigrant designation for African Americans and instead prefers the term &quot;black&quot; or &quot;white&quot; to denote the African and European U.S. founding populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bbaaghs.org/news/?p=10 |title=Book Excerpt: Condoleezza Rice: An American Life |author=Elisabeth Bumiller |date=December 22, 2007 |accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terms no longer in common use===
The terms [[mulatto]] and [[colored]] were widely used until the second quarter of the 20th century, when they were considered outmoded and generally gave way to the use of ''negro''. By the 1940s, the term commonly was capitalized, [[Negro]], but by the mid-1960s it was considered disparaging.  By the end of the 20th century &quot;Negro&quot; had come to be considered inappropriate and was rarely used and perceived as a pejorative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tottie |first=Gunnel |title=An Introduction to American English |url=http://books.google.com/?id=WWDUtK-f1tQC&amp;pg=PA200  |year=2002 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location=Oxford |isbn=0-631-19792-3 |page=200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Talmadge |author2=James Stewart |title=Introduction to African American Studies |url=http://books.google.com/?id=49tXR1Ok6poC&amp;pg=PA3 |year=2007 |publisher=Black Classics Press |location=Baltimore |isbn=1-58073-039-6 |page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is rarely used by younger black people, but remained in use by many older African Americans who had grown up with the term, particularly in the southern U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/03/they-put-negro-on-there/38094/ |title=They Put 'Negro' on There? |author=Chris Good |date=March 26, 2010 |work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''negro'' is the Spanish and Portuguese word for the color ''black''. In regions such as [[Latin America]] where these languages are spoken, ''negro'' (pronounced slightly differently from ''Negro'' in English), is a normal word used without disparaging intent in relation to black people.

There are many other deliberately insulting terms. Many were in common use (''e.g.'', &quot;[[nigger]]&quot;), but had become unacceptable in normal discourse before the end of the 20th century.
