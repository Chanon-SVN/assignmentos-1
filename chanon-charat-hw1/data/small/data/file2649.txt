'''Borneo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɔr|n|i|ˌ|oʊ}}) is the third-[[List of islands by area|largest island in the world]] and the largest island of [[Asia]]. At the geographic centre of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], in relation to major Indonesian islands, it is located north of [[Java Island|Java]], west of [[Sulawesi]], and east of [[Sumatra]].

The island is divided among three countries: [[Brunei]] and [[Malaysia]] in the north, and [[Indonesia]] to the south. Approximately 73% of the island is Indonesian territory. In the north, the [[East Malaysia]]n states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] make up about 26% of the island. Additionally, the Malaysian federal territory of [[Labuan]] is situated on a small island just off the coast of Borneo. The sovereign state of Brunei, located on the north coast, comprises about 1% of Borneo's land area. Borneo is home to one of the oldest [[Tropical rainforest|rainforests]] in the world.

==Etymology==
The island is known by many names; internationally it is known as ''Borneo'', after [[Empire of Brunei|Brunei]], derived from European historical contact with the kingdom in the 16th century during the [[Age of Exploration]]. The name ''Brunei'' possibly was initially derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word &quot;''{{transl|sa|varuṇ}}''&quot; ({{lang|sa|वरुण}}), meaning either &quot;ocean&quot; or the mythological [[Varuna]], the &quot;god of the ocean&quot;. [[Native Indonesian|Indonesian natives]] called it ''[[Kalimantan]],'' which was derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''Kalamanthana,'' meaning &quot;burning weather island&quot; (to describe its hot and humid [[tropical]] weather).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Central Kalimantan Province |publisher=archipelago fastfact |url=http://archipelagofastfact.wordpress.com/category/borneokalimantan/|accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to that, the island was also known by other names. In 977 CE, [[China|Chinese]] records began to use the term ''Po-ni'' to refer to Borneo. In 1225, it was also mentioned by Chinese official [[Zhao Rugua|Chua Ju-Kua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|History for Brunei|2009|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Javanese manuscript [[Nagarakretagama]], written by [[Majapahit]] court poet [[Mpu Prapanca]] in 1365, mentioned the island as ''Nusa Tanjungnagara'' which means the island where the [[Tanjungpura Kingdom]] located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Naskah Nagarakretagama | publisher= Perpustakaan Nasional Republik Indonesia | url=http://kelembagaan.pnri.go.id/Digital_Docs/homepage_folders/activities/highlight/naskah_nagara_kretagama/isi.htm |language=Indonesian | accessdate=13 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[Image:Mount kinabalu 01.png|thumb|left|[[Mount Kinabalu]]]]

{{nowrap|Borneo is surrounded}} by the [[South China Sea]] to the north and northwest, the [[Sulu Sea]] to the northeast, the [[Celebes Sea]] and the [[Makassar Strait]] to the east, and the [[Java Sea]] and [[Karimata Strait]] to the south. To the west of Borneo are the [[Malay Peninsula]] and [[Sumatra]]. To the south and east are islands of Indonesia: [[Java (island)|Java]] and [[Sulawesi]], respectively. To the northeast are the [[Philippines]].

With an area of {{convert|743330|km2|sqmi}}, it is the third-largest island in the world, and is the largest island of [[Asia]] (the largest continent). Its highest point is [[Mount Kinabalu]] in [[Sabah]], Malaysia, with an elevation of {{convert|4095|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/edens/borneo/awesome.html|title=An Awesome Island|work=Borneo: Island in the Clouds|publisher=PBS|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest river system is the [[Kapuas River|Kapuas]] in [[West Kalimantan]], with a length of {{convert|1143|km|abbr=on}}. Other major rivers include the [[Mahakam River|Mahakam]] in [[East Kalimantan]] ({{convert|980|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=mid|long}}), the [[Barito River|Barito]] in [[South Kalimantan]] ({{convert|880|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=mid|long}}), and [[Rajang River|Rajang]] in Sarawak ({{convert|562.5|km|abbr=on}}). {{cn|date=November 2014}}

Borneo has significant cave systems. Clearwater Cave, for example, has one of the world's longest underground rivers. [[Deer Cave]] is home to over three million [[bat]]s, with [[guano]] accumulated to over {{convert|100|m}} deep.&lt;ref&gt;BBC-TV: &quot;Borneo&quot;, ''Planet Earth''&lt;/ref&gt;

Before sea levels rose at the end of the last [[Ice Age]], Borneo was part of the mainland of Asia, forming, with [[Java]] and [[Sumatra]], the upland regions of a peninsula that extended east from present day [[Indochina]].  The [[South China Sea]] and [[Gulf of Thailand]] now submerge the former low-lying areas of the peninsula. Deeper waters separating Borneo from neighbouring [[Sulawesi]] prevented a land connection to that island, creating the divide between Asian and Australia-[[New Guinea]] biological regions, known as [[Wallace's Line]]. {{cn|date=November 2014}}

==Ecology==
{{see also|Deforestation in Borneo}}
[[File:Borneo logging 1926.jpg|thumb|right|A large log being placed on a railroad car at Batottan, British North Borneo in 1926]]

The Borneo rainforest is 140 million years old, making it one of the oldest rainforests in the world. There are about 15,000 species of [[flowering plant]]s with 3,000 species of trees (267 species are [[dipterocarp]]s), 221 species of terrestrial mammals and 420 species of resident birds in Borneo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacKinnon, K et al.|first=|title=The Ecology of Kalimantan|year=1998|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are about 440 freshwater fish species in Borneo (about the same as Sumatra and Java combined).&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen, T.T.T., and S. S. De Silva (2006). &quot;Freshwater Finfish Biodiversity and Conservation: An Asian Perspective&quot;, ''Biodiversity &amp; Conservation'' 15(11): 3543-3568&lt;/ref&gt; It is the centre of the evolution and distribution of many [[Endemism|endemic]] species of plants and animals. The Borneo [[rainforest]] is one of the few remaining [[Habitat (ecology)|natural habitats]] for the endangered [[Bornean orangutan]]. It is an important refuge for many [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] forest species, including the [[Asian elephant]], the [[Sumatran rhinoceros]], the [[Bornean clouded leopard]], the [[Hose's Palm Civet|Hose's civet]] and the [[dayak fruit bat]]. {{cn|date=November 2014}}

In 2010 the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] stated that 123 species have been discovered in Borneo since the &quot;Heart of Borneo&quot; agreement was signed in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwf.org.uk/wwf_articles.cfm?unewsid=3858|title=Scientists discover new species in Heart of Borneo|date=22 April 2010|publisher=WWF|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Borneo seen from space.jpg|thumb|left|True-colour satellite image of the island of Borneo on 14 May 2012, as taken by the [[Terra (satellite)|Terra satellite]]]]
The WWFN has classified the island into seven distinct [[ecoregion]]s. Most are lowland regions: {{cn|date=November 2014}}
* [[Borneo lowland rain forests]] cover most of the island, with an area of {{convert|427500|km2}};
* [[Borneo peat swamp forests]];
* ''[[Kerangas]]'' or Sundaland heath forests;
* Southwest Borneo freshwater swamp forests; and
* [[Sunda Shelf mangroves]].
* The [[Borneo montane rain forests]] lie in the central highlands of the island, above the {{convert|1000|m}} elevation. The highest elevations of [[Mount Kinabalu]] are home to the Kinabalu mountain [[alpine meadow]], an alpine shrubland notable for its numerous endemic species, including many orchids.

[[File:Peat Forest Swamp (10712654875).jpg|thumb|A peat forest in [[Kalimantan]]]]
The island historically had extensive rainforest cover, but the area was reduced due to [[Deforestation in Borneo|heavy logging]] for the Malaysian and Indonesian plywood industry.  Half of the annual global [[tropical timber]] acquisition comes from Borneo. [[Palm oil]] plantations have been widely developed and are rapidly encroaching on the last remnants of primary rainforest. Forest fires of 1997 to 1998, started by the locals to clear the forests for plantations were exacerbated by an exceptionally dry [[El Niño]] season, worsening the annual shrinkage of the rainforest. During these fires, hotspots were visible on [[Satellite imagery|satellite images]] and the resulting [[haze]] affected four countries: Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore. {{cn|date=November 2014}}

In 2010 Sarawak announced a plan for energy production, the [[Sarawak Corridor of Renewable Energy]], to try to establish sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livetradingnews.com/economy-malaysia-eyes-on-sarawak-25474.htm#.UXJPZpG9KK0|title=Economy Malaysia, Eyes on Sarawak|last=Shayne Heffernan|date=21 October 2010|publisher=Live Trading News|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early history===
According to ancient Chinese, Indian and Javanese manuscripts, western coastal cities of Borneo had become trading ports by the first millennium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soon2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Trade in Lakawood Products Between South China and the Malay World from the Twelfth to Fifteenth Centuries AD|author=Derek Heng Thiam Soon|journal=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies|volume=32|issue=2|pages=133–149|date=June 2001|doi=10.1017/S0022463401000066}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Chinese manuscripts, gold, [[camphor]], [[tortoise]] shells, [[hornbill ivory]], [[rhinoceros]] horn, [[Crane (bird)|crane crest]], [[beeswax]], lakawood (a scented heartwood and root wood of a thick [[liana]], ''Dalbergia parviflora''), [[dragon's blood]], [[rattan]], edible [[bird's nest soup|bird's nests]] and various spices were described as among the most valuable items from Borneo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Broek1962&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Place Names in 16th and 17th Century Borneo|author=Jan O. M. Broek|journal=Imago Mundi|volume=16|year=1962|pages=129–148|jstor=1150309|doi=10.1080/03085696208592208}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[demographics of India|Indians]] named Borneo ''Suvarnabhumi'' (the land of gold) and also ''Karpuradvipa'' (Camphor Island). The [[Javanese people|Javanese]] named Borneo ''Puradvipa'', or Diamond Island. [[Archaeological]] findings in the Sarawak river delta reveal that the area was a thriving trading centre between India and China from the 500s until about 1300 AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;Broek1962&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Dayaks in their war dress.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dayak people|Dayaks]], the natives of Borneo in their traditional war dress. [[Headhunting]] was an important part of Dayak culture.]]
One of the earliest evidence of [[Hindu]] influence in Southeast Asia were stone pillars which bear inscriptions in the [[Pallava script]], found in [[Kutai]] along the [[Mahakam River]] in [[East Kalimantan]], dating to around the second half of the 300s AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|work=The Austronesians: Historical and Comparative Perspectives|publisher=E Press, The Australian National University|title=(Chapter 15) The Earliest Indic State: Kutai|url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/austronesians/austronesians/mobile_devices/ch15s02.html|year=2006|accessdate=1 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 14th century, Borneo was under the control of the [[Majapahit|Majapahit kingdom]] based in present-day Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/malaysia/history-majapahit.htm|title=1350-1400 - Majapahit Empire|work=Military|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims entered the island and converted many of the indigenous peoples to Islam.

During the 1450s, Shari'ful Hashem Syed Abu Bakr, an Arab born in [[Johor]], arrived in Sulu from Malacca. In 1457, he founded the Sultanate of Sulu; he titled himself as &quot;Paduka Maulana Mahasari Sharif Sultan Hashem Abu Bakr&quot;. The Sultanate of Brunei, during its golden age from the 15th century to the 17th century, ruled a large part of northern Borneo. In 1703 (other sources say 1658), the [[Sulu Sultanate|Sultanate of Sulu]] received the eastern part of North Borneo from the Sultan of Brunei, after Sulu sent aid against a [[Brunei Civil War|rebellion]] in Brunei.

===Dutch and British control===

{{main|Dutch East Indies|British Borneo}}
[[File:British and Dutch Borneo, 1898.png|thumb|Map of the island divided between the Dutch and the British.]]
The Sultanate of Brunei granted large parts of land in Sarawak in 1842 to the English adventurer [[James Brooke]], as reward for his having helped quell a local rebellion. Brooke established the Kingdom of Sarawak and was recognised as its rajah after paying a fee to the Sultanate. He established a monarchy, and the Brooke dynasty (through his nephew and great-nephew) ruled Sarawak for 100 years; the leaders were known as the [[White Rajahs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://borneo.live.radicaldesigns.org/article.php?id=63|title=Part 2 - The Brooke Era|work=The Borneo Project|publisher=Earth Island Institute|accessdate=11 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, British and Dutch governments signed the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] to exchange trading ports under their controls and assert spheres of influence. This resulted in indirectly establishing British- and Dutch-controlled areas in Borneo, in the north and south, respectively. The [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and [[Iban people|Sea Dayak]] pirates preyed on maritime shipping in the waters between Singapore and Hong Kong from their haven in Borneo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.fullbooks.com/Wanderings-Among-South-Sea-Savages-And-in3.html|archiveurl=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2564/2564-h/2564-h.htm|archivedate=November 4, 2009|title=Wanderings Among South Sea Savages And in Borneo and the Philippines by H. Wilfrid Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[British North Borneo Company]] controlled the territory of North Borneo (present-day [[Sabah]]) from 1882 to 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb102-ms283792|title=British North Borneo Papers|work=School of Oriental and African Studies|publisher=Archives hub|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
{{See also|Japanese occupation of British Borneo|Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Pontianak incidents}}
During World War II, Japanese forces gained control and occupied Borneo (1941–45). They decimated many local populations and killed Malay intellectuals, executing all the Malay Sultans of Kalimantan in the [[Pontianak incidents]]. Sultan [[Muhammad Ibrahim Shafi ud-din II]] of [[Sultanate of Sambas|Sambas]] in [[Kalimantan]] was executed in 1944. The Sultanate was thereafter suspended and replaced by a Japanese council.&lt;ref&gt;http://pariwisata.kalbar.go.id/index.php?op=deskripsi&amp;u1=1&amp;u2=1&amp;idkt=4 {{dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Japanese occupation, the Dayak played a role in [[guerrilla]] warfare against the occupying forces, particularly in the Kapit Division. They temporarily revived [[headhunting]] of Japanese toward the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/11/09/opinion/edheiman.php 'Guests' can succeed where occupiers fail&quot;], ''New York Times'', 9 November 2007. {{Dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allied [[Z Special Unit]] provided assistance to them. After the [[Fall of Singapore]], the Japanese sent several thousand British and Australian [[prisoners of war]] to camps in Borneo. At one of the worst sites, around [[Sandakan]] in Borneo, only six of some 2,500 prisoners survived.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=ktCv32ysz0AC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Japanese Prisoners of War]''. Philip Towle, Margaret Kosuge, Yōichi Kibata (2000). [[Continuum International Publishing Group]]. pp.47–48. ISBN 1-85285-192-9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, the Japanese [[Borneo campaign (1945)|were defeated by the Allies]].

===Recent history===
Borneo was the main site of the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|confrontation]] between Indonesia and Malaysia between 1962 and about 1969. The [[British Army]] was deployed against the Indonesians and communist revolts to gain control of the whole area. Before the formation of Malaysian Federation, the [[Philippines]] claimed that the eastern part of the Malaysian state of Sabah was within their territory. They based this on the history of the Sultanate of Sulu's leasing agreement with the British North Borneo Company.

==Demographics==
The [[demonym]] for Borneo is '''Bornean''' or '''Bornese'''.

Borneo has 19.8 million inhabitants (in mid-2010), a population density of 26 inhabitants per square km. Most of the population lives in coastal cities, although the hinterland has small towns and villages along the rivers. The population consists mainly of [[Dayak people|Dayak]] ethnic groups, [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]], [[Banjar people|Banjar]], [[Orang Ulu(ethnic group)]], [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] and . The [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]], who make up 29% of the population of [[Sarawak]] and 17% of total population in [[West Kalimantan]], Indonesia&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.gdfao.gov.cn/english/relationship/fcp/200610130127.htm Province of West Kalimantan, Indonesia]&quot;. Guangdong Foreign Affairs Office.&lt;/ref&gt; are descendants of immigrants primarily from southeastern China.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/news/648273/ The world's successful diasporas&quot;], ''Management Today.'' 3 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The religion of the majority of the population in Kalimantan is [[Islam in Southeast Asia|Muslim]], and some indigenous groups continue to practice [[animism]]. But, approximately 91% of the Dayak are [[Christianity in Indonesia|Christian]], a religion introduced by [[missionaries]] in the 18th century. In [[Central Kalimantan]] is a small [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Hindu]] minority. In the interior of Borneo are the [[Penan]], some of who still live as nomadic [[hunter-gatherer]]s. Some coastal areas have marginal settlements of the [[Bajau]], who historically lived in a sea-oriented, boat-dwelling, nomadic culture. In the northwest of Borneo, the Dayak ethnic group is represented by the [[Iban people|Iban]], with about 930,000 members.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

In Kalimantan since the 1990s, the Indonesian government has undertaken an intense [[transmigration program]]; it financed the relocation to that area of poor, landless families from Java, Madura, and Bali. By 2001, transmigrants made up 21% of the population in [[Central Kalimantan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC|date=28 June 2004|accessdate=13 August 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3811219.stm|title=Indonesia flashpoints:, Kalimantan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1990s, the indigenous Dayak and Malays have resisted encroachment by these migrants: violent conflict has occurred between some transmigrant and indigenous populations. In the 1999 [[Sambas riots]], [[Dayak people|Dayaks]] and [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]] joined together to massacre thousands of the [[Madurese people|Madurese]] migrants. In Kalimantan, thousands were killed in 2001 fighting between [[Madurese transmigrant]]s and the Dayak people in the [[Sampit conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC|title=Beheading: A Dayak ritual|date=23 February 2001|accessdate=13 August 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1186401.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other instances, the district area is much larger than the actual city it represents thereby &quot;inflating&quot; the population by including the rural population living further outside the actual city—such as, but not limited to, Tawau and Palangkaraya. {{cn|date=November 2014}}
