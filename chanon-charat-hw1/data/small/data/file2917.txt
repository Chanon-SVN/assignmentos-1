'''''Bunnies &amp; Burrows''''' (''B&amp;B'') is a [[role-playing game]] (RPG) inspired by the novel ''[[Watership Down]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;GURPS&quot;&gt;''GURPS Bunnies &amp; Burrows'' (1992), [[Steve Jackson Games]], ISBN 978-1-55634-237-0&lt;/ref&gt; Published by [[Fantasy Games Unlimited]] in [[1976 in games|1976]], the game centered on intelligent [[rabbits]]. It introduced several innovations to role-playing game design, being the first game to allow players to have non-[[humanoid]] roles, and the first to have detailed [[martial arts]] and skill systems. Fantasy Games Unlimited published a second edition of the game in 1982, and the game was modified and republished by [[Steve Jackson Games]] as an official [[List of GURPS books|''GURPS'' supplement]] in 1992.

As [[rabbit]]s, [[player character]]s are faced with dangers mirroring those in the real world. The only true &quot;[[monster]]s&quot; in the game are humans, but there are many predators and natural hazards. The characters' position in the [[food chain]] promotes an emphasis on role-playing and problem solving over combat.

==History==

Originally published by [[Fantasy Games Unlimited]] in 1976, only two years after the first role-playing game ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' was published,&lt;ref name=&quot;sos&quot;/&gt; this edition is now long out of print. The game was inspired by [[Richard Adams]]' fantasy novel ''[[Watership Down]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Magill | first = Frank Northen | year = 1983 | title = Survey of Modern Fantasy Literature | publisher = [[Salem Press]] | isbn = 0-89356-450-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the players were given the opportunity to take on the role of rabbits.&lt;ref name=&quot;sos&quot;/&gt; As such, the game emphasized role-playing over combat for, according to [[Steffan O'Sullivan]], &quot;You're playing a rabbit, after all – how much combat do you want to do?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sos&quot;/&gt; The poor production values provided a barrier to the acceptance of the game. The art, by Charles Loving, was &quot;sketchy and of poor quality&quot;, while the document as a whole gave the appearance of having been [[Typewriter|typewritten]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rpgnet1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/reviews/rev_4598.html |title=Bunnies and Burrows |accessdate=2007-09-11 |author=Jason Morningstar |date=2001-08-07 |work= |publisher=[[RPGnet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Building on this first edition, in 1979, B. Dennis Sustare wrote ''&quot;Different Worlds Present the World of Druid's Valley: A Bunnies &amp; Burrows Campaign&quot;'' in ''[[Different Worlds]]'', a magazine published by [[Chaosium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nobleknight.com/ProductDetailSearch.asp_Q_ProductID_E_4939_A_InventoryID_E_2147574686_A_ProductLineID_E__A_ManufacturerID_E__A_CategoryID_E__A_GenreID_E_ |title= #3 &quot;Blackmoor, Bunnies &amp; Burrows Campaign&quot;|accessdate=2008-09-03 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Noble Knight Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; It detailed how to combine the world of ''Bunnies &amp; Burrows'' with other [[fantasy world]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sustare |first=B.

Maxfield, in ''Pegasus'', a magazine published by [[Judges Guild]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nobleknight.com/ProductDetailSearch.asp_Q_ProductID_E_3549_A_InventoryID_E_2147508749_A_ProductLineID_E__A_ManufacturerID_E__A_CategoryID_E__A_GenreID_E_ |title= #6 &quot;Traveller - Beastmaster Safari Ship, Gorean Chess&quot;|accessdate=2008-09-03 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Noble Knight Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A second edition of ''Bunnies &amp; Burrows'' was printed in 1982 by Fantasy Games Unlimited,&lt;ref name=&quot;pnp1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pen-paper.net/rpgdb.php?op=showbook&amp;bookid=2217 |title=Bunnies &amp; Burrows, 2nd Ed. (1982) |accessdate=2007-09-11 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Pen &amp; Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the continuing popularity of the first edition is evidenced by how it was still being actively played in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;played&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=385223|title=(B&amp;B 1st edition) - Hoppin' Mad! |accessdate=2008-09-02 |author= |date=2008-03-19 |work= |publisher=RPGnet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a rise of &quot;retro&quot; games in the late 1980s and early 1990s,&lt;ref name=&quot;ptgptb9&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ptgptb.org/0009/hist9.html |title=The History of Roleplaying |accessdate=2007-09-11 |author=Steve Darlington |date= |work= |publisher=Places to Go, People to Be (Issue 9, August 1999)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steve Jackson Games entered negotiations with Dennis Sustare and Scott Robinson, the current owners of the ''Bunnies &amp; Burrows'' copyright, to publish an official ''GURPS'' supplement.&lt;ref name=&quot;convert&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/articles/BnB.to.GURPS.html |title=B&amp;B to GURPS |accessdate=2008-09-02 |author=[[Steffan O'Sullivan]] |date=1988-11-30 |work= |publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, O'Sullivan wrote an unofficial conversion of ''Bunnies &amp; Burrows'' to ''[[GURPS]]'' while the negotiations continued.&lt;ref name=&quot;convert&quot;/&gt; He indicated that he hoped to one day work on the official supplement.&lt;ref name=&quot;convert&quot;/&gt; ''[[GURPS Bunnies &amp; Burrows]]'' was published in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;GURPS&quot; /&gt;

The setting also had an unofficial conversion in 2004 to be used in ''[[Risus|Risus: The Anything RPG]]'' by Boyd Mayberry&lt;ref name=&quot;risus&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mywebpages.comcast.net/boydmayberry/Bunnies.html |title=Risus Bunnies &amp; Burrows |accessdate=2007-09-11 |author=Boyd Mayberry |date=2004-04-09 |work= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; under their &quot;Rules for Free Fan-Supplements and Articles&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www222.pair.com/sjohn/risus-usage.htm |title=Legal Usage: Risus Fan-Material Policies |accessdate=2008-09-02 |author= |date=2007-01-24 |work= |publisher=Cumberland Games &amp; Diversions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
{{quote|
The original game was very innovative for its time (less than two years after the first published RPG). Not only could you play non-humanoids for the first time, but it was the first role-playing game to have detailed martial arts rules, the first attempt at a skill system, and the first RPG to appeal as widely to women as to men.&lt;ref name=&quot;sos&quot; /&gt;
}}

''Bunnies &amp; Burrows'' was the first role-playing game to allow for non-humanoid play.&lt;ref name=&quot;sos&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.panix.com/~sos/rpg/bunny.html|title=Bunnies &amp; Burrows|accessdate=2007-09-11|author=Steffan O'Sullivan|date=1998-06-20|publisher=SOS' Gameviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ptgptb3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ptgptb.org/0003/news3.html |title=RPG News |accessdate=2007-09-11 |author= |date=June 1998|issue=3 |work= |publisher=Places to Go, People to Be}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it was also the first role-playing game to have detailed martial arts rules (known as &quot;''Bun Fu''&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;rpgnet2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/12/12907.phtml |title=Review of GURPS Bunnies &amp; Burrows |accessdate=2007-09-11 |author=Lev Lafayette |date=2007-04-16 |work= |publisher=[[RPGnet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first attempt at a skill system.&lt;ref name=&quot;sos&quot;/&gt; For its time, the game was considered &quot;light years&quot; ahead of the [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons|Original ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;rpgnet1&quot;/&gt;

[[Player (game)|Players]] of ''Bunnies &amp; Burrows'' take the role of [[rabbit]]s as their [[player characters]]. Interaction with many different animal species is part of normal gameplay. [[Human]]s, whose thought processes and motivations are completely [[Alien (signifier)|alien]], are the only monster to be encountered.&lt;ref name=&quot;rollsite&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://translate.google.com/translate?sourceid=navclient&amp;hl=en&amp;u=http%3a%2f%2fwww%2eroliste%2ecom%2fdetail%2ejsp%3fid%3d8166 |title=Bunnies &amp; Burrows (French) |accessdate=2007-09-11 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Rollsite}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bunnies &amp; Burrows'' has the advantage of offering players an intuitive grasp of relative dangers and appropriate actions not possible in [[Fictional universe|game worlds]] that are substantially fictional. For example, a player is told their character is confronted with a [[fox]]. There is an immediate intuition on the amount of peril a rabbit is facing. Although player characters are substantially weaker than many of the dangers they face, the game is one of the first to encourage problem solving and outwitting obstacles, rather than out-fighting them.&lt;ref name=&quot;rollsite&quot;/&gt;

The mechanics of the [[role-playing game system]] were created specifically for ''Bunnies &amp; Burrows'', common at the time of its original publishing. It features eight [[statistic (role-playing games)|abilities]] and eight [[character class|classes]]. The task resolution system is based on rolls of [[percentile dice]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rollsite&quot;/&gt; Although newer systems have updated game mechanics significantly, the ideas presented in ''Bunnies &amp; Burrows'' created the framework for modern role-playing games.&lt;ref name=&quot;played&quot;/&gt;

==Reception==
Although the game had &quot;incredible role-playing potential&quot;, the concept of role-playing rabbits can be viewed as bizarre, and as such at least one commentator believes that &quot;most people thought it was stupid&quot; when it was first released.&lt;ref name=&quot;Astinus&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Astinus | url = http://ptgptb.org/0003/hist3.html | title = The History of Roleplaying | accessdate = 2008-09-12 | date = June 1998 |work = Places to Go, People to Be  | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is mirrored by Lev Lafayette, who, when describing his first exposure to the game, says &quot;Oh, how we laughed. 'Who on earth would want to roleplay a rabbit?', we mocked. 'What's the point? You can't do anything!'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rpgnet2&quot; /&gt;
