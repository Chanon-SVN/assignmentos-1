'''Active Server Pages''' ('''ASP'''), also known as ''Classic ASP'' or ''ASP Classic'', was [[Microsoft]]'s first [[server-side scripting|server-side]] [[Active Scripting|script engine]] for [[dynamic web page|dynamically generated web pages]]. Initially released as an add-on to [[Internet Information Services]] (IIS) via the [[Windows_NT_4.0#Option_Pack|Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack]] (ca. 1996), it was subsequently included as a free component of Windows Server (since the initial release of [[Windows 2000 Server]]). [[ASP.NET]], first released in January 2002, has superseded ASP.

ASP 2.0 provided six [[Wiktionary:built-in|built-in]] [[Object (computer science)|objects]]: Application, ASPError, Request, Response, Server, and Session. &lt;code&gt;Session&lt;/code&gt;, for example, represents a [[Session (computer science)|session]] that maintains the state of [[Variable (programming)|variables]] from page to page.&lt;ref&gt;The session data is kept server-side, the ID is saved as a [[HTTP Cookie]]. Source: [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms972338.aspx ASP and Web Session Management], Microsoft&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Active Scripting]] engine's support of the [[Component Object Model]] (COM) enables ASP [[website]]s to access functionality in compiled [[Library (computing)|libraries]] such as [[Dynamic-link library|DLLs]].

ASP 3.0 does not differ greatly from ASP 2.0 but it does offer some additional enhancements such as: Server.Transfer method, Server.Execute method, and an enhanced ASPError object. ASP 3.0 also enabled buffering by default and optimized the engine for better performance.

The use of ASP pages with [[Internet Information Services]] (IIS) is currently supported on all supported versions of IIS. The use of ASP pages will be supported on [[Windows 8]] for a minimum of 10 years from the [[Windows 8]] release date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2669020 | title=Active Server Pages (ASP) support in Windows}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Web pages with the ''.asp'' [[file extension]] use ASP, although some web sites disguise their choice of scripting language for security purposes (e.g. still using the more common ''.htm'' or ''.html'' extension).
Pages with the ''.aspx'' extension use compiled [[ASP.NET]] (based on Microsoft's [[.NET Framework]]), which makes them faster and more robust than [[server-side scripting]] in ASP, which is interpreted at run-time; however, ASP.NET pages may still include some ASP scripting. The introduction of ASP.NET led to use of the term ''Classic ASP'' for the original technology.

Programmers write most ASP pages using [[VBScript]], but any other Active Scripting engine can be selected instead with the &lt;tt&gt;@Language&lt;/tt&gt; directive or the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;script language=&quot;manu&quot; runat=&quot;server&quot;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; syntax. [[JScript]] (Microsoft's implementation of [[ECMAScript]]) is the other language that is usually available. [[PerlScript]] (a derivative of [[Perl]]) and others are available as third-party installable Active Scripting engines.

== Releases ==
There have been three versions of ASP, each introduced with different versions of IIS&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visualsolutions-co.com/services/what-is-asp.php&lt;/ref&gt;

* ASP 1.0 - released December 1996 as part of IIS 3.0
* ASP 2.0 - released September 1997 as part of IIS 4.0
* ASP 3.0 - released November 2000 as part of IIS 5.0

It was subsequently deprecated{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} in favour of Microsoft's [[.NET framework]] and [[ASP.NET]], the original release of which was in January 2002.

== Usage ==

=== VBScript ===
Using [[VBScript]] in ASP pages is very simple. The interpreter replaces all the code in between the &lt;% and %&gt; tags. In the example below, Response.Write Now() is dynamically replaced by the current time of the server.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;The current time&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
The server's current time:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;%
Response.Write Now()
%&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===The Request object===
Allows data to be read that was sent by the client browser: Form, [[Querystring]], and [[HTTP Cookie]]. It also provides information on the server, the client browser, and retrieve [[HTTP Cookie]] stored on the visitor's machine. Can retrieve data from a form using both methods [[HTTP]]:

Request.Form reads data sent by POST.

Request.QueryString reads data sent by GET.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
&lt;%
Response.Write(&quot;Welcome &quot; &amp; Request.QueryString(&quot;name&quot;) &amp; &quot;!&quot;) 'this script is vulnerable to XSS, the input has not been encoded (see below)
%&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===The Response object===
Can send information to the client, such as the writing of the text on a page or [[HTTP Cookie]].

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
&lt;%
If (Len(Request.QueryString(&quot;name&quot;)) &gt; 0) Then
     Response.Cookies(&quot;name&quot;) = Request.QueryString(&quot;name&quot;) 
End If

Response.Write(&quot;Welcome &quot; &amp; Response.Cookies(&quot;name&quot;) &amp; &quot;!&quot;) 'this script is vulnerable to XSS, the input has not been encoded (see below)
%&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
&lt;%
If (Len(Request.QueryString(&quot;name&quot;)) &gt; 0) Then
     Response.Cookies(&quot;name&quot;) = Request.QueryString(&quot;name&quot;) 
End If

Response.Write(&quot;Welcome &quot; &amp; Server.HTMLEncode(Response.Cookies(&quot;name&quot;)) &amp; &quot;!&quot;) 'this script is NOT vulnerable to XSS, the input has been encoded using HTML Encoding.
%&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===The Server object===
Allows connections to databases (ADO), filesystem, and use of components installed on the server.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
&lt;%
Dim oAdoCon, oAdoRec, oAdoStm, oCdoCon, oCdoMsg, oSciDic, oSciFsm, oMswAdr

Set oAdoCon = Server.CreateObject(&quot;ADODB.Connection&quot;)
Set oAdoRec = Server.CreateObject(&quot;ADODB.Recordset&quot;)
Set oAdoStm = Server.CreateObject(&quot;ADODB.Stream&quot;)
Set oCdoCon = Server.CreateObject(&quot;CDO.Configuration&quot;)
Set oCdoMsg = Server.CreateObject(&quot;CDO.Message&quot;)
Set oSciDic = Server.CreateObject(&quot;Scripting.Dictionary&quot;)
Set oSciFsm = Server.CreateObject(&quot;Scripting.FileSystemObject&quot;)
Set oMswAdr = Server.CreateObject(&quot;MSWC.AdRotator&quot;)
%&gt; 
&lt;/source&gt;

===The Application object===
Stores global variables.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
&lt;%
Application(&quot;Ali&quot;) = &quot;My ASP Application&quot;
Response.Write(&quot;Welcome to &quot; &amp; Application(&quot;Ali&quot;) &amp; &quot;!&quot;)
%&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===The Session object===
Stores variables accessible only to a single visitor.

&lt;source lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
&lt;%
If (Len(Request.QueryString(&quot;name&quot;)) &gt; 0) Then
     Session(&quot;name&quot;) = Request.QueryString(&quot;name&quot;) 
End If

Response.Write(&quot;Welcome &quot; &amp; Server.HTMLEncode(Session(&quot;name&quot;)) &amp; &quot;!&quot;) 'this script is NOT vulnerable to XSS, the input has been encoded using HTML Encoding
%&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===The Error object===
Allows for the management of errors.

&lt;source Lang=&quot;asp&quot;&gt;
&lt;%
On Error Resume Next

Dim o_Error
Set o_Error = Server.GetLastError()

Response.Write(&quot;Asp Code: &quot; &amp; o_Error.AspCode &amp; &quot;&lt;BR /&gt;&quot;)
Response.Write(&quot;Asp Description: &quot; &amp; o_Error.AspDescription &amp; &quot;&lt;BR /&gt;&quot;)
Response.Write(&quot;Category: &quot; &amp; o_Error.Category &amp; &quot;&lt;BR /&gt;&quot;)
Response.Write(&quot;Column: &quot; &amp; o_Error.Column &amp; &quot;&lt;BR /&gt;&quot;)
Response.Write(&quot;Description: &quot; &amp; o_Error.Description &amp; &quot;&lt;BR /&gt;&quot;)
Response.Write(&quot;File: &quot; &amp; o_Error.File &amp; &quot;&lt;BR /&gt;&quot;)
Response.Write(&quot;Line: &quot; &amp; o_Error.Line &amp; &quot;&lt;BR /&gt;&quot;)
Response.Write(&quot;Number: &quot; &amp; o_Error.Number &amp; &quot;&lt;BR /&gt;&quot;)
Response.Write(&quot;Source: &quot; &amp; o_Error.Source &amp; &quot;&quot;)

If (Err.Number &lt;&gt; 0) Then 
     Err.Clear 
End If 
%&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==ASP on non-Microsoft Operating Systems==
Microsoft's ASP technology runs only on Windows platforms.  A number of products emulate some of the functionality of Classic ASP on non-Microsoft web servers.  Apache::ASP for example ports Classic ASP to the Apache Web Server, but does not interpret Visual Basic or other scripting languages supported by ASP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apache::ASP|url=http://www.apache-asp.org/index.html|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sun Java System ASP (formerly ChiliSoft ASP) was a popular and reportedly complete emulator,&lt;ref name=&quot;Weissinger2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Weissinger|first=Keyton |title=ASP in a Nutshell: A Desktop Quick Reference|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=tUHeRwhGKcgC|accessdate=9 October 2013|date=6 October 2009|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4493-7959-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it has been discontinued.
