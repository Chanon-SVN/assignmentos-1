'''Apollo 7''' was a 1968 [[human spaceflight]] mission carried out by the [[United States of America]]. It was the first mission in the United States' [[Apollo program]] to carry a crew into space. It was also the first American space flight to carry astronauts since the flight of [[Gemini 12|Gemini XII]] in November 1966; the [[Apollo 1|AS-204 mission]], also known as &quot;Apollo 1&quot;, had been intended to fulfil the objective of the first manned flight of Apollo in February 1967, but the fire that had killed the crew led to manned flights being suspended for 19 months. Instead, Apollo 7 carried out the mission that Apollo 1 was scheduled to do. The crew was commanded by [[Wally Schirra|Walter M. Schirra]], with Command Module Pilot [[Donn F. Eisele]], and Lunar Module Pilot [[Walter Cunningham|R. Walter Cunningham]].

It was [[List of Apollo mission types|Apollo's 'C' mission]], an 11-day Earth-orbital test flight to check out the redesigned Block II [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] (CSM) with a crew on board. It was the first launch of a [[Saturn IB]] vehicle to put a crew into space, the first three-person American space mission, and the first live TV broadcast from an American spacecraft. It was successfully launched on October 11, 1968, from what was then known as [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Kennedy Air Force Station]], Florida. Despite tension between the crew and ground controllers, the mission was a complete technical success, giving [[NASA]] the confidence to launch [[Apollo 8]] around the [[Moon]] two months later. However, the flight would prove to be the last NASA space flight for all of its three crew members when it splashed down in the Atlantic Ocean on October 22, 1968. It was also the final [[Human spaceflight|manned]] launch from Cape Kennedy Air Force Station.

==Background==

[[File:Apollo 7 Launch - GPN-2000-001171.jpg|thumb|Apollo 7's liftoff]]
Schirra, Eisele, and Cunningham were first named as an Apollo crew on September 29, 1966. They were to fly a second Earth orbital test of the original Block I Command/Service module (not designed to dock with the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] for lunar flight,) after [[Apollo 1]], the first manned flight, to be made by [[Gus Grissom|Virgil &quot;Gus&quot; Grissom]], [[Edward Higgins White|Edward H. White]], and [[Roger Chaffee]]. In December 1966, the second mission was deemed redundant and canceled, and Schirra's crew were reassigned as Grissom's backup.

Plans for the first manned Apollo flights were completely disrupted by the January 27, 1967 cabin fire which killed Grissom, White, and Chaffee. Schirra, Eisele, and Cunningham were later named as prime crew for the first manned flight, which would now use the Block II spacecraft designed for the lunar missions. The [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Command Module (CM)|Command Module]] (CM) and astronauts' spacesuits had been extensively redesigned, to reduce and eliminate the chance of a repeat of the accident which killed the first crew. Schirra thus became the only astronaut to fly [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], [[Project Gemini|Gemini]] and Apollo missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schirra's Obituary&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Watkins |first=Thomas |date=May 3, 2007 |title=Astronaut Walter Schirra dies at 84 |url=http://www.valleymorningstar.com/news/latest_news/article_b5ab61b9-cbe9-5db5-b76f-8cfd89096919.html |newspaper=[[Valley Morning Star]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |location=Harlingen, Texas |accessdate=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His crew would test the life support, propulsion, guidance and control systems during this &quot;open-ended&quot; mission (meaning it would be extended as it passed each test). The duration was limited to 11 days, reduced from the original 14-day limit for Apollo 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Karrens |first=Ed (Announcer) |year=1968 |title=1968 Year in Review: 1968 in Space |url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/Audio/Events-of-1968/1968-in-Space |work=UPI.com |type=Radio transcript |publisher=[[E. W. Scripps]] |agency=[[United Press International]] |accessdate=July 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it flew in [[low Earth orbit]] and did not include the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM), Apollo 7 was launched with the Saturn IB booster rather than the much larger and more powerful [[Saturn V]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Saturn IB history&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Portree |first=David S. F. |date=September 16, 2013 |title=A Forgotten Rocket: The Saturn IB |url=http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/09/a-forgotten-rocket-the-saturn-ib/ |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |location=New York |publisher=[[Cond√© Nast]] |accessdate=October 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Mercury and Gemini programs, [[McDonnell Aircraft]] engineer [[Guenter Wendt]] had been leader of the spacecraft launch pad teams, with ultimate responsibility for condition of the spacecraft at launch. He earned the astronauts' respect and admiration, including Schirra's.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guenter Wendt Obit&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-050310a.html |title=Guenter Wendt, 86, 'Pad Leader' for NASA's moon missions, dies |last=Pearlman |first=Robert Z. |authorlink=Robert Pearlman |date=May 3, 2010 |website=[[collectSPACE]] |publisher=Robert Pearlman |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the spacecraft contractor had changed from McDonnell (Mercury &amp; Gemini) to [[Rockwell International|North American Rockwell]] (Apollo), so Wendt was not the pad leader for Apollo 1.&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstOnTheMoon&quot;&gt;[[#Farmer &amp; Hamblin 1970|Farmer &amp; Hamblin 1970]], pp. 51‚Äì54&lt;/ref&gt;

So adamant was Schirra in his desire to have Wendt back as Pad Leader for his Apollo flight, that he got his boss [[Deke Slayton]] to persuade North American management to hire Wendt away from McDonnell, and Schirra personally lobbied North American's launch operations manager to change Wendt's shift from midnight to day so he could be pad leader for Apollo 7. Wendt remained as Pad Leader for the entire Apollo program.&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstOnTheMoon&quot; /&gt;

==Mission highlights==

Wendt's face was the last they saw before the hatch was sealed, and immediately after liftoff Eisele said with a mock German accent into his radio, &quot;I vonder vere Guenter Vendt?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstOnTheMoon&quot; /&gt;

===On-orbit operations===
[[File:Apollo 7 Rondevouz.jpg|thumb|Close-up of the [[S-IVB]] stage during rendezvous maneuvers. Note the right-hand adapter panel is not fully opened to the same angle as the others]]
Following orbital injection and separation from the [[S-IVB]], the crew turned the CSM around using its [[Reaction control system|Reaction Control System]] thrusters and practiced a simulated Lunar Module rendezvous and docking. One of the adapter panels on the S-IVB failed to completely deploy to its 45 degree open position, reminding [[Flight controller#Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM)|CAPCOM]] [[Tom Stafford]] of his &quot;angry alligator&quot; experience on [[Gemini 9A]], when docking was prevented by mis-deployed adapter panels. Had this been an actual lunar mission, the astronauts would have found the process of LM extraction from the adapter more difficult, risking possible damage. This reinforced the decision to add a system to completely separate and jettison the panels on all subsequent Apollo-Saturn V flights.&lt;ref name=&quot;astronautix.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/flights/apollo7.htm |title=Apollo 7 |last=Wade |first=Mark |website=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]] |accessdate=October 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apollo hardware and all mission operations worked without any significant problems, and the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Service Propulsion System|Service Propulsion System]] (SPS), the all-important engine that would place Apollo into and out of lunar orbit, made eight firings, performing within one percent of the engine acceptance test thrust and [[specific impulse]] values. As the Saturn IB itself had performed very smoothly during launch, the astronauts were unprepared for the sudden violent jolt they received upon first activating the SPS, leading to Schirra yelling &quot;Yabbadabbadoo!&quot; in reference to ''[[The Flintstones]]'' cartoon. Don Eisele called it &quot;a real boot in the rear.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19760072144_1976072144.pdf |title= Apollo 7 Mission Report |date= December 1, 1968 | publisher=NASA |pages=5‚Äì158 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early fears that the movement of the astronauts inside the CM would make it hard for the spacecraft's attitude control system to stabilize it proved unfounded, and they reported that motion was &quot;incredibly easy&quot; with no gravity to work against. As sleeping in the fetal position was cramping and painful, an exercise device called the Exer-Genie was provided.&lt;ref name=&quot;astronautix.com&quot; /&gt;

Another mission goal was the first [[Apollo TV camera|live television]] [[broadcasting|broadcast]] from an American spacecraft ([[Gordon Cooper]] had transmitted [[Slow-scan television|slow scan television]] pictures from [[Mercury-Atlas 9|''Faith 7'']] in 1963, which were never broadcast).&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollo video camera&quot;&gt;[[#Steven-Boniecki 2010|Steven-Boniecki 2010]], pp. 55‚Äì58&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially scheduled for midday on day two, but Schirra was concerned with the broadcast interfering with the [[Space rendezvous|rendezvous]] test.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schirra Cancels TV&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Schirra rules no telecast |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=UjQ_AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cVEMAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=apollo%207%20television%20broadcast&amp;pg=1799%2C3226547 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |newspaper=[[Windsor Star|The Windsor Star]] |date=October 12, 1968 |agency=United Press International |location=Windsor, Ontario |page=1 |accessdate=October 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;Mutiny&quot; in space===
Even though Apollo's larger cabin was more comfortable than Gemini's, 11 days in orbit took its toll on the astronauts. Tension with Schirra began with the launch decision, when flight managers decided to launch with a less than ideal abort option for the early part of the ascent. Once in orbit, the spacious cabin may have induced some crew [[motion sickness]], which had not been an issue in the earlier, smaller spacecraft. The crew was unhappy with their food selections, especially the high energy sweets. They also found the waste collection system cumbersome (requiring 30 minutes to use) and smelly. But the worst problem occurred when Schirra developed a severe [[Common cold|head cold]]. As a result, he became irritable with requests from [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center#Gemini and Apollo (1965-1975)|Mission Control]] and all three astronauts began &quot;talking back&quot; to the CAPCOM. An early example was this exchange after Mission Control requested that a TV camera be turned on in the spacecraft:
[[Image:Walter Schirra on Apollo 7.jpg|thumb|[[Walter Schirra]] looks out the rendezvous window in front of the commander's station on the ninth day of the mission]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
SCHIRRA: You've added two burns to this flight schedule, and you've added a urine water dump; and we have a new vehicle up here, and I can tell you at this point TV will be delayed without any further discussion until after the rendezvous.&lt;br /&gt;
CAPCOM ([[Jack Swigert]]): Roger. Copy.&lt;br /&gt;
SCHIRRA: Roger.&lt;br /&gt;
CAPCOM 1 ([[Deke Slayton]]): Apollo 7, this is CAPCOM number 1.&lt;br /&gt;
SCHIRRA: Roger.&lt;br /&gt;
CAPCOM 1: All we've agreed to do on this is flip it. &lt;br /&gt;
SCHIRRA: ... with two commanders, Apollo 7&lt;br /&gt;
CAPCOM 1: All we have agreed to on this particular pass is to flip the switch on. No other activity is associated with TV; I think we are still obligated to do that.&lt;br /&gt;
SCHIRRA: We do not have the equipment out; we have not had an opportunity to follow setting; we have not eaten at this point. At this point, I have a cold. I refuse to foul up our time lines this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/AS07_TEC.PDF |title=Apollo 7 Air-to-Ground Voice Transcriptions |publisher=NASA |pages=117‚Äì118 |format=PDF |accessdate=October 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A further source of tension between Mission Control and the crew was that Schirra repeatedly expressed the view that the reentry should be conducted with their helmets off, contrary to previous Project Mercury and Gemini experience. They perceived a risk that their eardrums might burst due to the sinus pressure from their colds, and they wanted to be able to pinch their noses and blow to equalize the pressure as it increased during reentry. This would have been impossible wearing the helmets, as the new Apollo helmets were a continuous &quot;fishbowl&quot; type without a moveable visor, unlike previous helmets. However, on repeated occasions over the course of the mission, Schirra was instructed that the helmets should be worn for safety reasons. In the final exchange on the subject, Mission Control made it clear to Schirra that he would be expected to account for flouting instructions:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
CAPCOM Number 1 (Deke Slayton): Okay. I think you ought to clearly understand there is absolutely no experience at all with landing without the helmet on. &lt;br /&gt;
SCHIRRA: And there no experience with the helmet either on that one. &lt;br /&gt;
CAPCOM: That one we've got a lot of experience with, yes. &lt;br /&gt;
SCHIRRA: If we had an open visor, I might go along with that. &lt;br /&gt;
CAPCOM: Okay. I guess you better be prepared to discuss in some detail when we land why we haven't got them on. I think you're too late now to do much about it. &lt;br /&gt;
SCHIRRA: That's affirmative. I don't think anybody down there has worn the helmets as much as we have. &lt;br /&gt;
CAPCOM: Yes. &lt;br /&gt;
SCHIRRA: We tried them on this morning. &lt;br /&gt;
CAPCOM: Understand that. The only thing we're concerned about is the landing. We couldn't care less
about the reentry. But it's your neck, and I hope you don't break it. &lt;br /&gt;
SCHIRRA: Thanks, babe. &lt;br /&gt;
CAPCOM: Over and out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/history/mission_trans/AS07_TEC.PDF |title=Apollo 7 Air-to-Ground Voice Transcriptions |publisher=NASA |page=1170 |format=PDF |accessdate=October 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Exchanges such as this led to Eisele and Cunningham being rejected for future missions (Schirra had already announced his impending retirement from NASA).&lt;ref name=&quot;astronautix.com&quot; /&gt;

===Reentry and post-flight evaluation===

The splashdown point was {{coord|27|32|N|64|04|W}}, {{convert|200|nmi|km}} SSW of [[Bermuda]] and {{convert|7|nmi|km|abbr=on}} north of the recovery ship [[USS Essex (CV-9)|USS ''Essex'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;astronautix.com&quot; /&gt;

Despite the difficulties between the crew and Mission Control, the mission successfully met its objectives to verify the Apollo Command and Service Modules' flight worthiness, allowing Apollo 8's flight to the Moon to proceed just two months later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollo Crew Honored 2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-102008a.html |title=First Apollo flight crew last to be honored |last=Pearlman |first=Robert Z. |date=October 20, 2008 |website=collectSPACE |publisher=Robert Pearlman |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apollo 7 was Project Apollo's only human spaceflight mission to launch from Cape Kennedy Air Force Station's [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Launch Complex 34|Launch Complex 34]].&lt;ref&gt;The Air Force Station was originally named Cape Canaveral, but the name was changed to Cape Kennedy by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] shortly after President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s death in November 1963. The name ''Canaveral'' was reverted in 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; All subsequent Apollo and [[Skylab]] missions (including [[Apollo‚ÄìSoyuz Test Project|Apollo‚ÄìSoyuz]]) were launched from [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|Launch Complex 39]] at the nearby [[Kennedy Space Center]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Saturn IB history&quot; /&gt; Launch Complex 34 was declared redundant and decommissioned in 1969, making Apollo 7 the last human spaceflight mission to launch from Cape Canaveral in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Saturn IB history&quot; /&gt; As of 2014, Cunningham is the only surviving member of the crew.

The patch was designed by Allen Stevens of [[Rockwell International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.collectspace.com/news/news-052008a.html |title=The man behind the Moon mission patches |last=Hengeveld |first=Ed |date=May 20, 2008 |website=collectSPACE |publisher=Robert Pearlman |accessdate=July 6, 2013}} &quot;A version of this article was published concurrently in the [[British Interplanetary Society]]'s ''[[Spaceflight (magazine)|Spaceflight]]'' magazine.&quot; (June 2008; pp. 220‚Äì225).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crew honors==

After the mission, NASA awarded Schirra, Eisele, and Cunningham its [[NASA Exceptional Service Medal|Exceptional Service Medal]] in recognition of their success. On November 2, 1968, President [[Lyndon Johnson]] held a ceremony at the [[LBJ Ranch]] in Johnson City, Texas, to present the astronauts with the medals. He also presented NASA's highest honor, the [[NASA Distinguished Service Medal|Distinguished Service Medal]], to recently retired NASA administrator James E. Webb, for his &quot;outstanding leadership of America's space program&quot; since the beginning of Apollo.&lt;ref&gt;Speech given by President Lyndon B. Johnson addressed to the astronauts of the Apollo 7 flight. See site for the full account of the recorded speech. Retrieved December 8, 2014. http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=29220&lt;/ref&gt;

Schirra, Eisele, and Cunningham were the only crew, of all the Apollo, [[Skylab]], and [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]] missions, who had not been awarded the Distinguished Service Medal immediately following their missions (though Schirra had received the medal twice before, for his Mercury and Gemini missions). Therefore, NASA administrator [[Michael D. Griffin]] decided to belatedly award the medals to the crew in October 2008,  &quot;[f]or exemplary performance in meeting all the Apollo 7 mission objectives and more on the first manned Apollo mission, paving the way for the first flight to the Moon on Apollo 8 and the first manned lunar landing on Apollo 11.&quot; Only Cunningham was still alive at the time; Eisele's widow accepted his medal, and [[Apollo 8]] crew member [[Bill Anders]] accepted Shirra's. Other Apollo astronauts, including [[Neil Armstrong]], [[Buzz Aldrin]], and [[Alan Bean]], were present at the award ceremony. Former [[Flight controller#Flight Director (FLIGHT)|Flight Director]] [[Christopher C. Kraft, Jr.]], who had been in conflict with the crew during the mission, sent a conciliatory video message of congratulations, saying: &quot;We gave you a hard time once but you certainly survived that and have done extremely well since...I am frankly, very proud to call you a friend.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Apollo Crew Honored 2008&quot; /&gt;

In January 1969, the Apollo 7 Command Module was displayed on a NASA float in the inauguration parade of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard M. Nixon]]. For nearly 30 years the Command Module was on loan (renewable every two years) to the [[Canada Science and Technology Museum|National Museum of Science and Technology]], in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], along with the space suit worn by [[Wally Schirra]]. In November 2003, the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in Washington, D.C., requested them back for display at their new annex at the [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]]. Currently, the Apollo 7 CM is on loan to the [[Frontiers of Flight Museum]] located next to [[Dallas Love Field|Love Field]] in [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], [[Texas]].

The Apollo 7 mission is dramatized in the 1998 miniseries [[From the Earth to the Moon (TV miniseries)|''From the Earth to the Moon'']] episode &quot;We Have Cleared the Tower&quot;, with [[Mark Harmon]] as Schirra, John Mese as Eisele, [[Fredric Lehne]] as Cunningham, and [[Max Wright]] as Wendt.
