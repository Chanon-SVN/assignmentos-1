'''Antoine Thomson d'Abbadie d'Arrast''' (3 January 1810 – 19 March 1897)&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; was a French explorer, [[geographer]], [[ethnologist]], [[linguist]] and [[astronomer]] notable for his travels in [[Ethiopia]]&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Although referred to as Ethiopia here, the region that they traveled is more accurately defined as [[Abyssinia]] or in today's geography nothern Ethiopia and [[Eritrea]].&lt;/ref&gt; during the first half of the 19th century. He was the older brother of [[Arnaud Michel d'Abbadie]], with whom he traveled.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thorne|1984|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born in the Irish city of [[Dublin]] from a partially [[Basque people|Basque]] noble family of the [[Provinces of France|French province]] of [[Soule]]. His father, Michel Abbadie, was born in [[Arrast-Larrebieu]] and his mother was Irish. His grandfather Jean-Pierre was an [[abbot]] and a [[Notary public|notary]] in Soule. The family moved to France in 1818 where the brothers received a careful scientific education.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|The date of the move to France by the family is given as 1820 by some.&lt;ref name=ww/&gt;}} In 1827, Antoine received a bachelier (bachelor) degree in [[Toulouse]].&lt;ref name=ww&gt;{{harvnb|Debus|Calinger|Collins|Kennedy|1968|p=400}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1829, he began his education in [[Paris]], where he studied law.&lt;ref name=ww/&gt;

He married Virginie Vincent de Saint-Bonnet on 21 February 1859,&lt;ref name=ww/&gt; and settled in [[Hendaye]] where he purchased 250[[Hectare|ha]] to build a castle, and became the mayor of the city from 1871 to 1875.

Abbadie was a knight of the [[Légion d’honneur|Legion of Honour]], which he received on 27 September 1850,&lt;ref name=ww/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anon|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]. He died in 1897, and bequeathed the Abbadi domain and castle in Hendaye, yielding 40,000 francs a year, to the Academy of Sciences.

== Science and explorations ==
In 1835 the [[French Academy]] sent Antoine on a scientific mission to Brazil, the results being published at a later date (1873)&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|The date of the trip to Brazil is stated as 1836 by some sources.&lt;ref name=ww/&gt;}} under the title of ''Observations relatives à la physique du globe faites au Brésil et en Éthiopie''. In 1837, the two brothers started for Ethiopia, landing at [[Massawa]] in February 1838.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; They journeyed throughout Ethiopia, travelling as far south as the [[Kingdom of Kaffa]], sometimes together and sometimes separately. In addition to his studies in the sciences, he delved into the political fray exerting influence in favor of France and the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] missionaries.&lt;ref name=ce&gt;{{harvnb|Shahan|1907}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Ethiopia they returned to France in 1848 with notes on the geography, geology, archaeology, and natural history of the region.&lt;ref name=eb11/&gt;

Antoine became involved in various controversies relating both to his geographical results and his political intrigues. He was especially attacked by [[Charles Tilstone Beke]], who impugned his veracity, especially with reference to the journey to [[Kana, Ethiopia|Kana]]. But time and the investigations of subsequent explorers have shown that Abbadie was quite trustworthy as to his facts, though wrong in his contention—hotly contested by Beke—that the [[Blue Nile]] was the main stream. The topographical results of his explorations were published in Paris between 1860 and 1873&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; in ''Géodésie d'Éthiopie'', full of the most valuable information and illustrated by ten maps. Of the ''Géographie de l'Éthiopie'' (Paris, 1890)&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; only one volume was published. In ''Un Catalogue raisonné de manuscrits éthiopiens'' (Paris, 1859) is a description of 234 Ethiopian [[manuscript]]s collected by Antoine.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; He also compiled various vocabularies, including a ''Dictionnaire de [[Amharic language|la langue amariñña]]'' (Paris, 1881), and prepared an edition of the ''[[Shepherd of Hermas]]'', with the Latin version, in 1860. He published numerous papers dealing with the geography of Ethiopia, Ethiopian coins and ancient inscriptions. Under the title of ''Reconnaissances magnétiques'' he published in 1890 an account of the [[magnetic]] observations made by him in the course of several journeys to the [[Red Sea]] and the [[Levant]]. The general account of the travels of the two brothers was published by Arnaud in 1868 under the title of ''Douze ans dans la Haute Ethiopie''.&lt;ref name=eb11&gt;{{harvnb|Keltie|1910|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antoine was responsible for streamlining techniques towards [[geodesy]], along with inventing a new [[theodolite]] for measuring angles.&lt;ref name=ww/&gt;

==Abbadie, a Basque and bascophile==

Basque through his father, Abbadie developed a particular interest about the [[Basque Language]] after meeting the Prince [[Louis Lucien Bonaparte]] in London. He started his academic work on Basque in 1852.

A speaker of both [[Souletin]] and [[Lapurdian]], a resident of [[Lapurdi]], Abbadie considered himself a [[Basque people|Basque]] from [[Soule]].

The popularity of the [[motto]] [[Zazpiak Bat]] is attributed to Abbadie.

==The castle or château==
[[Image:Chateau d Abbadie.jpg|thumb|400px|Domaine d'Abbadia in [[Hendaye]], designed by [[Viollet-le-Duc]]]]
Abbadie gave his castle home the name ''Abbadia'', which is the name still used in Basque. However in French it is usually referred to as ''[[Château d'Abbadie|Chateau d'Abbadie]]'' or ''Domaine d'Abbadia'', and locally it is not unusual for it to be called ''le Chateau d'Antoine d'Abbadie''.

The château was built between 1864 and 1879 on a cliff by the Atlantic Ocean, and was designed by [[Viollet Le Duc]] in the [[Neo Gothic]] style, and is considered one of the most important examples of French Gothic Revival Architecture.&lt;ref name=Delpech&gt;{{harvnb|Delpech|2014|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is divided in three parts : the observatory and library, the chapel, and the living quarters.

Nowadays the château still belongs to the [[Académie des sciences|Academy of Science]] to which it was bequeathed in 1895 on condition of its producing a catalogue of half-a-million [[star]]s within fifty years' time.&lt;ref name=ce/&gt;

The château was classified as a protected historical monument by France in 1984. Most of the château property now belongs to the [[Conservatoire du littoral|Coastal Protection Agency]], and is managed by the city of Hendaye.
