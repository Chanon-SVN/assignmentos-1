'''''Batman''''' is a 1989 American [[superhero film]] directed by [[Tim Burton]] and produced by [[Jon Peters]], based on the [[DC Comics]] [[Batman|character of the same name]]. It is the first installment of [[Warner Bros.]]' [[Burton/Schumacher Batman film series|initial ''Batman'' film series]]. The film stars [[Jack Nicholson]], [[Michael Keaton]] in the title role, [[Kim Basinger]], [[Robert Wuhl]], [[Pat Hingle]], [[Billy Dee Williams]], [[Michael Gough]], and [[Jack Palance]]. In the film, Batman deals with the rise of a costumed criminal known as &quot;[[Joker (comics)|The Joker]]&quot;.

After Burton was hired as director in 1986, [[Steve Englehart]] and [[Julie Hickson]] wrote [[film treatment]]s before [[Sam Hamm]] wrote the first screenplay. ''Batman'' was not [[greenlight|greenlit]] until after the success of Burton's ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988). Numerous [[A-list]] actors were considered for the role of Batman  before Keaton was cast. Keaton's casting caused a controversy since, by 1988, he had become [[typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as a comedic actor and many observers doubted he could portray a serious role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elfman&quot; /&gt; Nicholson accepted the role of the Joker under strict conditions that dictated a high salary, a portion of the [[box office]] profits and his shooting schedule. The tone and themes of the film were influenced in part by [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke|The Killing Joke]]'' and [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]''. Filming took place at [[Pinewood Studios]] from October 1988 to January 1989. The budget escalated from [[United States dollar|$]]30 million to $48 million, while the [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike]] forced Hamm to drop out. Uncredited rewrites were performed by [[Warren Skaaren]], [[Charles McKeown]] and [[Jonathan Gems]].

''Batman'' was a critical and financial success, earning over $400 million in box office totals. It was the fifth-highest grossing film in history at the time of its release. The film received several [[Saturn Award]] nominations and a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] nomination, and won an [[Academy Award]]. It also inspired the equally successful ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', paving the way for the [[DC animated universe]], and has influenced [[Hollywood]]'s modern marketing and development techniques of the [[superhero film]] genre.

==Plot==
The mayor of [[Gotham City]] orders District Attorney [[Harvey Dent]] ([[Billy Dee Williams]]) and Police Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] ([[Pat Hingle]]) to increase police activity and combat crime in preparation for the city's bicentennial. Reporter Alexander Knox ([[Robert Wuhl]]) and photojournalist [[Vicki Vale]] ([[Kim Basinger]]) begin to investigate reports of a vigilante nicknamed &quot;[[Batman]]&quot;, who is targeting the city's criminals.

Mob boss Carl Grissom ([[Jack Palance]]), who has already been targeted by Dent, discovers his mistress ([[Jerry Hall]]) is involved with his second-in-command, Jack Napier ([[Jack Nicholson]]). With the help of corrupt policeman Max Eckhardt ([[William Hootkins]]), Grissom sets up Napier to be murdered during a raid at the [[Ace Chemicals|Axis Chemicals]] plant. During the ensuing shootout, Napier kills Eckhardt, after which Batman suddenly appears. The two struggle, and Napier is accidentally knocked into a vat of chemical waste. Batman flees, and Napier is thought to be dead.

Batman is, in actuality, [[Bruce Wayne]] ([[Michael Keaton]]), a billionaire industrialist who, as a child, witnessed his parents' murder at the hands of a young psychopathic mugger. Bruce meets and falls for Vicki at a fundraiser, and the two begin a relationship. Meanwhile, Napier survives the accident, but is horribly disfigured with chalk-white skin, emerald-green hair and a permanent ruby-red grin. Driven insane by his reflection, he reinvents himself as &quot;[[Joker (comics)|the Joker]]&quot;, kills Grissom in revenge for his set-up, and usurps his criminal empire.

The Joker begins to spread terror in the city, first by lacing hygiene products with a deadly chemical known as &quot;''[[Joker venom|Smilex]]''&quot;, which causes victims to [[death from laughter|laugh to death]] when used in certain combinations. The Joker then sets a trap at the Gotham Museum of Art for Vicki, and he and his henchmen [[Vandalism|vandalize the surrounding works of art]]. Batman arrives and rescues Vicki, and the pair escape in the [[Batmobile]]. Batman gives information about Smilex to Vicki so she can warn the city via Gotham newspapers about the poisoned products.

Bruce meets with Vicki at her apartment, prepared to tell her that he is Batman. They are interrupted by the Joker, who asks Bruce, &quot;''Have you ever danced with the devil by the pale moonlight?''&quot; before shooting him. Bruce, who was wearing body armor, escapes, and recollects that the young mugger who killed his parents said the same statement; he realizes that the mugger was none other than the Joker himself. Vicki suddenly appears in the [[Batcave]], having been let in by Bruce's butler, [[Alfred Pennyworth]] ([[Michael Gough]]). After avouching himself to Vicki, Bruce—as Batman—leaves to destroy the Axis Chemical plant. Meanwhile, the Joker lures the townspeople to a nighttime parade with a promise to give away $20 million in cash. When the citizens arrive, however, he attacks them with Smilex gas spewing it from his giant parade balloons. Batman arrives on the scene and saves Gotham City from the attack using the [[Batplane|Batwing]], but the Joker kidnaps Vicki and takes her to the top of a cathedral.

Batman pursues the two, and at the top of the dusty edifice, he and the Joker confront each other in single combat. When the Joker attempts an escape via a helicopter, Batman grapples the Joker's leg to a heavy stone sculpture, causing him to fall to his death. Commissioner Gordon unveils the [[Bat-Signal]] along with a note from Batman read by Harvey Dent, promising to defend Gotham whenever crime strikes again.

==Themes==
[[Image:MikeandJack.jpg|thumb|225px|&quot;The duel of the freaks&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Elfman&quot; /&gt;]]
When discussing the central [[theme (arts)|theme]] of ''Batman'', director Tim Burton explained, &quot;the whole film and mythology of the character is a complete duel of the freaks. It's a fight between two disturbed people&quot;, adding that &quot;The Joker is such a great character because there's a complete freedom to him. Any character who operates on the outside of society and is deemed a freak and an outcast then has the freedom to do what they want... They are the darker sides of freedom. Insanity is in some scary way the most freedom you can have, because you're not bound by the laws of society&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elfman&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Mark Salisbury |author2=[[Tim Burton]]  | title =Burton on Burton | publisher =Faber and Faber | year =2006 | location = London | pages =70–83 | isbn = 0-571-22926-3 | chapter = Batman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burton saw Bruce Wayne as the bearer of a double identity, exposing one while hiding the reality from the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elfman&quot; /&gt; Burton biographer Ken Hanke wrote that Bruce Wayne, struggling with his alter-ego as Batman, is depicted as an [[antihero]]. Hanke felt that Batman has to push the boundaries of civil justice to deal with certain criminals, such as the Joker.&lt;ref name=&quot;forever&quot; /&gt; [[Kim Newman]] theorized that &quot;Burton and the writers saw Batman and the Joker as a dramatic antithesis, and the film deals with their intertwined origins and fates to an even greater extent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Kim Newman]] | title = Batman | work = [[Monthly Film Bulletin]] | pages=61–64 | date = September 1989 | accessdate = 2008-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Motif (visual arts)|visual motif]] is present in the scene of Batman's first major act of vigilantism at Axis Chemicals, wherein he is carefully framed so that the single word AXIS, in gigantic red neon letters, looms over him, comparing his acts to those of the [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] governments of [[World War II]] and thus implying that the dangers of these actions include the transformation of Jack Napier into the Joker.&lt;ref name=&quot;forever&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author= Ken Hanke | title =Tim Burton: An Unauthorized Biography of the Filmmaker | publisher =[[Renaissance Books]] | year =1999 | location = | pages =75–85 | isbn = 1-58063-162-2 | chapter = Going Batty in Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Batman'' also conveys trademarks found in 1930s [[pulp magazine]]s, notably the design of Gotham City stylized with [[Art Deco]] design.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hal&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = Hal Hinson | work = [[The Washington Post]] | date = 1989-06-23 | title = Batman | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/batmanpg13hinson_a07fb8.htm | accessdate = 2008-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Corliss]], writing for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', observed that Gotham's design was a reference to films such as ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927) and ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1920). &quot;Gotham City, despite being shot on a studio [[backlot]]&quot;, he continued, &quot;is literally another character in the script. It has the demeaning presence of [[German Expressionism]] and [[fascist architecture]], staring down at the citizens.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Richard Corliss]] | title = Murk in The Myth | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957972,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = 1989-06-19 | accessdate = 2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanke further addressed the notions of ''Batman'' being a [[period piece]], in that &quot;The citizens, cops, people and the [[black-and-white]] television looks like it takes place in 1939&quot;; but later said: &quot;Had the filmmakers made [[Vicki Vale]] a [[femme fatale]] rather than a [[damsel in distress]], this could have made ''Batman'' as a homage and tribute to classic [[film noir]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Manor&quot; /&gt; Portions of the [[climax (narrative)|climax]] pay homage to ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;cartoon&quot; /&gt;

===Development===
{{quote box|align=left|width=35%|quote=&quot;I was never a giant comic book fan, but I've always loved the image of Batman and the Joker. The reason I've never been a comic book fan — and I think it started when I was a child — is because I could never tell which box I was supposed to read. I don't know if it was [[dyslexia]] or whatever, but that's why I loved ''The Killing Joke'', because for the first time I could tell which one to read. It's my favorite. It's the first comic I've ever loved. And the success of those graphic novels made our ideas more acceptable.&quot;|source=—Tim Burton&lt;ref&gt;Tim Burton, ''Burton on Burton: Revised Edition'' (London: Faber and Faber, 2006) 71.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the late 1970s, Batman's popularity was waning.&lt;ref name=CBS/&gt; [[CBS]] was interested in producing a ''Batman in Outer Space'' film. Producers [[Michael Uslan]] and [[Benjamin Melniker]] purchased the [[film rights]] of Batman from [[DC Comics]] on October 3, 1979. It was Uslan's wish &quot;to make the definitive, dark, serious version of Batman, the way [[Bob Kane]] and [[Bill Finger]] had envisioned him in 1939. A creature of the night; stalking criminals in the shadows.&quot;&lt;ref name=CBS&gt;{{cite news|author = Bill &quot;Jett&quot; Ramey|url = http://www.batman-on-film.com/interview_muslan_2.html|title = An Interview With Michael Uslan – Part 1|work = Batman-on-Film|date = November 8, 2005|accessdate =May 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Maibaum]] was approached to write a script with [[Guy Hamilton]] to direct, but the two turned down the offer. Uslan was unsuccessful with [[pitch (filmmaking)|pitching]] ''Batman'' to various movie studios because they wanted the film to be similar to the [[camp (style)|campy]] [[Batman (TV series)|1960s TV series]]. [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[United Artists]] were among those to turn down the film.&lt;ref name=Columbia&gt;{{cite news|author = Bill &quot;Jett&quot; Ramey|url = http://www.batman-on-film.com/interview_muslan_3.html|title = An Interview With Michael Uslan – Part 2|work = Batman-on-Film|date = November 11, 2005|accessdate =May 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A disappointed Uslan then wrote a script titled ''Return of the Batman'' to give the film industry a better idea of his vision for the film. Uslan later compared its dark tone to that of ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns|The Dark Knight Returns]]'', which his script pre-dated by six years.&lt;ref name=CBS/&gt; In November 1979, producers [[Jon Peters]] and [[Peter Guber]] joined the project.&lt;ref name=Guber&gt;{{cite book|author = Nancy Griffin; Kim Masters|title = Hit &amp; Run: How Jon Peters and Peter Guber Took Sony For A Ride In Hollywood|publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|year =1997|pages =158–174|isbn = 0-684-80931-1|chapter = Hit Men}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four producers felt it was best to pattern the film's development after that of ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978).&lt;ref name=production&gt;{{cite news|author = Alan Jones|url=http://www.batman-online.com/index.php?articles;id=2|title = ''Batman'' in Production|publisher = [[Cinefantastique]]|pages=75–88|date = November 1989|accessdate =May 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uslan, Melniker and Guber pitched ''Batman'' to [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]], but the studio turned it down.&lt;ref name=road&gt;[[Michael Uslan]], [[Benjamin Melniker]], [[Peter Guber]], [[Tom Mankiewicz]], [[Sam Hamm]], ''Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight—The Road to Gotham City'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt; Though no movie studios were yet involved, the project was publicly announced with a budget of $15 million in July 1980 at the [[Comic Art Convention]] in New York. [[Warner Bros.]] decided to accept ''Batman''.&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite news|author = Alan Jones|url=http://www.1989batman.com/2013/08/vintage-magazine-article.html|title = Batman|work = [[Cinefantastique]]|pages=55–67|date = November 1989|accessdate =May 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom Mankiewicz]] completed a script titled ''The Batman'' in June 1983, focusing on Batman and [[Dick Grayson]]'s origins, with the Joker and [[Rupert Thorne]] as villains, and [[Silver St. Cloud]] as the romantic interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Stax|title = The Stax Report Special Edition: Script Review of ''The Batman''|work = [[IGN]]|date = December 1, 2001|url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/036/036038p1.html|accessdate =October 24, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081206080334/http://movies.ign.com/articles/036/036038p1.html| archivedate= December 6, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mankiewicz took inspiration from the [[limited series]] ''Batman: Strange Apparitions'' (ISBN 1-56389-500-5), written by [[Steve Englehart]].&lt;ref name=White&gt;{{cite news|author = Taylor L. White|title = Batman|work = [[Cinefantastique]]|pages=33–40|date = July 1989|accessdate =May 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comic book artist [[Marshall Rogers]], who worked with Englehart on ''Strange Apparitions'', was hired for [[concept art]].&lt;ref name=road/&gt; ''The Batman'' was then announced in late 1983 for a mid-1985 release date on a budget of $20 million. Originally, Mankiewicz had wanted an unknown actor for Batman, [[William Holden]] for [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]], [[David Niven]] as [[Alfred Pennyworth]] and [[Peter O'Toole]] as [[Penguin (comics)|the Penguin]] who Mankiewicz wanted to portray as a mobster with low body temperature.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt; Holden died in 1981 and Niven in 1983, so this would never come to pass. A number of filmmakers were attached to Mankiewicz' script, including [[Ivan Reitman]] and [[Joe Dante]]. Reitman wanted to cast [[Bill Murray]] as Batman and [[Eddie Murphy]] as Robin.&lt;ref name=Elfman&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Salisbury|author2=[[Tim Burton]] |title =Burton on Burton|publisher =Faber and Faber|year =2006|location = London|pages =70–83|isbn = 0-571-22926-3|chapter = Batman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nine rewrites were performed by nine separate writers. Most of them were based on ''Strange Apparitions''. However it was Mankiewicz's script that was still being used to guide the project.&lt;ref name=forever&gt;{{cite book|author= Ken Hanke|title =Tim Burton: An Unauthorized Biography of the Filmmaker|publisher =[[Renaissance Books]]|year =1999|pages =75–85|id = 1-58063-162-2|chapter = Going Batty in Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the financial success of ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]'' (1985), Warner Bros. hired Tim Burton to direct ''Batman''. Burton had then-girlfriend [[Julie Hickson]] write a new 30-page [[film treatment]], feeling the previous script by Mankiewicz was [[camp (style)|campy]]. The success of ''[[Batman: The Dark Knight Returns|The Dark Knight Returns]]'' and ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke|The Killing Joke]]'' rekindled Warner Bros.' interest in a film adaptation. Burton was initially not a comic book fan, but he was impressed by the dark and serious tone found in both ''The Dark Knight Returns'' and ''The Killing Joke''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elfman&quot; /&gt; Warner Bros. enlisted the aid of [[Steve Englehart]] to write a new treatment in March 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steve&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Batman | work = [[Steve Englehart]].com | url = http://www.steveenglehart.com/Film/Batman%20movie.html | accessdate = 2007-11-25| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071214111803/http://www.steveenglehart.com/Film/Batman%20movie.html| archivedate= 14 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It included the Joker and [[Rupert Thorne]] as the main villains, with a [[cameo appearance]] by the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]. [[Silver St. Cloud]] and [[Dick Grayson]] were key supporting roles. It followed the similar storyline from Englehart's own ''Strange Apparitions'' (ISBN 1-56389-500-5). Warner Bros. was impressed, but Englehart felt there were too many characters. He removed the Penguin and Dick Grayson in his second treatment, finishing in May 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steve&quot; /&gt;

Burton approached Sam Hamm, a comic book fan, to write the screenplay.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = Alan Jones | title = Batman | work = [[Cinefantastique]] | pages=55–67 | date = November 1989 | accessdate = 2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamm decided not to use an [[origin story]], feeling that flashbacks would be more suitable and that &quot;unlocking the mystery&quot; would become part of the storyline.&lt;ref name=&quot;White&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = Taylor L. White | title = Batman | work = [[Cinefantastique]] | pages=33–40 | date = July 1989 | accessdate = 2008-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reasoned, &quot;You totally destroy your credibility if you show the literal process by which Bruce Wayne becomes Batman.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamm&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = Stephen Rebello | title = Sam Hamm - Screenwriter | work = [[Cinefantastique]] | pages=34–41 | date = November 1989 | accessdate = 2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamm replaced Silver St. Cloud with Vicki Vale and Rupert Thorne with his own creation, Carl Grissom. He completed his script in October 1986, which demoted Dick Grayson to a cameo rather than a supporting character.&lt;ref name=&quot;storm&quot; /&gt; One scene in Hamm's script had a young James Gordon on duty the night of the murder of Bruce Wayne's parents. When Hamm's script was rewritten, the scene was deleted but retaken to ''[[Batman Begins]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;heroes&quot; /&gt;

Warner Bros. was less willing to move forward on development, despite their enthusiasm for Hamm's script, which Batman co-creator [[Bob Kane]] greeted with positive feedback.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elfman&quot; /&gt; Hamm's script was then [[Bootleg (comics)|bootleg]]ged at various comic book stores in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;White&quot; /&gt; ''Batman'' was finally given the [[Green-light|greenlight]] to commence pre-production in April 1988, after the success of Burton's ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' (1988).&lt;ref name=&quot;Elfman&quot; /&gt; When comic book fans found out about Burton directing the film with Michael Keaton starring in the lead role, controversy arose over the tone and direction ''Batman'' was going in.&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowry|first=Brian|title=Batman Backlash: Ben Affleck Has Nothing on Michael Keaton|url=http://variety.com/2013/voices/columns/batman-backlash-ben-affleck-has-nothing-on-michael-keaton-1200587317/|work=Variety|accessdate=24 August 2013|date=August 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hamm explained, &quot;they hear Tim Burton's name and they think of ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]''. They hear Keaton's name and they think of any number of Michael Keaton comedies. You think of the 1960s version of ''Batman'', and it was the complete opposite of our film. We tried to market it with a typical dark and serious tone, but the fans didn't believe us.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;White&quot; /&gt; To combat negative reports on the film's production, Kane was hired as creative consultant.&lt;ref name=&quot;production&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = Alan Jones | title = ''Batman'' in Production | work = [[Cinefantastique]] | pages=75–88 | date = November 1989 | accessdate = 2008-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
Parallel to the ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' casting, a who's who of Hollywood top stars were considered for the role of Batman, with the likes of [[Mel Gibson]], [[Kevin Costner]], [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Tom Selleck]] and [[Bill Murray]] being considered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guber&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Nancy Griffin; Kim Masters | title = Hit &amp; Run: How Jon Peters and Peter Guber Took Sony For A Ride In Hollywood | publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | year =1997| location = | pages =158–174 | isbn = 0-684-80931-1 | chapter = Hit Men}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierce Brosnan]] was approached for the role, stating: &quot;I went and met with Tim Burton for the role of Batman.

===Filming===
[[File:Knebworth W front.JPG|thumb|right|300px|[[Knebworth House]] served as the [[Wayne Manor]].]]
The filmmakers considered filming ''Batman'' entirely on the Warner Bros. [[backlot]] in [[Burbank, California]], but media interest in the film made them change the location. It was shot at [[Pinewood Studios]] in [[England]] from October 1988 to January 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joe&quot; /&gt; 18 [[sound stage]]s were used, almost the entirety of Pinewood's 95-acre backlot.&lt;ref name=&quot;production&quot; /&gt; Locations included [[Knebworth House]] and [[Hatfield House]] doubling for [[Wayne Manor]], plus [[Acton Lane Power Station]] and [[Little Barford Power Station]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Manor&quot;&gt;Hanke, p.87-96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukonscreen.com/gkjhkbb-Batman-(1989).html |title=Batman (1989) Filming Locations |publisher=Ukonscreen.com |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original production budget escalated from $30 million to $48 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guber&quot; /&gt; Filming was highly secretive. The unit [[publicist]] was offered and refused [[pound sterling|£]]10,000 for the first pictures of Jack Nicholson as the Joker. The police were later called in when two reels of footage (about 20 minutes' worth) were stolen.&lt;ref name=&quot;empire&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = Iain Johnstone | title = Dark Knight in the City of Dreams | work = [[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] | pages=46–54 | date =August 1989 | accessdate = 2008-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; With various problems during filming, Burton called it &quot;torture. The worst period of my life!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guber&quot; /&gt;

Hamm was not allowed to perform rewrites during the [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot; /&gt; [[Jonathan Gems]], [[Warren Skaaren]] and [[Charles McKeown]] rewrote the script during filming.&lt;ref&gt;Salisbury, Burton, p.145&lt;/ref&gt; Hamm criticized the rewrites, but blamed the changes on Warner Bros.&lt;ref name=&quot;White&quot; /&gt; Burton explained, &quot;I don't understand why that became such a problem. We started out with a script that everyone liked, although we recognized it needed a little work.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Elfman&quot; /&gt; Dick Grayson appeared in the shooting script but was deleted, as the filmmakers felt he was irrelevant to the plot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot; /&gt; Bob Kane supported this decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;audio&quot; /&gt;

Originally in the climax, the Joker was to kill Vicki Vale, sending Batman into a vengeful fury. Jon Peters reworked the climax without telling Burton and commissioned production designer Anton Furst to create a {{convert|38|ft|m|sing=on}} model of the cathedral.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone&quot; /&gt; This cost $100,000 when the film was already well over budget. Burton disliked the idea, having no clue how the scene would end: &quot;Here were Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger walking up this cathedral, and halfway up Jack turns around and says, 'Why am I walking up all these stairs? Where am I going?' 'We'll talk about it when you get to the top!' I had to tell him that I didn't know.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = Tom Stone | title = How Hollywood had the last laugh | work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 2004-09-28 | accessdate = 2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
{{Quote box|width=40%|align=right|quote=&quot;I envisaged Gotham the way I see it now at Pinewood. They've got it, every building, every trash can, every brick.&quot;|source=—''Batman'' co-creator Bob Kane when looking at the buildings at Pinewood Studios&lt;ref name=empire/&gt;}}
Burton was impressed with [[Anton Furst]]'s designs in ''[[The Company of Wolves]]'', and previously failed to hire Furst as production designer for ''Beetlejuice''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joe&quot; /&gt; Furst had been too committed on ''[[High Spirits (film)|High Spirits]]'', a choice he later regretted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot; /&gt; Furst enjoyed working with Burton. &quot;I don't think I've ever felt so naturally in tune with a director&quot;, he said; &quot;Conceptually, spiritually, visually, or artistically. There was never any problem because we never fought over anything. Texture, attitude and feelings are what Burton is a master at.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;production&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Keaton as Batman.jpg|175px|thumb|left|The Batsuit, worn by Michael Keaton.]]
Furst and the [[art department]] deliberately mixed clashing architectural styles to &quot;make Gotham City the ugliest and bleakest [[metropolis]] imaginable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anton Furst]], [[Derek Meddings]], ''Visualizing Gotham: The Production Design of Batman'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt; Furst continued, &quot;we imagined what New York City might have become without a planning commission. A city run by crime, with a riot of architectural styles. An essay in ugliness. As if hell erupted through the pavement and kept on going&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Richard Corliss]]; Elaine Dutka | title = The Caped Crusader Flies Again | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,957980,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = 1989-06-19 | accessdate = 2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1985 film ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' by [[Terry Gilliam]] was also a notable influence upon the film's production design, as both Burton and Furst studied it as a reference.&lt;ref name=&quot;production&quot; /&gt; [[Derek Meddings]] served as the [[visual effects supervisor]], while [[Keith Short]] helped construct the newly created [[Batmobile#Batman and Batman Returns|1989 Batmobile]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Batman | work = [[Keith Short]].com | url = http://www.keithshortsculptor.com/batman4.htm | accessdate = 2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; adding two [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning machine gun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith Short]], ''Building the Batmobile'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt; On designing the Batmobile, Furst explained, &quot;We looked at jet aircraft components, we looked at war machines, we looked at all sorts of things. In the end, we went into pure expressionism, taking the [[Bonneville Salt Flats|Salt Flat Racers]] of the 30s and the [[Chevrolet Corvette (C2)|Sting Ray macho machines]] of the 50s&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;empire&quot; /&gt; The car was built upon a [[Chevrolet Impala]] when previous development with a [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] and [[Ford Mustang]] failed.&lt;ref name=&quot;empire&quot; /&gt;

[[Costume design]]er [[Bob Ringwood]] turned down the chance to work on ''[[Licence to Kill]]'' in favor of ''Batman''. Ringwood found it difficult designing the [[Batsuit]] because &quot;the image of Batman in the comics is this huge, big six-foot-four hunk with a dimpled chin. Michael Keaton is a guy with average build&quot;, he stated. &quot;The problem was to make somebody who was average-sized and ordinary-looking into this bigger-than-life creature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;batto&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = Jody Duncan Shannon | title = Building the Bat-suit | work = [[Cinefex]] | pages=16–24 | date = February 1990 | accessdate = 2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burton commented, &quot;Michael is a bit [[claustrophobia|claustrophobic]], which made it worse for him. The costume put him in a dark, Batman-like mood though, so he was able to use it to his advantage&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;batto&quot; /&gt; Burton's idea was to use an all-black suit, and was met with positive feedback by Bob Kane. Jon Peters wanted to use a [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] [[product placement]] with the Batsuit.&lt;ref&gt;Bob Ringwood, [[Tim Burton]], ''Designing the Batsuit'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ringwood studied over 200 comic book issues for inspiration. 28 sculpted latex designs were created; 25 different cape looks and 6 different heads were made, accumulating a total cost of $250,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blogs.amctv.com/future_of_classic/2007/06/reinventing-the.html | title = Reinventing the Batsuit for the Modern Era | work = [[AMC (TV network)|American Movies Classic]] | accessdate = 2008-10-17| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081006231931/http://blogs.amctv.com/future_of_classic/2007/06/reinventing-the.html| archivedate= 6 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comic book fans initially expressed negative feedback against the Batsuit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joe&quot; /&gt; Burton opted not to use tights, spandex, or underpants as seen in the comic book, feeling it was not intimidating.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elfman&quot; /&gt; [[Prosthetic makeup]] designer Nick Dudman used acrylic-based makeup paint called PAX for Nicholson's chalk-white face.

===Music===
{{See also|Batman (album)|Batman (score)}}
Burton hired [[Danny Elfman]], his collaborator on ''Pee-wee's Big Adventure'' and ''Beetlejuice'', to compose the music score. For inspiration, Elfman was given ''The Dark Knight Returns''. Elfman was worried, as he had never worked on a production this large in budget and scale.&lt;ref name=&quot;overtures&quot;&gt;[[Danny Elfman]], [[Tim Burton]], ''Nocturnal Overtures: The Music of Batman'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, producer Jon Peters was skeptical of hiring Elfman, but was later convinced when he heard the opening number.&lt;ref name=&quot;reborn&quot; /&gt; Peters and Peter Guber wanted [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] to write music for the Joker and [[Michael Jackson]] to do the romance songs. Elfman would then combine the style of Prince and Jackson's songs together for the entire film score.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elfman&quot; /&gt;

Burton protested the ideas, citing &quot;my movies aren't commercial like ''[[Top Gun]]''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Elfman&quot; /&gt; Elfman enlisted the help of [[Oingo Boingo]] lead guitarist [[Steve Bartek]] and [[Shirley Walker]] to arrange the compositions for the orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=The Elfman Cometh | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]| date=1990-02-23| url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,316794,00.html| accessdate=2007-12-18 | first=Ron | last=Givens| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080107120918/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,316794,00.html| archivedate= 7 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elfman was later displeased with the [[Audio mixing (film and television)|audio mixing]] of his film score. &quot;''Batman'' was done in England by technicians who didn't care, and the non-caring showed,&quot; he stated. &quot;I'm not putting down England because they've done gorgeous [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubs]] there, but this particular crew elected not to.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Judy Sloane | title = Elfman on scoring | work = Film Review | page=77 | date = August 1995 | accessdate = 2008-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Batman'' was one of the first films to spawn two soundtracks. One of them featured songs written by Prince while the other showcased Elfman's score. Both were successful,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Stephen Holden]] | title = The Pop Life | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1989-07-19 | accessdate = 2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and compilations of Elfman's [[opening credits]] were used in the [[title sequence]] theme for ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', also composed by Shirley Walker.&lt;ref name=&quot;reboot&quot; /&gt;

==Marketing==
Production designer Anton Furst designed the poster, which he called &quot;evocative but ubiquitous. Only featuring the Bat-Symbol. Not too much and not too little&quot;. Earlier designs &quot;had the word 'Batman' spelled in ''[[RoboCop]]'' or ''[[Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)|Conan the Barbarian]]''-type font&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guber&quot; /&gt; Jon Peters unified all the film's [[tie-in]]s, even turning down $6 million from [[General Motors]] to build the [[Batmobile]] because the car company would not relinquish creative control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guber&quot; /&gt;

During production, Peters read in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' that comic book fans were unsatisfied with the casting of Michael Keaton. In response, Peters rushed the first [[film trailer]] that played in thousands of theaters during Christmas. It was simply an assemblage of scenes without music, but happened to create enormous anticipation for the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guber&quot; /&gt; [[DC Comics]] allowed screenwriter Sam Hamm to write his own [[limited series|comic book miniseries]]. Hamm's stories were collected in the [[graphic novel]] ''Batman: Blind Justice'' (ISBN 978-1563890475). [[Denys Cowan]] and [[Dick Giordano]] illustrated the artwork.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamm&quot; /&gt; ''Blind Justice'' tells the story of Bruce Wayne trying to solve a series of murders connected to [[Wayne Enterprises]]. It also marks the first appearance of [[Henri Ducard]], who was later used in the [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]ed ''[[Batman Begins]]'', albeit as an alias for the more notable [[Ra's al Ghul]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamm&quot; /&gt;

In the months pre-dating ''Batman''{{'}}s release in June 1989, a [[popular culture]] phenomenon rose known as &quot;Batmania&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joe&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author = Joe Morgenstern | title = Tim Burton, Batman and The Joker | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1989-04-09 | accessdate = 2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over $750 million worth of merchandise was sold.&lt;ref name=&quot;reboot&quot; /&gt; [[Cult film]]maker and comic book writer [[Kevin Smith]] remembered: &quot;That summer was huge. You couldn't turn around without seeing the Bat-Signal somewhere. People were cutting it into their fucking heads.

David Handelman of ''[[The New York Observer]]'' categorized ''Batman'' as a [[high concept]] film. He believed &quot;it is less movie than a corporate [[behemoth]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cartoon&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Alison McMahan | title =The Films of Tim Burton: Animating Live Action in Contemporary Hollywood | publisher = [[Gale (Cengage)|Gale]] | year =2005 | location = [[Farmington Hills, Michigan]] | pages = 121–156 | isbn = 0-8264-1566-0 | chapter = Burton's Batman: Myth, Marketing, and Merchandising }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reaction===
''Batman'' was criticized in some quarters for being too dark and too violent, but nonetheless received positive reviews.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elfman&quot; /&gt; Many observed that Burton was more interested in the Joker and the art and set production design than Batman or anything else in terms of characterization and screentime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elfman&quot; /&gt; Comic book fans reacted negatively over the Joker murdering [[Thomas Wayne|Thomas]] and [[Martha Wayne]]; in the comic book, [[Joe Chill]] is responsible. Writer Sam Hamm said it was Burton's idea to have the Joker murder Wayne's parents. &quot;The Writer's Strike was going on,&quot; Hamm said, &quot;and Tim had the other writers do that. I also hold innocent to Alfred letting Vicki Vale into the [[Batcave]]. Fans were ticked off with that, and I agree. That would have been Alfred's last day of employment at [[Wayne Manor]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;reborn&quot;&gt;[[Tim Burton]], [[Sam Hamm]], [[Danny Elfman]], ''Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight&amp;mdash;The Legend Reborn'', 2005, [[Warner Home Video]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The songs written by Prince were criticized for being &quot;too out of place&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones&quot; /&gt; While Burton has stated he had no problem with the Prince songs, he was less enthusiastic with their use in the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;forever&quot; /&gt; On the film, Burton remarked, &quot;I liked parts of it, but the whole movie is mainly boring to me. It's OK, but it was more of a cultural phenomenon than a great movie.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mad&quot; /&gt; Nonetheless, it received acclaim. Based on 67 reviews collected by [[Rotten Tomatoes]], 72% of reviewers reacted positively to ''Batman''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1001781-batman/ | title = Batman | work = [[Rotten Tomatoes]] | accessdate = 2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] gives an aggregated score of 66, based on 17 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.metacritic.com/movie/batman | title = Batman (1989): Reviews | work = [[Metacritic]] | accessdate = 2008-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comics fans reacted negatively to the casting of Keaton as Batman, though they were appeased upon watching the film and seeing his performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;cartoon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sauriol, Patrick (July 1998). &quot;Dark Knight Triumphant&quot;.

However, he concluded, &quot;the best thing that can be said about ''Batman'' is that it led to ''[[Batman Returns]]'', which was a far superior effort.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[James Berardinelli]] | url = http://www.reelviews.net/movies/b/batman.html | title = Batman (1989) | work = [http://www.reelviews.net/ ReelViews] | date = 2001-06-05 | accessdate = 2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' felt &quot;Jack Nicholson stole every scene&quot; but still greeted the film with positive feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117788899.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 | title = Batman | date = 1989-01-01 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = 2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] was highly impressed with the production design, but claimed &quot;''Batman'' is a triumph of design over story, style over substance, a great-looking movie with a plot you can't care much about.&quot; He also called the film &quot;a depressing experience&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19890623/REVIEWS/906230301/1023 | title = Batman | publisher = [[Roger Ebert]] | accessdate = 2008-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; His reviewing partner [[Gene Siskel]] disagreed, describing the film as having a 'refreshingly adult' approach with performances, direction and set design that 'draws you into a psychological world'. [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' called it &quot;watchable enough&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] | url = http://onfilm.chicagoreader.com/movies/capsules/769_BATMAN_AAA_burton | title = Batman | work = [[Chicago Reader]] |date = 1989-06-23 | accessdate = 2008-05-05| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080506120937/http://onfilm.chicagoreader.com/movies/capsules/769_BATMAN_AAA_burton| archivedate= 6 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of ''Batman'' prompted [[Warner Bros. Animation]] to create the acclaimed ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', as a result beginning the long-running [[DC animated universe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = [[Paul Dini]]; [[Chip Kidd]]| title =[[Batman Animated]] | publisher = [[Titan Books]] | year = 1998 | page = 2 | isbn = 1-84023-016-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and helped establish the modern day [[superhero film]] genre. Series co-creator [[Bruce Timm]] stated the television show's [[Art Deco]] design was inspired from the film. Timm commented, &quot;our show would never have gotten made if it hadn't been for that first ''Batman'' movie.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = [[Bruce Timm]]; Erick Nolen-Weathington| title =Modern Masters Volume 3: Bruce Timm | publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]] | year = 2004 | pages = 38–49 | isbn = 1-893905-30-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Batman'' initiated the [[Batman in film#Tim Burton / Joel Schumahcer series|original ''Batman'' film series]]. Burton joked, &quot;ever since I did ''Batman'', it was like the first dark comic book movie. Now everyone wants to do a dark and serious superhero movie. I guess I'm the one responsible for that trend.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Geoff Boucher | title = Tim Burton talks about Johnny Depp, 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'The Dark Knight' | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = 2008-10-15 | accessdate = 2008-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producers [[Michael Uslan]] and [[Benjamin Melniker]] filed a [[breach of contract]] lawsuit in [[Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors|Los Angeles County Superior Court]] on March 26, 1992. Uslan and Melniker claimed to be &quot;the victims of a sinister campaign of fraud and coercion that has cheated them out of continuing involvement in the production of ''Batman'' and its sequels. We were denied proper credits, and deprived of any financial rewards for our indispensable creative contribution to the success of ''Batman''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guber&quot; /&gt; A [[superior court]] judge rejected the lawsuit. Total revenues of ''Batman'' have topped $2 billion, with Uslan claiming to have &quot;not seen a penny more than that since our [[net profit]] participation has proved worthless.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guber&quot; /&gt; Warner Bros. offered the pair an out-of-court pay-off, a sum described by Uslan and Melniker's attorney as &quot;two popcorns and two [[Coca-Cola|Coke]]s&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Olly Richards (September 1992). &quot;Trouble in Gotham&quot;, ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'', pp. 21-23. Retrieved on 2008-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting on the twentieth anniversary of its release in a retrospective article on [[Salon.com]], film commentator Scott Mendelson noted the continuing impact that ''Batman'' has had on the motion film industry, including the increasing importance of opening weekend box office receipts; the narrowing window between a film's debut and its video release that caused the demise of second-run movie theaters; the accelerated acquisition of pre-existing, pre-sold properties for film adaptations that can be readily leveraged for merchandizing tie-ins; the primacy of the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG-13]] as the target rating for film producers; and more off-beat, non-traditional casting opportunities for genre films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Scott Mendelson | title=20 years later, how Batman changed the movie business... | url=http://open.salon.com/blog/scott_mendelson/2009/06/24/20_years_later_how_batman_changed_the_movie_business | work= | publisher=Salon.com | date=June 24, 2009 &lt;!-- @ 10:38 am  --&gt; | accessdate=2009-07-04| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090627032037/http://open.salon.com/blog/scott_mendelson/2009/06/24/20_years_later_how_batman_changed_the_movie_business| archivedate= 27 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film also received recognition from the [[American Film Institute]]. Batman was anointed the 46th greatest movie hero on AFI's ''[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains|100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/handv100.pdf?docID=246&lt;/ref&gt; The Joker was anointed the 45th greatest movie villain on the same list. In 2008, ''Batman'' was selected by [[Empire (film magazine)|''Empire'' magazine]] as number 458 of ''The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/500/8.asp |title=Empire Features |publisher=Empireonline.com |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home video===
Many versions of the film have been released. Included are [[VHS]], [[Laserdisc]], single-disc [[DVD]], special edition DVD and an anthology set. The ''Batman: The Motion Picture Anthology'' released in 2005 included 2-disc special edition DVDs of the Tim Burton/[[Joel Schumacher]] ''Batman'' films. This anthology set was re-released on [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] on March 10, 2009.

On May 19, 2009 a 20th anniversary stand-alone edition was released. This stand-alone version contains exactly the same special features as its anthology set (both DVD and Blu-ray) counterparts. There are two differences: This version includes a 50-page booklet guide to the film, and a slight variation in packaging from normal Blu-ray cases (i.e. a Warner Bros. [[digital book|digibook]]). They both include a digital copy of the film.

The film was also included in ''The Tim Burton Collection'' DVD/Blu-ray set in 2012, alongside its sequel, ''[[Batman Returns]]'', and several other Burton films.
