'''Brian Wilson Kernighan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɜr|n|ɨ|h|æ|n}}; born January 1, 1942)&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT 2002&quot;/&gt; is a Canadian [[computer scientist]] who worked at [[Bell Labs]] alongside [[Unix]] creators [[Ken Thompson]] and [[Dennis Ritchie]] and contributed to the development of [[Unix]]. He is also coauthor of the [[AWK]] and [[AMPL]] [[programming language]]s. The &quot;K&quot; of [[The C Programming Language|K&amp;R C]] and the &quot;K&quot; in AWK both stand for &quot;Kernighan&quot;. Since 2000 Brian Kernighan has been a Professor at the Computer Science Department of [[Princeton University]], where he is also the Undergraduate Department Representative.

Kernighan's name became widely known through co-authorship of the first book on the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] with [[Dennis Ritchie]]. Kernighan affirmed that he had no part in the design of the C language (&quot;it's entirely Dennis Ritchie's work&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;LJ 2003&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview with Brian Kernighan |url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/7035 |publisher =[[Linux Journal]] |first=Aleksey |last=Dolya |date=29 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He authored many [[Unix]] programs, including [[troff|ditroff]], and [[cron]] for [[Version 7 Unix]].

In collaboration with Shen Lin he devised well-known [[heuristic]]s for two [[NP-complete]] optimization problems: [[graph partition]]ing and the [[travelling salesman problem]]. (In a display of authorial equity, the former is usually called the ''[[Kernighan–Lin algorithm]]'', while the latter is styled ''[[Lin–Kernighan heuristic|Lin–Kernighan]]''.)

Kernighan was the software editor for [[Prentice Hall|Prentice Hall International]]. His &quot;Software Tools&quot; series spread the essence of &quot;C/Unix thinking&quot; with makeovers for [[BASIC]], [[Fortran|FORTRAN]], and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], and most notably his &quot;[[Ratfor]]&quot; (rational FORTRAN) was put in the public domain.

He has said that if stranded on an island with only one programming language it would have to be C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~mihaib/kernighan-interview/index.html |title=An Interview with Brian Kernighan |first=Mihai |last=Budiu |date=July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kernighan coined the term [[Unix]] in the 1970s. The original term he coined was Unics (for Uniplexed Information and Computing Service, a play on [[Multics]]), which was later changed to Unix.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Kernighan is also known as a coiner of the expression &quot;What You See Is All You Get&quot; (WYSIAYG), which is a sarcastic variant of the original &quot;What You See Is What You Get&quot; ([[WYSIWYG]]).{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}  Kernighan's term is used to indicate that WYSIWYG systems might throw away information in a document that could be useful in other contexts.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Brian Kernighan in 2012 at Bell Labs 3.jpg|thumb|Brian Kernighan speaks at a tribute to [[Dennis Ritchie]] in 2012 at [[Bell Labs]].]]
Born in [[Toronto]], Kernighan attended the [[University of Toronto]] between 1960 and 1964, earning his [[Bachelor's degree]] in [[engineering physics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LJ 2003&quot; /&gt; He received his PhD in [[electrical engineering]] from [[Princeton University]], where he has held a professorship in the department of computer science since 2000.  Each fall he teaches a course called &quot;Computers in Our World&quot;, which introduces the fundamentals of computing to non-majors.

==Summary of achievements==
* The AMPL programming language
* The AWK programming language, with [[Alfred Aho]] and [[Peter J. Weinberger]], and its book ''The AWK Programming Language''
* ditroff, or &quot;device independent [[troff]]&quot;, which allowed troff to be used with any device
* [[The Elements of Programming Style]], with [[P. J. Plauger]]
* The first documented [[&quot;Hello, world!&quot; program]], in Kernighan's [http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/btut.html &quot;A Tutorial Introduction to the Language B&quot;] (1972)
* Ratfor
* ''Software Tools'', a book and set of tools for Ratfor, co-created in part with P. J. Plauger
* ''Software Tools in Pascal'', a book and set of tools for [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], with P. J. Plauger
* ''The C Programming Language'', with C creator [[Dennis Ritchie]], the first book on C
* The [[eqn]] typesetting language for troff, with [[Lorinda Cherry]]
* The [[m4 (computer language)|m4]] macro processing language, with Dennis Ritchie
* The [[pic language|pic]] typesetting language for troff
* [[The Practice of Programming]], with [[Rob Pike]]
* [[The Unix Programming Environment]], a tutorial book, with Rob Pike
* [http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/bwk-on-pascal.html &quot;Why Pascal is Not My Favorite Programming Language&quot;], a popular criticism of [[Niklaus Wirth]]'s [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]]. Some parts of the criticism are obsolete due to ISO 7185 (Programming Languages - Pascal); the criticism was written before ISO 7185 was created. (AT&amp;T Computing Science Technical Report #100)

==Writings ==

* ''The C Programming Language'' (1978, 1988) with Dennis M. Ritchie
* ''Software Tools in Pascal'' (1981) with P.&amp;nbsp;J. Plauger
* ''[[The Unix Programming Environment]]'' (1984) with Rob Pike
* ''The AWK Programming Language'' (1988) with Alfred Aho and Peter J. Weinberger
* ''[[The Practice of Programming]]'' (1999) with Rob Pike
* ''AMPL: A Modeling Language for Mathematical Programming, 2nd ed.'' (2003) with [[Robert Fourer]] and David Gay
* ''D is for Digital: What a well-informed person should know about computers and communications'' (2011)
