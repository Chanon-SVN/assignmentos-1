The '''AK-47''' is a [[selective fire|selective-fire]], [[gas operated|gas-operated]] [[7.62×39mm]] [[assault rifle]], first developed in the [[Soviet Union]] by [[Mikhail Kalashnikov]]. It is officially known in the Soviet documentation as ''Avtomat Kalashnikova'' ({{lang-ru|'''А'''втомат '''К'''алашникова}}). It is also known as '''Kalashnikov''', '''AK''', or in Russian slang, '''Kalash'''.

Design work on the AK-47 began in the last year of World War II (1945). After the war in 1946, the AK-47 was presented for official military trials. In 1948, the fixed-stock version was introduced into active service with selected units of the [[Soviet Army]]. An early development of the design was the '''AKS''' (S—''Skladnoy'' or &quot;folding&quot;), which was equipped with an underfolding metal [[stock (firearms)|shoulder stock]]. In 1949, the AK-47 was officially accepted by the [[Soviet Armed Forces]]{{sfnm|Monetchikov|2005|1p=67|Bolotin|1995|2p=129}} and used by the majority of the member states of the [[Warsaw Pact]].

Even after six decades the model and its variants remain the most popular and widely used assault rifles in the world because of their substantial reliability even under harsh conditions, low production costs compared to contemporary Western weapons, availability in virtually every geographic region and ease of use. The AK-47 has been manufactured in many countries and has seen service with armed forces as well as [[irregular military|irregular forces]] worldwide, and was the basis for developing many other types of individual and crew-served firearms. More AK-type rifles have been produced than all other assault rifles combined.{{sfn|Killicoat|2007|p=3}}

==History==

===Pre-history===

During World War II, the Germans introduced the [[StG 44]] (''Sturmgewehr,'' literally &quot;assault rifle&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Rottman (2011). The AK-47: Kalashnikov-series assault rifles. Osprey Publishing. p. 9. ISBN 978-1-84908-835-0.&lt;/ref&gt; in large numbers—about half a million were built. This gun, from which the English terminology &quot;assault rifle&quot; originates, was chambered in a new [[intermediate cartridge]], the [[7.92×33mm Kurz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lonesentry.com/articles/ttt07/stg44-assault-rifle.html &quot;Machine Carbine Promoted&quot;] Tactical and Technical Trends, No. 57, April 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets captured an early prototype of the StG 44, a [[Mkb 42(H)]], and they were also given samples of the U.S. [[M1 Carbine]], which was also developed for a less powerful round. Based on these developments, on 15 July 1943, the [[People's Commissariat of Arms of the USSR|People's Commissariat for Armaments]] decided to introduce a Soviet intermediate cartridge. A team led by N.M. Elizarov (Н.М. Елизаров) was charged with the development of what eventually became the [[7.62×39mm]] M43; the new cartridge went into mass production in March 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monetchikov 2005 24–25&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Monetchikov|first=Sergei|script-title=ru:История русского автомата|trans_title=The History of Russian Assault Rifle|year=2005|pages=24–25|publisher=[[Military Historical Museum of Artillery, Engineers and Signal Corps]]|location=St. Petersburg|isbn=5-98655-006-4|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chivers2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=C. J. Chivers|title=The Gun|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=r3VwUEHoDikC&amp;pg=PA166|year=2010|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-9653-3|pages=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same meeting that adopted the new cartridge, the Soviet planners decided that a whole range of new small arms should use it, including a semi-automatic carbine, a fully automatic rifle, and a light machine gun. Design contests for these new weapons began in earnest in 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monetchikov 2005 24–25&quot;/&gt;

===Development and competition===
[[Mikhail Kalashnikov]] began his career as a weapon designer while in a hospital after he was shot in the shoulder during the [[Battle of Bryansk]].&lt;ref name=foxnews/&gt;{{sfn|Bolotin|1995|pp=123–124}} After tinkering with a submachine gun design in 1942{{sfn|Bolotin|1995|p=123}} and with a light machine gun in 1943,{{sfn|Monetchikov|2005|p=38}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Naumovich Bolotin; [translation: Igor F.

Naftul'eff ; edited by John Walter, Heikki Pohjolainen]|title=Soviet Small-arms and Ammunition|year=1995|publisher=Finnish Arms Museum Foundation (Suomen asemuseosäätiö)|location=Hyvinkää|isbn=9519718419|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fully automatic weapon category, the specifications (тактико-технические требования - TTT) number 2456-43&lt;ref name=&quot;K2010_3&quot;&gt;Руслан Чумак, [http://www.kalashnikov.ru/upload/medialibrary/4dd/014_020.pdf Казалось бы мелочи] ''КАЛАШНИКОВ. ОРУЖИЕ, БОЕПРИПАСЫ, СНАРЯЖЕНИЕ'' 2010/3, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; passed down by the [[GRAU|GAU]] in November 1943 were rather ambitious: the weapon was to have a 500–520&amp;nbsp;mm long barrel and had to weigh no more than 5&amp;nbsp;kg, including a folding [[bipod]]. Despite this, many Soviet designers participated in this category, Tokarev, Korovin, Degtyarev, Shpagin, Simonov, and Prilutsky are some of the more prominent names who submitted designs;{{sfn|Monetchikov|2005|p=26}} Kalashnikov did not submit an entry for this contest.&lt;ref name=&quot;K2010_3&quot;/&gt; A gun presented by [[Aleksei Sudaev|Sudayev]], the AS-44 (weight: 5.6&amp;nbsp;kg, barrel length 505&amp;nbsp;mm), came up ahead in the mid-1944 trials.

However subsequent field trials conducted in 1945 found it to be too heavy for the average soldier and Sudayev was asked to lighten his gun; his lightened variant (5.35&amp;nbsp;kg, 485&amp;nbsp;mm barrel) turned out to be less reliable and less accurate. In October 1945, the GAU was convinced to dispense with the built-in bipod requirement; Sudayev's gun in this variant, called OAS (облегченный автомат Судаева - ОАС), weighed only 4.8&amp;nbsp;kg. Sudayev however fell ill and died in 1946, preventing further development.&lt;ref&gt;Сергей МОНЕТЧИКОВ, [http://www.bratishka.ru/archiv/2002/9/2002_9_8.php РУССКИЕ ОРУЖЕЙНИКИ: Жизнь, оборвавшаяся на взлете] БРАТИШКА, October 2002 issue&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bolotin|1995|pp=127}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monetchikov|first=Sergei|script-title=ru:История русского автомата|trans_title=The History of Russian Assault Rifle|year=2005|page=35|publisher=[[Military Historical Museum of Artillery, Engineers and Signal Corps]]|location=St. Petersburg|isbn=5-98655-006-4|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experience gained from the reliability issues of the lightened Sudayev design convinced the GAU that a brand new competition had to be held, and for this round the requirements were explicitly stated: a wholesale replacement of the PPSh-41 and [[PPS-43]] sub-machine guns was what they were after. The new competition was initiated in 1946 under GAU TTT number 3131-45. Ten designs had been submitted by August 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monetchikov|first=Sergei|script-title=ru:История русского автомата|trans_title=The History of Russian Assault Rifle|year=2005|page=36|publisher=[[Military Historical Museum of Artillery, Engineers and Signal Corps]]|location=St. Petersburg|isbn=5-98655-006-4|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalashnikov and his design team from factory number two in [[Kovrov]] submitted an entry. It was a gas-operated rifle which had a breech-block mechanism similar to his 1944 carbine, and a curved 30-round magazine. Kalashnikov's rifles (codenamed AK-1 and −2, the former with a milled [[receiver (firearms)|receiver]] and the latter with a stamped one) proved to be reliable and the weapon was accepted to second round of competition along with designs by A. A. Dementyev (KB-P-520) and A. A. Bulkin (TKB-415). In late 1946, as the rifles were being tested, one of Kalashnikov's assistants, Aleksandr Zaitsev, suggested a major redesign of AK-1, particularly to improve reliability. At first, Kalashnikov was reluctant, given that their rifle had already fared better than its competitors. Eventually, however, Zaitsev managed to persuade Kalashnikov. The new rifle (factory name KB-P-580) proved to be simple and reliable under a wide range of conditions with convenient handling characteristics; prototypes with serial numbers one to three were completed in November 1947. Production of the first army trial series began in early 1948 at the [[Izhevsk]] factory number 524,{{sfn|Monetchikov|2005|p=64}} and in 1949 it was adopted by the Soviet Army as &quot;7.62&amp;nbsp;mm Kalashnikov assault rifle (AK)&quot;.{{sfnm|Monetchikov|2005|1p=67|Bolotin|1995|2p=129}}

Kalashnikov borrowed the long stroke piston design from the [[M1 Garand]], with the op rod and piston mounted on the top instead of the bottom of the rifle.&lt;ref name=&quot;The AR-15 2010&quot;&gt;''The Gun Digest Book of The AR-15, Volume 3'', By Patrick Sweeney, Gun Digest Books, 11 Aug 2010, 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalashnikov's team had access to all of these weapons and had no need to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot;,&lt;ref name=Wasserman/&gt; though he denied that his design was based on the German [[Sturmgewehr 44]] assault rifle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.powercustom.com/AKPages/MikhailKalashnikov.htm |title=Mikhail Kalashnikov |author=Val Shilin |author2=Charlie Cutshaw |publisher=Power Custom |accessdate=19 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kalashnikov himself observed: &quot;A lot of Russian Army soldiers ask me how one can become a constructor, and how new weaponry is designed. These are very difficult questions. Each designer seems to have his own paths, his own successes and failures. But one thing is clear: before attempting to create something new, it is vital to have a good appreciation of everything that already exists in this field. I myself have had many experiences confirming this to be so.&quot;{{sfn|Bolotin|1995|pp=123–124}}

There are claims about Kalashnikov copying other designs, like Bulkin's TKB-415&lt;ref name=Popenker/&gt; or Simonov's AVS-31.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kuptsov |first=Andrei |script-title=ru:Странная история оружия: С.

===Receiver development===
[[File:AKMS and AK-47 DD-ST-85-01270.jpg|thumb|AKMS with a Type 4B receiver (top), and an AK-47 with a Type 2A]]

There were many difficulties during the initial phase of production. The first production models had stamped sheet metal [[receiver (firearms)|receivers]]. Difficulties were encountered in welding the guide and ejector rails, causing high rejection rates.{{sfn|Poyer|2006|pp=8–11}} Instead of halting production, a heavy machined receiver was substituted for the sheet metal receiver. This was a more costly process, but the use of machined receivers accelerated production as tooling and labor for the earlier [[Mosin–Nagant]] rifle's machined receiver were easily adapted. Partly because of these problems, the Soviets were not able to distribute large numbers of the new rifle to soldiers until 1956. During this time, production of the interim [[SKS]] rifle continued.{{sfn|Poyer|2006|pp=8–11}}

Once manufacturing difficulties had been overcome, a redesigned version designated the [[AKM]] (M for &quot;modernized&quot; or &quot;upgraded&quot;; in Russian: ''Автомат Калашникова Модернизированный [Avtomat Kalashnikova Modernizirovanniy])'' was introduced in 1959.{{sfn|Ezell|1986|p=36}} This new model used a stamped sheet metal receiver and featured a slanted [[muzzle brake]] on the end of the [[gun barrel|barrel]] to compensate for [[muzzle rise]] under recoil. In addition, a hammer retarder was added to prevent the weapon from firing out of battery (without the bolt being fully closed), during rapid or automatic fire.{{sfn|Poyer|2006|pp=8–11}} This is also sometimes referred to as a &quot;cyclic rate reducer&quot;, or simply &quot;rate reducer&quot;, as it also has the effect of reducing the number of rounds fired per minute during automatic fire. It was also roughly one-third lighter than the previous model.{{sfn|Ezell|1986|p=36}}

Both licensed and unlicensed production of the Kalashnikov weapons abroad were almost exclusively of the AKM variant, partially due to the much easier production of the stamped receiver. This model is the most commonly encountered, having been produced in much greater quantities. All rifles based on the Kalashnikov design are frequently referred to as AK-47s in the West, although this is only correct when applied to rifles based on the original three receiver types.{{sfn|Poyer|2006|p=2}} In most former Eastern Bloc countries, the weapon is known simply as the &quot;Kalashnikov&quot; or &quot;AK&quot;. The photo above at right illustrates the differences between the Type 2 milled receiver and the Type 4 stamped, including the use of rivets rather than welds on the stamped receiver, as well as the placement of a small dimple above the magazine well for stabilization of the magazine.

In 1974, the Soviets began replacing their AK-47 and AKM rifles with a newer design, the [[AK-74]], which uses [[5.45×39mm]] ammunition. This new rifle and cartridge had only started to be manufactured in Eastern European nations when the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union collapsed]], drastically slowing production of the AK-74 and other weapons of the former Soviet bloc.

==Features==
The AK-47 was designed to be a simple, reliable automatic rifle that could be manufactured quickly and cheaply, using mass production methods that were state of the art in the Soviet Union during the late 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategypage.com/dls/articles/20030423.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070325171640/http://www.strategypage.com/dls/articles/20030423.asp |archivedate=25 March 2007 |title=An AK for Every Market by James Dunnigan April 23, 2003 |publisher=strategypage.com |accessdate=26 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large gas piston, generous clearances between moving parts, and tapered cartridge case design allow the gun to endure large amounts of foreign matter and fouling without failing to cycle. This reliability comes at the expense of accuracy, as the looser tolerances do not allow for precision and consistency.

===Operating cycle===
[[File:Viet Cong soldier DD-ST-99-04298.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vietcong]] guerrilla stands beneath a Vietcong flag carrying his AK-47 rifle. Note: fire selector, bolt handle and magazine lever.]]
[[File:Chinese type 56 AK47.jpg|thumb|The gas-operated mechanism of a [[Type 56 assault rifle|Chinese AK-47]]]]

The AK-47 uses a long stroke gas system, as was found in the [[M1 Garand]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The AR-15 2010&quot;/&gt; To fire, the operator inserts a loaded [[Magazine (firearm)|magazine]], pulls back and releases the charging handle, and then pulls the [[Trigger (firearms)|trigger]]. In semi-automatic, the firearm fires only once, requiring the trigger to be released and depressed again for the next shot. In full-automatic, the rifle continues to fire automatically cycling fresh rounds into the chamber, until the magazine is exhausted or pressure is released from the trigger. As each bullet travels through the barrel, a portion of the gases expanding behind it is diverted into the gas tube above the barrel, where it acts on the [[Gas-operated reloading#Long-stroke piston|gas piston]]. The piston, in turn, is driven backward, pushing the [[Bolt (firearm)|bolt]] carrier, which causes the bolt to move backwards, ejecting the spent round, and chambering a new round when the recoil spring pushes it forward.&lt;ref name=&quot;army&quot;&gt;Department of the Army. [[wikisource:en:AK-47 Operator's Manual]]. 203d Military Intelligence Battalion.&lt;/ref&gt;

This long-stroke piston design used by the AK-47 (and notably in the designs of the M1 Garand and [[IMI Tavor]])&lt;ref&gt;''Future Weapons'', by Kevin Dockery, (Penguin 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; is generally associated with greater reliability in adverse conditions.&lt;ref&gt;''The Battle Rifle: Development and Use Since World War II'', By Russell C. Tilstra, (McFarland 2014) page 25-28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fire selector===
The prototype of the AK-47, had a separate fire selector and safety.&lt;ref name=Popenker-Williams&gt;{{cite book |last=Popenker |first=Maxim |last2=Williams |first2=Anthony G |title=Assault Rifle |year=2005 |publisher=Crowood Press |url=http://books.google.com/?id=TNwgAAAACAAJ |isbn=978-1-86126-700-9}}{{Page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were later combined in the production version to simplify the design. The fire selector is a large lever located on the right side of the rifle, it acts as a dust-cover and prevents the charging handle from being pulled fully to the rear when it is on safe.&lt;ref name=&quot;arsenalinc1&quot;&gt;Peter G. Kokalis, [http://www.arsenalinc.com/usa/imgs/articles/BulgarianAK.pdf Kalashnikovs – 3 of the best]. arsenalinc.com&lt;/ref&gt; It is operated by the shooter's right fore-fingers and it has 3 settings: safe (up), full-auto (center), and semi-auto (down).&lt;ref name=&quot;arsenalinc1&quot;/&gt; The reason for this is, under stress a soldier will push the selector lever down with considerable force bypassing the full-auto stage and setting the rifle to semi-auto.&lt;ref name=&quot;arsenalinc1&quot;/&gt; To set the AK-47 to full-auto requires the deliberate action of centering the selector lever.&lt;ref name=&quot;arsenalinc1&quot;/&gt;
Some AK-type rifles also have a small vertical selector lever on the left side of the receiver just above the pistol grip.&lt;ref name=&quot;arsenalinc1&quot;/&gt; This lever is operated by the shooter's right thumb and has three settings: safe (forward), full-auto (center), and semi-auto (backward).&lt;ref name=&quot;arsenalinc1&quot;/&gt;

The standard magazine capacity is 30 rounds. There are also 10, 20 and 40-round box magazines, as well as 75-round [[drum magazine|drum]] magazines.

The AK-47's 30-round magazines have a pronounced curve that allows them to smoothly feed ammunition into the chamber. Their heavy steel construction combined with &quot;feed-lips&quot; (the surfaces at the top of the magazine that control the angle at which the cartridge enters the chamber) machined from a single steel billet makes them highly resistant to damage. These magazines are so strong that &quot;Soldiers have been known to use their mags as hammers, and even bottle openers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=419|title=Identifying &amp; Collecting the 7.62×39 AK-47/AKM Magazine|work=Small Arms Defense Journal|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCh0GkBmo2o|title=Ak Mag bottle opener|work=YouTube|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the AK-47 magazine more reliable, although heavier than U.S. and NATO magazines.

Most Yugoslavian and some East German AK magazines were made with cartridge followers that hold the bolt open when empty; however, most AK magazine followers allow the bolt to close when the magazine is empty.

===Sights===
[[File:AK47-rear-sight.jpg|thumb|right|Rear sight of a Chinese Type 56&lt;br&gt;Note: {{convert|100|to|800|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} settings]]

The AK-47 uses a notched rear tangent [[iron sight]] is calibrated in {{convert|100|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} increments from {{convert|100|to|800|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;scribd1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/35165946/Ak-47-Technical-Manual|title=Ak 47 Technical Manual|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The front sight is a post adjustable for elevation in the field. Horizontal adjustment is done by the armory before issue. The [[Point-blank range|&quot;point-blank range&quot;]] battle zero setting &quot;'''П'''&quot; on the 7.62×39mm AKM rear tangent sight element corresponds to a {{convert|300|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} zero.&lt;ref name=&quot;scribd1&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Rottman|2011|p=42}} These settings mirror the [[Mosin–Nagant]] and [[SKS]] rifles which the AK-47 replaced. Soldiers are instructed to fire at any target within this range by simply placing the sights on the center of mass (the belt buckle) of the enemy target. Any errors in range estimation are tactically irrelevant, as a well-aimed shot will hit the torso of the enemy soldier. Some AK-type rifles have a front sight with a flip-up luminous dot that is calibrated at {{convert|50|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}, for improved night fighting.&lt;ref name=&quot;scribd1&quot;/&gt; 

====Side rail====
All current AKs (100 series) and some older models, have side rails for mounting a variety of scopes and sighting devices, such as the [[PSO-1|PSO-1 Optical Sniper Sight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=7.62 mm Kalashnikov assault rifles AK103, АК104 |publisher=[[Izhmash]] |url=http://www.izhmash.ru/eng/product/ak103.shtml |accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The side rails, allow for removal and remounting of optical accessories without interfering with the zeroing of the optic. However, the 100 series side folding stocks cannot be folded with the optics mounted.&lt;ref&gt;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_6_49/ai_100727296/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accessories===
[[File:AK-47 bayonet and scabbard.jpg|thumb|left|AK-47 6H3 bayonet and scabbard]]

Accessories supplied with the rifle include a {{convert|387|mm|in|abbr=on}} long 6H3 [[bayonet]] featuring a {{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=on}} long spear point blade. The AK-47 bayonet is installed by slipping the {{convert|17.7|mm|in|abbr=on}} diameter muzzle ring around the muzzle and latching the handle down on the bayonet lug under the front sight base.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldbayonets.com&quot;&gt;http://worldbayonets.com/Misc__Pages/ak_bayonets/ak_bayonets.html | Kalashnikov Bayonets © Ralph E.

[[File:AK103 GP 34.jpg|thumb|AK-103 with [[GP-25|GP-34]] Grenade Launcher]]

All current model AK-47 rifles can mount under-barrel 40&amp;nbsp;mm grenade launchers such as the [[GP-25|BG-15, GP-25, GP-30 &amp; GP-34]], which can fire up to 20 rounds per minute and have an effective range of up to 400 metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=40 mm underbarrel grenade launcher GP-34 |publisher=[[Izhmash]] |url=http://www.izhmash.ru/eng/product/gp-34.shtml |accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main grenade is the VOG-25 (VOG-25M) fragmentation grenade which has a 6&amp;nbsp;m (9&amp;nbsp;m) (20&amp;nbsp;ft (30&amp;nbsp;ft)) lethality radius. The VOG-25P/VOG-25PM (&quot;jumping&quot;) variant explodes {{convert|0.5|–|1|m|ft}} above the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Russian Close Combat Weapon |pages=482–489 |year=2010 |publisher=Association &quot;Defense Enterprises Assistance League&quot; |location=Moscow |isbn=978-5-904540-04-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AK-47 can also mount a (rarely used) [[Kalashnikov grenade launcher|cup-type grenade launcher]] that fires standard [[RGD-5]] Soviet hand-grenades.&lt;ref name=&quot;ar15&quot;&gt;http://www.ar15.com/content/manuals/AK47USArmyOperatorManual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The maximum effective range is approximately 150 meters.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ar15.com/content/webPDF/AK47USArmyOperatorManual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This cup-type launcher can also be used to launch [[tear-gas]] and [[riot control]] grenades.

===Terminal ballistics===
{{Main|7.62×39mm}}
[[File:RussianWP.jpg|thumb|300px|Wound Profiles of Russian small-arms ammunition compiled by Dr. [[Martin Fackler]] on behalf of the U.S. military.]]
The AK fires the 7.62×39mm [[cartridge (weaponry)|cartridge]] with a muzzle velocity of {{convert|715|m/s|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;izhmash.ru&quot;/&gt; The cartridge weight is {{convert|16.3|g|oz|abbr=on|1}}, the projectile weight is {{convert|7.9|g|gr|abbr=on|0}}.&lt;ref name=ammoweight&gt;{{cite book|title=Land Forces Weapons: Export Catalogue |year=2003 |page=85 |publisher=[[Rosoboronexport]] |location=Moscow |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/30301368/Rosoboronexport-Land-Forces-Weapons-Catalogue |oclc=61406322}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AK has excellent penetration when shooting through heavy foliage, walls or a common vehicle's metal body and into an opponent attempting to use these things as cover. The 7.62x39mm M43 projectile does not generally fragment when striking an opponent and has an unusual tendency to remain intact even after making contact with bone.

Most, if not all, of the 7.62x39mm ammunition found today is of the upgraded M67 variety. This variety deleted the steel insert, shifting the center of gravity rearward, and allowing the projectile to destabilize (or yaw) at about {{convert|3.3|in|cm|abbr=on}}, nearly {{convert|6.7|in|cm|abbr=on}} earlier in tissue than the M43 round.&lt;ref name=&quot;uthr.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uthr.org/SpecialReports/Military_rifle_bullet_wound_patterns.htm|title=Military rifle bullet wound patterns|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change also reduces penetration in ballistic gelatin to ~{{convert|25|in|cm|abbr=on}} for the newer M67 round versus ~{{convert|29|in|cm|abbr=on}} for the older M43 round.&lt;ref name=&quot;uthr.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frfrogspad.com/terminal2.htm |title= Military rifle bullet wound patterns comparison charts |first= Martin L. |last=Fackler |publisher=Frfrogspad.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the wounding potential of M67 is mostly limited to the small permanent wound channel the bullet itself makes, especially when the bullet yaws.&lt;ref name=&quot;uthr.org&quot;/&gt;

===Service life===
The AK-47 and its variants are made in dozens of countries, with &quot;quality ranging from finely engineered weapons to pieces of questionable workmanship.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;The AK-47: Kalashnikov-series assault rifles. By Gordon Rottman. Osprey Publishing. Copyright 2011. Page 39&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the AK-47 has a service/system life of approximately 6,000,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ak-47.us/pic/books/emak90.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to 10,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forgottenweapons.com/rifles/wz-88-tantal/|title=wz.88 Tantal|work=Forgotten Weapons|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 15,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arsenal-bg.com/defense_police/7,62ar-m1-m1f.htm|title=Arsenal 7.62mm &quot;Arsenal&quot; Assault Rifle AR-M1 and with Folding Butt AR-M1F|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; rounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;armedforcesmuseum.com&quot;&gt;http://armedforcesmuseum.com/ak-47-assault-rifle/&lt;/ref&gt; The AK-47 was designed to be a cheap, simple, easy to manufacture assault rifle,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/the-worlds-most-popular-gun&lt;/ref&gt; perfectly matching Soviet military doctrine that treats equipment and weapons as disposable items.&lt;ref name=&quot;scribd.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/50751945/Soviet-Weapon-System-Acquisition|title=Soviet Weapon-System Acquisition|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As units are often deployed without adequate logistical support and dependent on &quot;battlefield cannibalization&quot; for resupply, it is actually more cost-effective to replace rather than repair weapons.&lt;ref name=&quot;scribd.com&quot;/&gt;

The AK-47 has small parts and springs that need to be replaced every few thousand rounds. However...&quot;Every time it is disassembled beyond the field stripping stage, it will take some time for some parts to regain their fit, some parts may tend to shake loose and fall out when firing the weapon. Some parts of the AK-47 line are riveted together. Repairing these can be quite a hassle, since the end of the rivet has to be ground off and a new one set after the part is replaced.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;scribd1&quot;/&gt;

Certainly more have been produced elsewhere; but the above list represents known producers and is limited to only military variants. An updated AK-47 design – the [[AK-103]] – is still produced in Russia.

===Derivatives===

The basic design of the AK-47 has been used as the basis for other successful rifle designs such as the Finnish [[Rk 62|Rk 62/76]] and [[Rk 95 Tp]], the Israeli [[IMI Galil|Galil]], the Indian [[INSAS rifle|INSAS]] and the Yugoslav [[Zastava M76]] and M77/82 rifles. Several [[bullpup]] designs have surfaced such as the Chinese [[Norinco Type 86S]], although none have been produced in quantity. Bullpup conversions are also available commercially.

==Illicit trade==
[[File:Cambodian AK-47.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cambodia]]n AK-47 with black furniture]]
Throughout the world, the AK and its variants are among the most commonly smuggled small arms sold to governments, rebels, criminals, and civilians alike, with little international oversight.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} In some countries, prices for AKs are very low; in Somalia, Rwanda, Mozambique, Congo and Tanzania prices are between $30 and $125 per weapon,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxfam.de/files/20060623_theak47_200kb.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and prices have fallen in the last few decades due to mass counterfeiting.

The [[Taliban]] and the [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|Northern Alliance]] fought each other with Soviet AKs; some of these were exported to Pakistan. The gun is now also made in Pakistan's semi-autonomous areas (see [[Khyber Pass Copy]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defstrat.com/exec/frmArticleDetails.aspx?DID=347&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;'The Distribution of Iranian Ammunition in Africa', by the private British arms-tracking group Conflict Armament Research (CAR), shows how [[Iran]] broke trade embargos{{sic|?}} and infiltrated African markets with massive amounts of illegal, unmarked 7.62&amp;nbsp;mm rounds for the Kalashnikov-style AK-47 rifles.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Ingersoll, &quot;[http://www.businessinsider.com/iran-sells-ammo-to-africa-2013-1 Investigation Reveals Iran's Secret Role In African Conflicts]&quot;, [[Business Insider]], 14 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimated numbers of AK-type weapons vary. The Small Arms Survey suggest that &quot;between 70 and 100&amp;nbsp;million of these weapons have been produced since 1947.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/A-Yearbook/2004/en/Small-Arms-Survey-2004-Chapter-01-EN.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank estimates that out of the 500&amp;nbsp;million total firearms available worldwide, 100&amp;nbsp;million are of the Kalashnikov family, and 75&amp;nbsp;million are AK-47s.{{sfn|Killicoat|2007|p=3}} Because AK-type weapons have been made in other countries, often illicitly, it is impossible to know how many really exist.&lt;ref&gt;Graves-Brown, P. 2007 [http://mcu.sagepub.com/content/12/3/285.abstract?rss=1 &quot;Avtomat Kalashnikova&quot;].

Russia/Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, as well as Western countries (especially the United States) supplied arms and technical knowledge to numerous countries and rebel forces in a global struggle between the [[Warsaw Pact]] nations and their allies against [[NATO]] and their allies called the [[Cold War]]. While the NATO countries used rifles such as the relatively expensive [[M14 rifle|M14]], [[FN FAL]], [[Heckler &amp; Koch G3|HK G3]] and [[M16 rifle|M16]] assault rifle during this time, the low production and materials costs of the AK-47 meant that the Russia/USSR could produce and supply its allies at a very low cost. Because of its low cost, it was also duplicated or used as the basis for many other rifles (see [[List of weapons influenced by the Kalashnikov design]]), such as the Israeli [[IMI Galil|Galil]], Chinese [[Type 56 assault rifle|Type 56]], and Swiss [[SIG SG 550]]. As a result, the Cold War saw the mass export of AK-47s by the Soviet Union and the PRC to their allies, such as the Nicaraguan [[Sandinistas]], [[Viet Cong]] as well as Middle Eastern, Asian, and African revolutionaries. The United States also purchased the Type 56 from the PRC to give to the [[mujahideen]] guerrillas during the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.5rar.asn.au/weapons/type_56.htm|title=Chinese Type-56 Assault Rifle|publisher=|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proliferation of this weapon is reflected by more than just numbers. The AK-47 is included in the [[flag of Mozambique]] and its [[Emblem of Mozambique|emblem]], an acknowledgment that the country's leaders gained power in large part through the effective use of their AK-47s.&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Gordon (1997-03-13). [http://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/13/world/burst-of-pride-for-a-staccato-executioner-ak-47.html &quot;Burst of Pride for a Staccato Executioner: AK-47&quot;]. ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also found in the coats of arms of [[Coat of arms of East Timor|East Timor]], the revolution era [[coat of arms of Burkina Faso]] and the [[flag of Hezbollah]].

[[File:MP Inspects Captured AK-47 Vietnam.jpg|thumb|left|A [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[Military police|M.P.]] inspects a Soviet AK-47 recovered in Vietnam, 1968.]]
[[File:Mortar attack on Shigal Tarna garrison, Kunar Province, 87.jpg|thumb|right|During the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]] in the 1980s, several sources simultaneously arming both sides of the Afghan conflict, the country was filled with AK-47s and their derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/how-did-the-ak47-become-the-most-abundant-weapon-on-earth-2124407.html&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In parts of the Western world, the AK-47 is associated with their enemies; both Cold War era and present-day. In the pro-communist states, the AK-47 became a symbol of third-world revolution. During the 1980s, the Soviet Union became the principal arms dealer to countries embargoed by Western nations, including Middle Eastern nations such as Syria, Libya and Iran, who welcomed Soviet Union backing against Israel. After the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|fall of the Soviet Union]], AK-47s were sold both openly and on the black market to any group with cash, including drug cartels and dictatorial states, and more recently they have been seen in the hands of Islamic groups such as the [[Taliban]] and [[Al-Qaeda]] in Afghanistan and Iraq, and [[FARC]], [[Ejército de Liberación Nacional]] guerrillas in Colombia. Western movies often portray criminals, gang members and terrorists using AK-47s. For these reasons, in the U.S. and Western Europe the AK-47 is stereotypically regarded as the weapon of choice of insurgents, gangsters and terrorists. Conversely, throughout the [[developing world]], the AK-47 can be positively attributed with [[revolutionaries]] against foreign occupation, [[imperialism]], or [[colonialism]].&lt;ref name = &quot;NPRKahaner&quot;&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6539945 AK-47: The Weapon Changed the Face of War] by Andrea Seabrook, ''[[NPR]] Weekend Edition Sunday'', 26 November 2006 {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mexico, the AK-47 is known as &quot;Cuerno de Chivo&quot; (literally &quot;Ram's Horn&quot;) because of its curved magazine design and is one of the weapons of choice of Mexican drug cartels. It is sometimes mentioned in Mexican folk music lyrics.&lt;ref name=&quot;AolNews&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Muessig|first=Ben|title=Narcocorridos: The Songs of Mexico's Drug War|url=http://www.aolnews.com/2010/08/10/narcocorridos-the-songs-of-mexicos-drug-war/|publisher=AolNews|accessdate=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Colombian musician and peace activist [[Cesar Lopez|César López]] devised the ''[[escopetarra]]'', an AK converted into a guitar. One sold for US$17,000 in a fundraiser held to benefit the victims of [[anti-personnel mines]], while another was exhibited at the United Nations' [[Conference on Disarmament]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Escopetarras: disparando música | last = Latorre | first = Héctor | date = 24 January 2006 | accessdate =31 January 2007 | publisher = BBC World | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/misc/newsid_4644000/4644028.stm | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070222195808/http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/misc/newsid_4644000/4644028.stm| archivedate= 22 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AK-47 made an appearance in U.S. popular culture as a recurring focus in the 2005 [[Nicolas Cage]] film ''[[Lord of War]]''. There are numerous monologues in the movie focusing on the weapon and its effects on global conflict and the [[gun running]] market, such as:

''&quot;Of all the weapons in the vast Soviet arsenal, nothing was more profitable than Avtomat Kalashnikova model of 1947. More commonly known as the AK-47, or Kalashnikov. It's the world's most popular assault rifle. A weapon all fighters love. An elegantly simple 9 pound amalgamation of forged steel and plywood. It doesn't break, jam, or overheat. It'll shoot whether it's covered in mud or filled with sand. It's so easy, even a child can use it; and they do. The Soviets put the gun on a coin. Mozambique put it on their flag. Since the end of the Cold War, the Kalashnikov has become the Russian people's greatest export. After that comes vodka, caviar, and suicidal novelists. One thing is for sure, no one was lining up to buy their cars.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lord of War (2005) – memorable quotes|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399295/quotes?qt=qt0403308|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kalashnikov Museum==
The Kalashnikov Museum (also called the AK-47 museum) opened on 4 November 2004, in [[Izhevsk]], Udmurt Republic. This city is in the [[Ural Region]] of Russia. The museum chronicles the biography of General [[Mikhail Kalashnikov|Kalashnikov]], and documents the invention of the AK-47. The museum complex of small arms of M. T. Kalashnikov, a series of halls and multimedia exhibitions is devoted to the evolution of the AK-47 assault rifle and attracts 10,000 monthly visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Chivers, C.J.

Nadezhda Vechtomova, the museum director stated in an interview that the purpose of the museum is to honor the ingenuity of the inventor and the hard work of the employees and to &quot;separate the weapon as a weapon of murder from the people who are producing it and to tell its history in our country.&quot;
