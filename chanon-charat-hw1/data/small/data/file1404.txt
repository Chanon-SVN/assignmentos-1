'''Agent Orange''' — or '''Herbicide Orange''' (HO) — is one of the [[herbicide]]s and [[defoliant]]s used by the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. military]] as part of its [[herbicidal warfare]] program, [[Operation Ranch Hand]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Buckingham&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Buckingham|title=The Air Force and Herbicides|url=http://www.afhso.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-100928-054.pdf|publisher=AFHSO}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[Vietnam War]] from 1961 to 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science20.com/news_articles/agent_orange_linked_skin_cancer_risk-128602 Agent Orange Linked To Skin Cancer Risk]&lt;/ref&gt; It was a mixture of equal parts of two herbicides, [[2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid|2,4,5-T]] and [[2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid|2,4-D]].

During the late 1940s and '50s, the US and British collaborated on development of herbicides with potential applications in warfare.  Some of those products were brought to market as herbicides.  The British were the first to employ herbicides and defoliants to destroy the crops, bushes, and trees of communist insurgents in [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]] during the [[Malayan Emergency]].  These operations laid the groundwork for the subsequent use of Agent Orange and other defoliant formulations by the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;MAY&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Global Politics of Pesticides: Forging Consensus from Conflicting Interests |page=61 |author=Bruce Cumings |year=1998 |publisher=[[Earthscan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-1961, President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] of South Vietnam asked the United States to conduct aerial herbicide spraying in his country. In August of that year, the [[South Vietnamese Air Force]] initiated herbicide operations with American help. But Diem's request launched a policy debate in the [[White House]] and the [[State Department|State]] and [[U.S. Department of Defense|Defense Departments]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Buckingham&quot;/&gt; However, U.S. officials considered using it, pointing out that the British had already used herbicides and defoliants during the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s. In November 1961, [[U.S. President|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] authorized the start of Operation Ranch Hand, the codename for the [[U.S. Air Force]]'s herbicide program in Vietnam.

Agent Orange was manufactured for the U.S. Department of Defense primarily by [[Monsanto Corporation]] and [[Dow Chemical]]. It was given its name from the color of the orange-striped [[Drum (container)|barrels]] in which it was shipped, and was by far the most widely used of the so-called &quot;[[Rainbow Herbicides]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;hay-1982-p151&quot; /&gt; The 2,4,5-T used to produce Agent Orange was contaminated with [[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin]] (TCDD), an extremely toxic [[dioxin compound]].  In some areas, TCDD concentrations in soil and water were hundreds of times greater than the levels considered safe by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fawthrop-war-against&quot;&gt;Fawthrop, Tom; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3798581.stm &quot;Vietnam's war against Agent Orange&quot;], ''BBC News'', June 14, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fawthrop-suffering&quot;&gt;Fawthrop, Tom; [http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/feb/10/agentofsuffering &quot;Agent of Suffering&quot;], ''Guardian'', February 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of specific [[Customary international law|customary]] or [[Positive law|positive]] [[international humanitarian law]] regarding herbicidal warfare, a draft convention, prepared by a [[Working group|Working Group]] set up within the [[Conference of the Committee on Disarmament]] (CCD), was submitted to the [[UN General Assembly]] in 1976. In that same year, the [[General Assembly First Committee|First Committee of the General Assembly]] decided to send the text of the draft convention to the General Assembly, which adopted [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 31/72|Resolution 31/72]] on December 10, 1976, with the text of the Convention attached as an annex thereto. The convention, namely the [[Environmental Modification Convention]], was opened for signature and ratification on May 18, 1977, and entered into force in October 5, 1978. The convention prohibits the military or other hostile use of environmental modification techniques having widespread, long-lasting or severe effects. Many states do not regard this as a complete ban on the use of herbicides and defoliants in warfare but it does require case-by-case consideration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://legal.un.org/avl/ha/cpmhuemt/cpmhuemt.html Convention on the Prohibition of the Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_rul_rule76 |title=Practice Relating to Rule 76.

Chemically, Agent Orange is an approximately 1:1 mixture of two [[phenoxyl herbicide]]s – [[2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] ('''2,4-D''') and [[2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid]] ('''2,4,5-T''') – in [[ester|iso-octyl ester]] form.&lt;ref&gt;IOM, 1994: [http://books.google.com/books?id=2YQTHJlt5l4C&amp;pg=PA90 p. 90]&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous studies have examined health effects linked to Agent Orange, its component compounds, and its manufacturing byproducts.&lt;ref name=&quot;frumkin&quot;&gt;Frumkin, 2003: [http://caonline.amcancersoc.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12924777 pp.245–255]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 it was revealed to the public that the 2,4,5-T was contaminated with a dioxin, [[tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin]] ('''TCDD'''), and that the TCDD was causing many of the previously unexplained adverse health effects which were correlated with Agent Orange exposure.&lt;ref&gt;Young, 2009: [http://books.google.com/books?id=1iCHpk2fZksC&amp;pg=PA6 p. 6]&lt;/ref&gt; TCDD has been described as &quot;perhaps the most toxic molecule ever synthesized by man&quot;.(Galston 1979,&lt;ref name=Galston79&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Galston|first1=Authur|title=Herbicides: A Mixed Blessing|journal=Bioscience|date=Feb 1979|volume=29|issue=2|pages=85–90|doi=10.2307/1307744|url=http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/2.toc|accessdate=2014-09-13|jstor=1307744}}&lt;/ref&gt; cited in&lt;ref name=&quot;Schuck&quot;&gt;Schuck, 1987: [http://books.google.com/books?id=waTdqLYCyPMC&amp;pg=PA18 p. 18]&lt;/ref&gt;) Internal memoranda revealed that Monsanto (a major manufacturer of 2,4,5-T) had informed the U.S. government in 1952 that its 2,4,5-T was contaminated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schuck2&quot;&gt;Schuck, 1987: [http://books.google.com/books?id=waTdqLYCyPMC&amp;pg=PA17 p. 17]&lt;/ref&gt; In the manufacture of 2,4,5-T, accidental overheating of the reaction mixture easily causes the product to condense into the toxic self-condensation product TCDD. At the time, precautions were not taken against this unintended side reaction, which caused also the [[Seveso disaster]] in Italy in 1976.

In 1979, [[Yale University|Yale]] [[biologist]] [[Arthur Galston]], who specialized in herbicide research, published a review of what was known at the time about the toxicity of TCDD. Even &quot;vanishingly small&quot; quantities of dioxin in the diet caused adverse health effects when [[animal testing|tested on animals]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schuck&quot; /&gt; Since then, TCDD has been comprehensively studied. It has been associated with increased [[neoplasms]] in every animal [[bioassay]] reported in the scientific literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;dwyer-flesch&quot;&gt;Dwyer and Flesch-Janys, [http://ajph.aphapublications.org/cgi/reprint/85/4/476.pdf &quot;Editorial: Agent Orange in Vietnam&quot;], [[American Journal of Public Health]], April 1995, Vol 85.

Of the two herbicides that make up Agent Orange, 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, the latter is considered to be less biodegradable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://umbbd.ethz.ch/2,4,5-t/2,4,5-t_map.html &quot;2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic Acid Pathway Map&quot;] by Brian Hill and Jiangbi Liu (accessed 2013-06-18)&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1969 report authored by K. Diane Courtney and others found 2,4,5-T could cause birth defects and stillbirths in mice.&lt;ref&gt;Buckingham, 1992: ''Chapter IX – Ranch Hand Ends''&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have shown an increased rate of cancer mortality for workers exposed to 2,4,5-T.

Starting in 1991, Congress asked the [[Institute of Medicine]] to review the scientific literature on Agent Orange and the other herbicides used in Vietnam, including their active ingredients and the dioxin contaminant.

===The discovery of herbicides and defoliants and first use in war===

Several herbicides were discovered as part of efforts by the US and the British to develop herbicidal weapons for use during WWII.  These included [[2,4-D]] (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid), [[2,4,5-T]]  (coded LN-14, and also known as trioxone), [[MCPA]] (2-methyl-4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid, 1414B and 1414A, recoded LN-8 and LN-32), and [[isopropyl phenylcarbamate]] (1313, recoded LN-33).&lt;ref name=&quot;FAB&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Judith Perera and Andy Thomas |date=Apr 18, 1985 |title=This horrible natural experiment|journal=New Scientist, April 18, 1985 |pages=34–36 |accessdate=February 22, 2014|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=q7v_rDK0uOgC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=this+horrible+natural+experiment+Perera+Thomas&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HbDkNQCTEK&amp;sig=aR2tiCHT5HbJfnwXrQg7Erv_4jU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sxakU_rGO4qmsATLjIDYAg&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=this%20horrible%20natural%20experiment%20Perera%20Thomas&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, the U.S. Department of the Army contracted the [[University of Chicago]] to study the effects of [[2,4-D]] and [[2,4,5-T]] on cereal grains (including rice) and broadleaf crops. From these studies arose the concept of using aerial applications of herbicides to destroy enemy crops to disrupt their food supply. In early 1945, the U.S. Army ran tests of various 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T mixtures at the [[Bushnell Army Airfield]] in [[Florida]], which is now listed as a [[Formerly Used Defense Site]] (FUDS). As a result, the U.S. began a full-scale production of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and would have used it against Japan in 1946 during [[Operation Downfall]] if the war had continued.&lt;ref&gt;Young, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p. 111&quot;&gt;Verwey, 1977:&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the war, the relationship between the two countries was well established. In the years after the war, the U.S. tested 1100 compounds and field trials of the more promising ones were done at British stations in India and Australia, to establish their effects in tropical conditions, as well as at the U.S.'s testing ground in Florida.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAB&quot;/&gt;

Between 1950 and 1952, for example, trials were conducted in Tanganyika, at Kikore and Stunyansa, to test arboricides and defoliants under tropical conditions. The chemicals involved were 2,4-D, 2,4,5-T, and endothal (3,6-endoxohexahydrophthalic acid). During 1952/53, the unit supervised the aerial spraying of 2,4,5-T over the Waturi peninsula in Kenya to assess the value of defoliants in the eradication of tsetse fly.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAB&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Sir gerald templer.gif|[[General (United Kingdom)|British General]] [[Gerald Templer|Sir Gerald Templer]] authorized the use of [[2,4,5-T]] and [[2,4-D]] (Agent Orange) throughout the Malayan Emergency to destroy bushes, trees, and vegetation in order to deprive the insurgents of cover. Later, the Americans used Agent Orange during the Vietnam War.|250px|thumb]]

During the [[Malayan Emergency]], Britain was the first nation to employ the use of [[herbicides]] and [[defoliants]] to destroy bushes, trees, and vegetation to deprive insurgents of cover and targeting food crops as part of a starvation campaign in the early 1950s. A detailed account of how the British experimented with the spraying of herbicides was written by two scientists, E.K. Woodford of Agricultural Research Council's Unit of Experimental Agronomy and H.G.H. Kearns of the [[University of Bristol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FAB&quot;/&gt;

After the Malayan conflict ended in 1960, the U.S. considered the British precedent in deciding that the use of defoliants was a [[laws of war|legal tactic of warfare]]. [[U.S. Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Dean Rusk]] advised [[U.S. President|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] that the British had established a precedent for warfare with herbicides in Malaya.&lt;ref name=&quot;MAY&quot;/&gt;

During the Vietnam War, between 1962 and 1971, the United States military sprayed nearly {{convert|20000000|U.S.gal|L|sigfig=3}} of chemical herbicides and defoliants in Vietnam, eastern Laos and parts of Cambodia, as part of the aerial defoliation program known as [[Operation Ranch Hand]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;pellow-2007-159&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;stellman-2003-681-687&quot;&gt;&quot;stellman-2003-681-687&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Like the British did in Malaya, the goal was to defoliate rural/forested land, depriving guerrillas of food and cover and clearing sensitive areas such as around base perimeters.&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Spencer. Encyclopedia of the Vietnam War: Political, Social and Military History. ABC-CLIO, Inc. Santa Barbara. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The program was also a part of a general policy of [[forced draft urbanization]], which aimed to destroy the ability of peasants to support themselves in the countryside, forcing them to flee to the U.S. dominated cities, depriving the guerrillas of their rural support base.&lt;ref name=&quot;stellman-2003-681-687&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kolko-144-145&quot;&gt;&quot;kolko-144-145&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Spraying was usually done either from helicopters or from low-flying [[C-123 Provider]] aircraft, fitted with sprayers and &quot;MC-1 Hourglass&quot; pump systems and {{convert|1000|U.S.gal|L|abbr=on}} chemical tanks. Spray runs were also conducted from trucks, boats, and backpack sprayers.&lt;ref&gt;Schuck, 1987: [http://books.google.com/books?id=waTdqLYCyPMC&amp;pg=PA16 p. 16]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancer.org/Cancer/CancerCauses/OtherCarcinogens/IntheWorkplace/agent-orange-and-cancer?sitearea=PED Agent Orange and Cancer], ''American Cancer Society'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young, 2009: [http://books.google.com/books?id=1iCHpk2fZksC&amp;pg=PA26 p. 26]&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign destroyed {{convert|5|e6acre|km2|sigfig=1}} of upland and mangrove forests and millions of acres of crops. Overall, more than 20% of South Vietnam's forests were sprayed at least once over a nine-year period.&lt;ref name=&quot;kolko-144-145&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;verwey-113&quot; /&gt;

In 1965, members of the [[U.S. Congress]] were told &quot;crop destruction is understood to be the more important purpose&amp;nbsp;... but the emphasis is usually given to the jungle defoliation in public mention of the program.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;verwey-113&quot;&gt;Verwey, 1977: [http://books.google.com/books?id=QgmHOdIjITsC&amp;pg=PA113 p. 113]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Military personnel]] were told they were destroying crops because they were going to be used to feed guerrillas. They later discovered nearly all of the food they had been destroying was not being produced for guerrillas; it was, in reality, only being grown to support the local civilian population. For example, in Quang Ngai province, 85% of the crop lands were scheduled to be destroyed in 1970 alone. This contributed to widespread famine, leaving hundreds of thousands of people malnourished or starving.&lt;ref&gt;Verwey, 1977: [http://books.google.com/books?id=QgmHOdIjITsC&amp;pg=PA116 p. 116]&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. military began targeting food crops in October 1962, primarily using [[Agent Blue]]; the American public was not made aware of the crop destruction programs until 1965 (and it was then believed that crop spraying had begun that spring). In 1965, 42 percent of all herbicide spraying was dedicated to food crops. The first official acknowledgement of the programs came from the [[State Department]] in March 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;p. 111&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kolko-144-145&quot;/&gt;

Many experts at the time, including Arthur Galston, the biologist who developed and intensively studied 2,4,5-T and TCDD, opposed herbicidal warfare, due to concerns about the side effects to humans and the environment by indiscriminately spraying the chemical over a wide area. As early as 1966, resolutions were introduced to the [[United Nations]] charging that the U.S. was violating the 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]], which regulated the use of [[chemical weapons|chemical]] and [[biological weapons]]. The U.S. defeated most of the resolutions,&lt;ref name=&quot;galston-light&quot;&gt;Peterson, Doug [http://www.las.illinois.edu/alumni/magazine/articles/2004/galston Arthur W. Galston: Matters of Light], ''LASNews Magazine'', [[University of Illinois]], Spring 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schuck, 1987. p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that Agent Orange was not a chemical or a biological weapon as it was considered a herbicide and a defoliant and it was used in effort to destroy plant crops to deprive the enemy of cover and not meant to target human beings. A weapon, by definition, is any device used to injure, defeat, or destroy living beings, structures, or systems, and Agent Orange did not qualify under that definition. It also argued that if the U.S. were to be charged for using Agent Orange, then Britain and its Commonwealth nations should be charged since they also used it widely during the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=When Technology Fails: Significant Technological Disasters, Accidents, and Failures of the Twentieth Century |year=1994 |page=104 |author=Igor Primoratz |publisher=[[Overlook Hardcover]] |accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, during a debate in the First Committee of the UN General Assembly on the question of chemical and bacteriological (biological) weapons, Britain stated with respect to the then still draft Resolution 2603 (XXIV): “The evidence seems to us to be notably inadequate for the assertion that the use in war of chemical substances specifically toxic to plants is prohibited by [[international law]].”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_cou_gb_rule76 |title=2.

===Effects on the Vietnamese people===

====Health effects====

The government of Vietnam says that 4 million of its citizens were exposed to Agent Orange, and as many as 3 million have suffered illnesses because of it; these figures include the children of people who were exposed.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Stocking for AP, published in the Seattle Times May 22, 2010 [seattletimes.com/html/health/2011928849_apasvietnamusagentorange.html Vietnam, US still in conflict over Agent Orange]&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Red Cross of Vietnam]] estimates that up to 1 million people are disabled or have health problems due to contaminated Agent Orange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/08/10/world/asia/vietnam-us-agent-orange/ |title=U.S. in first effort to clean up Agent Orange in Vietnam |author=Jessica King |date=2012-08-10|accessdate= 2012-08-11|work=[[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States government has challenged these figures as being unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Defoliation&quot; entry in {{cite book|editor=Spencer C.

According to a study by one Vietnamese scientist, Dr Nguyen Viet Nhan, children in the areas where Agent Orange was used have been affected and have multiple health problems, including cleft palate, mental disabilities, hernias, and [[Polydactyly|extra fingers and toes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Agent Orange blights Vietnam&quot;/&gt; In the 1970s, high levels of dioxin were found in the [[breast milk]] of South Vietnamese women, and in the blood of U.S. military personnel who had served in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Thornton|first=Joe|title=Pandora's Poison: Chlorine, Health, and a New Environmental Strategy|publisher=MIT Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-262-70084-9|page=190|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=n_tXscNndysC&amp;pg=PA190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most affected zones are the mountainous area along Truong Son (Long Mountains) and the border between Vietnam and Cambodia. The affected residents are living in substandard conditions with many [[genetic diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mofa.gov.vn/ Vietnam Ministry of Foreign Affairs] – ''[http://www.mofa.gov.vn/vi/tt_baochi/nr041126171753/ns050118101044 Support Agent Orange Victims]'' in Vietnamese.&lt;/ref&gt;

About 28 of the former U.S. military bases in Vietnam where the herbicides were stored and loaded onto airplanes may still have high level of dioxins in the soil, posing a health threat to the surrounding communities. Extensive testing for dioxin contamination has been conducted at the former U.S. airbases in Da Nang, Phu Cat and Bien Hoa. Some of the soil and sediment on the bases have extremely high levels of dioxin requiring remediation. The Da Nang Airbase has dioxin contamination up to 350 times higher than international recommendations for action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hatfieldgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/AgentOrangeReports/UNDP1391/UNDP1391_Final_VRT_%20Report_and_Appendices.pdf Evaluation of Contamination at the Agent Orange Dioxin Hot Spots in Bien Hoa, Phu Cat and Vicinity, Vietnam].  repared for: Office of the National Committee 33, Ministry of Natural Resource and Environment, Ha Noi, Viet Nam and UNDP Ha Noi, Viet Nam by Viet Nam – Russia Tropical Centre, Ha Noi, Viet Nam with Technical Support Provided by Hatfield Consultants.

====Ecological effects====
{{see also|Environmental impact of war}}
About 17.8 percent—{{convert|3100000|ha|sqmi}}—of the total forested area of Vietnam was sprayed during the war, which disrupted the ecological equilibrium. The persistent nature of dioxins, erosion caused by loss of tree cover and loss of seedling forest stock meant that reforestation was difficult (or impossible) in many areas.&lt;ref&gt;Furukawa, 2004: [http://books.google.com/books?id=jPL4wSfgan4C&amp;pg=PA215 p. 215]&lt;/ref&gt; Many defoliated forest areas were quickly invaded by aggressive pioneer species (such as [[bamboo]] and [[cogon grass]]), which make it unlikely that the forests will be able to regenerate. Animal-species [[biodiversity|diversity]] was also impacted; in one study a Harvard biologist found 24 species of birds and five species of [[mammals]] in a sprayed forest, while in two adjacent sections of unsprayed forest there were 145 and 170 species of birds and 30 and 55 species of mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chiras, Daniel D.|title=Environmental science|year=2010|edition=8th|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett|isbn=978-0-7637-5925-4|page=499|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=L28bHnPXo1AC&amp;pg=PA499}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dioxins from Agent Orange have persisted in the Vietnamese environment since the war, settling in the soil and sediment and entering the [[food chain]] through animals and fish which feed in the contaminated areas. The movement of dioxins through the [[food web]] has resulted in [[bioconcentration]] and [[biomagnification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Vallero, Daniel A.|title=Biomedical ethics for engineers: ethics and decision making in biomedical and biosystem engineering|year=2007|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-7506-8227-5|page=73|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AeT56Pi8LFYC&amp;pg=PA73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The areas most heavily contaminated with dioxins are former U.S. air bases.&lt;ref&gt;Furukawa, 2004: [http://books.google.com/books?id=jPL4wSfgan4C&amp;pg=PA221 pp. 221–222]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sociopolitical effects====
The [[RAND Corporation]]'s ''Memorandum 5446-ISA/ARPA'' states: &quot;the fact that the VC obtain most of their food from the neutral rural population dictates the destruction of civilian crops&amp;nbsp;... if they (the VC) are to be hampered by the crop destruction program, it will be necessary to destroy large portions of the rural economy – probably 50% or more&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Verwey, 1977: [http://books.google.com/books?id=QgmHOdIjITsC&amp;pg=PA115 p.115]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rural-to-urban migration rates dramatically increased in South Vietnam, as peasants escaped the war in the countryside by fleeing to the cities. The urban population in South Vietnam nearly tripled, growing from 2.8 million people in 1958 to 8 million by 1971. The rapid flow of people led to a fast-paced and uncontrolled urbanization; an estimated 1.5 million people were living in Saigon slums.&lt;ref name=&quot;pp. 4&quot;&gt;Luong, 2003: [http://books.google.com/books?id=AkIhYEavBrEC&amp;pg=PA4 pp. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on U.S. veterans===
Some studies showed that veterans who served in the South during the war have increased rates of cancer, and nerve, digestive, skin, and respiratory disorders. Veterans from the south had higher rates of throat cancer, acute/chronic leukemia, [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]] and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, prostate cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, soft tissue sarcoma and liver cancer. With the exception of liver cancer, these are the same conditions the [[U.S. Veterans Administration]] has determined may be associated with exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin, and are on the list of conditions eligible for compensation and treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;va-03-2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/diseases.asp |title=Agent Orange: Diseases Associated with Agent Orange Exposure |publisher=Department of Veterans Affairs Office of Public Health and Environmental Hazards |date=March 25, 2010 |accessdate=May 4, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100509191150/http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/diseases.asp| archivedate= 9 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military personnel who loaded [[airplanes]] and [[helicopters]] used in Ranch Hand probably sustained some of the heaviest exposures. Members of the [[Army Chemical Corps]], who stored and mixed herbicides and defoliated the perimeters of military bases, and mechanics who worked on the helicopters and planes, are also thought to have had some of the heaviest exposures. However, this same group of individuals has not shown remarkably higher incidences of the associated diseases. Others with potentially heavy exposures included members of [[U.S. Army Special Forces]] units who defoliated remote campsites, and members of [[U.S. Navy]] river units who cleared base perimeters.&lt;ref&gt;Frumkin, 2003: p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  Military members who served on [[Okinawa]] also claim to have been exposed to the chemical but there is no verifiable evidence to corroborate these claims.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Jon, &quot;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20110412zg.html Evidence for Agent Orange on Okinawa]&quot;, ''[[Japan Times]]'', 12 April 2011, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Vietnam, the veterans were told not to worry, and were persuaded the chemical was harmless.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann, Kenneth J.; [http://politicalaffairs.net/killing-me-softly-how-agent-orange-murders-vietnam-s-children/ &quot;Killing Me Softly: How Agent Orange Murders Vietnam's Children&quot;], ''Political Affairs'', April 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; After returning home, Vietnam veterans began to suspect their ill health or the instances of their wives having miscarriages or children born with birth defects might be related to Agent Orange and the other toxic herbicides to which they were exposed in Vietnam. Veterans began to file claims in 1977 to the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] for disability payments for health care for conditions they believed were associated with exposure to Agent Orange, or more specifically, dioxin, but their claims were denied unless they could prove the condition began when they were in the service or within one year of their discharge.

By April 1993, the Department of Veterans Affairs had only compensated 486 victims, although it had received disability claims from 39,419 soldiers who had been exposed to Agent Orange while serving in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Fleischer|first1=Doris Zames|last2=Zames|first2=Freida|title=The disability rights movement: from charity to confrontation|publisher=Temple University Press|year=2001|isbn=978-1-56639-812-1|page=178|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3t84d8tLEVcC&amp;pg=PA178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal and diplomatic proceedings===

====U.S. veterans class action lawsuit against manufacturers====
Since at least 1978, several lawsuits have been filed against the companies which produced Agent Orange, among them [[Dow Chemical Company|Dow Chemical]], [[Monsanto Company|Monsanto]], and [[Diamond Shamrock]].

[[Hy Mayerson]] of [[The Mayerson Law Offices, P.C.]] was an early pioneer in Agent Orange litigation, working with [[environmentalism|environmental attorney]] [[Victor Yannacone]] in 1980 on the first class-action suits against wartime manufacturers of Agent Orange. In meeting Dr. Ronald A. Codario, one of the first civilian doctors to see afflicted patients, Mayerson, so impressed by the fact a physician would show so much interest in a Vietnam veteran, forwarded more than a thousand pages of information on Agent Orange and the effects of dioxin on animals and humans to Codario's office the day after he was first contacted by the doctor.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Wilcox, 1983: {{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corporate defendants sought to escape culpability by blaming everything on the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Scott|first=Wilbur J.|title=The Politics of Readjustment: Vietnam Veterans Since the War|publisher=Transaction|year=1993|isbn=978-0-202-30406-9|page=130|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YLg8rVfYO9EC&amp;pg=PA130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mayerson law firm, with Sgt. [[Charles E. Hartz]] as their principal client, filed the first U.S. Agent Orange class-action lawsuit, in [[Pennsylvania]] in 1980, for the injuries military personnel in Vietnam suffered through exposure to toxic dioxins in the [[defoliant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1347&amp;dat=19800125&amp;id=ZdMSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0_oDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5065,3012612 |title='&amp;#39;Dying Veteran May Speak From Beyond The Grave In Court: Lakeland Ledger |publisher=News.google.com |date=1980-01-25 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attorney Hy Mayerson co-wrote the brief that certified the Agent Orange Product Liability action as a [[class action]], the largest ever filed as of its filing.&lt;ref&gt;Croft, Steve; [http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=270939 Agent Orange], ''CBS Evening News'', May 7, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Hartz's [[Deposition (law)|deposition]] was one of the first ever taken in America, and the first for an Agent Orange trial, for the purpose of preserving [[testimony]] at trial, as it was understood that Hartz would not live to see the trial because of a [[brain tumor]] that began to develop while he was a member of [[Tiger Force]], [[Special Forces]], and [[LRRPs]] in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayerson.com/html/about.html |title=The Mayerson Law Offices |publisher=The Mayerson Law Offices |accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pottsmerc.com/ |title=Pottstown Mercury |publisher=Pottsmerc.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm also located and supplied critical research to the Veterans' lead expert, Dr. Ronald A. Codario, M.D., including about 100 articles from toxicology journals dating back more than a decade, as well as data about where herbicides had been sprayed, what the effects of dioxin had been on animals and humans, and every accident in factories where herbicides were produced or dioxin was a contaminant of some chemical reaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

The chemical companies involved denied that there was a link between Agent Orange and the veterans' medical problems.  However, on May 7, 1984, seven chemical companies settled the class-action suit out of court just hours before jury selection was to begin.  The companies agreed to pay $180 million as compensation if the veterans dropped all claims against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editors=Stanley, Jay; Blair, John D.|title=Challenges in military health care: perspectives on health status and the provision of care| publisher=Transaction Publishers| year=1993|isbn=978-1-56000-650-3|page=164| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8k-WIJYwIF4C&amp;pg=PA164}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Slightly over 45% of the sum was ordered to be paid by Monsanto alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Harrington|first=John C.|title=The challenge to power: money, investing, and democracy|publisher=Chelsea Green Publisher|year=2005|isbn=978-1-931498-97-5|page=260|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wGgeiQvijI8C&amp;pg=PT260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many veterans who were victims of Agent Orange exposure were outraged the case had been settled instead of going to court, and felt they had been betrayed by the lawyers. &quot;Fairness Hearings&quot; were held in five major American cities, where veterans and their families discussed their reactions to the settlement, and condemned the actions of the lawyers and courts, demanding the case be heard before a jury of their peers. Federal Judge Julius Weinstein refused the appeals, claiming the settlement was &quot;fair and just&quot;. By 1989, the veterans' fears were confirmed when it was decided how the money from the settlement would be paid out. A totally disabled Vietnam veteran would receive a maximum of $12,000 spread out over the course of 10 years. Furthermore, by accepting the settlement payments, disabled veterans would become ineligible for many state benefits that provided far more monetary support than the settlement, such as food stamps, public assistance, and government pensions. A widow of a Vietnam veteran who died of Agent Orange exposure would only receive $3700.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxford-milhist-725&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Chambers, John Whiteclay|editor2=Anderson, Fred|title=The Oxford companion to American military history|chapter=Toxic Agents: Agent Orange Exposure|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999| isbn=978-0-19-507198-6|page=725| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_Rzy_yNMKbcC&amp;pg=PA725}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Monsanto spokesman Jill Montgomery said Monsanto should not be liable at all for injuries or deaths caused by Agent Orange, saying: &quot;We are sympathetic with people who believe they have been injured and understand their concern to find the cause, but reliable scientific evidence indicates that Agent Orange is not the cause of serious long-term health effects.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Agent Orange Victims Sue Monsanto| last=Fawthrop|first=Tom| work=CorpWatch|date=November 4, 2004|url=http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=11638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New Jersey Agent Orange Commission====
In 1980, [[New Jersey]] created the New Jersey Agent Orange Commission, the first state commission created to study its effects. The commission's research project in association with [[Rutgers University]] was called &quot;The Pointman Project&quot;. It was disbanded by Governor [[Christine Todd Whitman]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Prestin|first1=Terry|title=Agent Orange Panel Closes|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/03/nyregion/new-jersey-daily-briefing-agent-orange-panel-closes.html|accessdate=13 September 2014|work=The New York Times|issue=Section B; Page 1; Column 1|date=July 3, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Pointman I, commission researchers devised ways to determine small dioxin levels in blood. Prior to this, such levels could only be found in the [[adipose tissue|adipose (fat) tissue]]. The project studied dioxin ([[2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin|TCDD]]) levels in blood as well as in adipose tissue in a small group of Vietnam veterans who had been exposed to Agent Orange and compared them to those of a matched control group; the levels were found to be higher in the former group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=371123 &quot;Dioxins and Dibenzofurans in Blood and Adipose Tissue of Agent Orange—Exposed Vietnam Veterans and Matched Controls&quot;], ''Journal of the American Medical Association'', Vol. 259 No. 11, March 18, 1988, p. 1661–1667&lt;/ref&gt;

The second phase of the project continued to examine and compare dioxin levels in various groups of Vietnam veterans, including [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] and [[Brownwater Navy|brown water riverboat Navy]] personnel.

====U.S. Congress====
In 1991, Congress enacted the [[Agent Orange Act of 1991|Agent Orange Act]], giving the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] the authority to declare certain conditions 'presumptive' to exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin, making these veterans who served in Vietnam eligible to receive treatment and compensation for these conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.va.gov/AgentOrange/ |title=Agent Orange – Office of Public Health and Environmental Hazards |publisher=.va.gov |date=2009-11-11 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same law required the [[National Academy of Sciences]] to periodically review the science on dioxin and herbicides used in Vietnam to inform the [[Secretary of Veterans Affairs]] about the strength of the scientific evidence showing association between exposure to Agent Orange/dioxin and certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www7.nationalacademies.org/ocga/laws/PL102-4.asp |title=PL 102-4 and The National Academy of Sciences |publisher=.nationalacademies.org |date=1981-11-03 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through this process, the list of 'presumptive' conditions has grown since 1991, and currently the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has listed prostate cancer, respiratory cancers, multiple myeloma, type II diabetes, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, soft tissue sarcoma, [[chloracne]], porphyria cutanea tarda, peripheral neuropathy, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and spina bifida in children of veterans exposed to Agent Orange as conditions associated with exposure to the herbicide. This list now includes B cell leukemias, such as hairy cell leukemia, Parkinson's disease and ischemic heart disease, these last three having been added on August 31, 2010. Several highly placed individuals in government are voicing concerns about whether some of the diseases on the list should, in fact, actually have been included.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.airforcetimes.com/news/2010/08/ap-aging-vets-concern-083110/|title=Costs of aging vets concern deficit commission|last=Baker|first=Mike|date=September 2, 2010|work=The Air Force Times|accessdate=September 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====U.S.–Vietnamese government negotiations====
In 2002, Vietnam and the U.S. held a joint conference on Human Health and Environmental Impacts of Agent Orange. Following the conference, the U.S. [[National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences]] (NIEHS) began scientific exchanges between the U.S. and Vietnam, and began discussions for a joint research project on the human health impacts of Agent Orange.&lt;ref name=&quot;p. 310&quot;&gt;Young, 2009: [http://books.google.com/books?id=1iCHpk2fZksC&amp;pg=PA310 p. 310]&lt;/ref&gt;

These negotiations broke down in 2005, when neither side could agree on the research protocol and the research project was cancelled. More progress has been made on the environmental front. In 2005, the first U.S.-Vietnam workshop on remediation of dioxin was held.&lt;ref name=&quot;p. 310&quot;/&gt;

Starting in 2005, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) began to work with the Vietnamese government to measure the level of dioxin at the [[Da Nang Airbase]]. Also in 2005, the Joint Advisory Committee on Agent Orange, made up of representatives of Vietnamese and U.S. government agencies, was established. The committee has been meeting yearly to explore areas of scientific cooperation, technical assistance and environmental remediation of dioxin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://vietnam.usembassy.gov/pr081209.html|title = US, Vietnam to Hold Fourth Joint Advisory Meeting on Agent Orange/Dioxin |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A breakthrough in the diplomatic stalemate on this issue occurred as a result of United States President [[George W. Bush]]'s state visit to Vietnam in November 2006. In the joint statement, President Bush and [[President Triet]] agreed &quot;further joint efforts to address the environmental contamination near former dioxin storage sites would make a valuable contribution to the continued development of their bilateral relationship.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eap/rls/prs/76322.htm |title=Joint Statement Between the Socialist Republic of Vietnam and the United States of America |last1= Bush |first1=George |last2= Triet |first2=Nguyen Minh |date=November 17, 2006 |website=U.S Department of State |publisher=Office of the Press Secretary |accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 25, 2007, President Bush signed the [[U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007]] into law for the [[Iraq War|wars in Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] that included an earmark of $3 million specifically for funding for programs for the remediation of dioxin 'hotspots' on former U.S. [[military bases]], and for public health programs for the surrounding communities;&lt;ref&gt;Martin, May 2009: p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; some authors consider this to be completely inadequate, pointing out that the U.S. [[airbase]] in [[Da Nang]], alone, will cost $14 million to clean up, and that three others are estimated to require $60 million for cleanup.&lt;ref name=&quot;fawthrop-suffering&quot; /&gt; The appropriation was renewed in the fiscal year 2009 and again in FY 2010.

====Vietnamese victims class action lawsuit in U.S. courts====
On January 31, 2004, a [[victim's rights group]], the Vietnam Association for Victims of Agent Orange/dioxin (VAVA), filed a lawsuit in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York]] in [[Brooklyn]], against several U.S. companies for liability in causing personal injury, by developing, and producing the chemical, and claimed that the use of Agent Orange violated the [[Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare]], 1925 [[Geneva Protocol]], and the 1949 [[Geneva Conventions]]. Dow Chemical and Monsanto were the two largest producers of Agent Orange for the U.S. military, and were named in the suit, along with the dozens of other companies (Diamond Shamrock, Uniroyal, Thompson Chemicals, Hercules, etc.). On March 10, 2005, Judge [[Jack B. Weinstein]] of the Eastern District – who had presided over the 1984 U.S. veterans class-action lawsuit – dismissed the lawsuit, ruling there was no legal basis for the [[plaintiff|plaintiffs']] claims. He concluded Agent Orange was not considered a poison under [[international law]] at the time of its use by the U.S.; the U.S. was not prohibited from using it as a herbicide; and the companies which produced the substance were not liable for the method of its use by the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_cou_us_rule76 United States of America Practice Relating to Rule 76. Herbicides]&lt;/ref&gt; Weinstein used the British example to help dismissed the claims of people exposed to Agent Orange in their suit against the chemical companies that had supplied it.

{{quote|The [[U.S. Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]'s [[DARPA|Advanced Research Project Agency]]'s (ARPA) [[Project AGILE]] was instrumental in the United States' development of herbicides as a military weapon, an undertaking inspired by the British use of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T to destroy jungle-grown crops and bushes during the insurgency in Malaya. The United States considered British precedent in deciding that the use of defoliants was a legally accepted tactic of war. On November 24, 1961, [[U.S. Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Dean Rusk]] advised [[U.S. President|President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] that herbicide use in Vietnam would be lawful, saying that &quot;[t]he use of defoliant does not violate any rule of international law concerning the conduct of chemical warfare and is an accepted tactic of war. Precedent has been established by the British during the emergency in Malaya in their use of helicopters for destroying crops by chemical spraying.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Literary Cold War, 1945 to Vietnam |author=Adam Piette |date=May 25, 2009 |pages=201–202 |publisher=[[Edinburgh University Press]] |isbn=0-7486-3527-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1961-63v01/d275 Foreign Relations of the United States, 1961–1963 Volume I, Vietnam, 1961, Document 275]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

George Jackson stated that &quot;if the Americans were guilty of war crimes for using Agent Orange in Vietnam, then the British would be also guilty of war crimes as well since they were the first nation to deploy the use of herbicides and defoliants in warfare and used them on a large scale throughout the Malayan Emergency. Not only was there no outcry by other states in response to Britain's use, but the U.S. viewed it as establishing a precedent for the use of herbicides and defoliants in [[jungle warfare]].&quot; The U.S. government was also not a party in the lawsuit, due to [[sovereign immunity]], and the court ruled the chemical companies, as contractors of the U.S. government, shared the same immunity.

The case was appealed and heard by the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] in [[Manhattan]] on June 18, 2007. Three judges on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Weinstein's ruling to dismiss the case. They ruled that, though the herbicides contained a dioxin (a known poison), they were not intended to be used as a poison on humans. Therefore, they were not considered a chemical weapon and thus not a violation of international law. A further review of the case by the whole panel of judges of the Court of Appeals also confirmed this decision. The lawyers for the Vietnamese filed a petition to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] to hear the case. On March 2, 2009, the Supreme Court denied [[certiorari]] and refused to reconsider the ruling of the Court of Appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warlegacies.org/Agent%20Orange/Appealdecision.pdf |title=February 22, 2008 Decision by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals re: Vietnam Association of Victims of Agent Orange v.

In a November 2004 [[Zogby International]] poll of 987 people, 79% of respondents thought the U.S. chemical companies which produced Agent Orange defoliant should compensate U.S. soldiers who were affected by the toxic chemical used during the war in Vietnam. Also, 51% said they supported compensation for Vietnamese Agent Orange victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Most Americans favor compensation for Agent Orange victims|url=http://vietnamembassy-usa.org/relations/most-americans-favor-compensation-agent-orange-victims|last1=Nguyen|first1=H.|date=19 November 2004|website=Embassy of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in the United States|publisher=Thanh Nien News|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Help for those affected in Vietnam===
To assist those who have been affected by Agent Orange/dioxin, the Vietnamese have established &quot;peace villages&quot;, which each host between 50 and 100 victims, giving them medical and psychological help. As of 2006, there were 11 such villages, thus granting some social protection to fewer than a thousand victims. U.S. veterans of the war in Vietnam and individuals who are aware and sympathetic to the impacts of Agent Orange have supported these programs in Vietnam. An international group of veterans from the U.S. and its allies during the Vietnam War working with their former enemy&amp;nbsp;— veterans from the Vietnam Veterans Association&amp;nbsp;— established the Vietnam Friendship Village&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.vietnamfriendship.org |title = Vietnam Friendship Village Project |accessdate=August 18, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080917012142/http://www.vietnamfriendship.org/| archivedate= 17 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; outside of [[Hanoi]].

The center provides medical care, rehabilitation and vocational training for children and veterans from Vietnam who have been affected by Agent Orange. In 1998, The [[Vietnam Red Cross]] established the Vietnam Agent Orange Victims Fund to provide direct assistance to families throughout Vietnam that have been affected. In 2003, the [[Vietnam Association of Victims of Agent Orange]] (VAVA) was formed. In addition to filing the lawsuit against the chemical companies, VAVA provides medical care, rehabilitation services and financial assistance to those injured by Agent Orange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.vava.org.vn/modules.php?name=News&amp;op=viewcat&amp;catid=25 |title = Vietnam Association of Victims of Agent Orange |accessdate=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vietnamese government provides small monthly stipends to more than 200,000 Vietnamese believed affected by the herbicides; this totaled $40.8 million in 2008 alone. The Vietnam Red Cross has raised more than $22 million to assist the ill or disabled, and several U.S. foundations, United Nations agencies, European governments and nongovernmental organizations have given a total of about $23 million for site cleanup, reforestation, health care and other services to those in need.&lt;ref&gt;Statement by Amb.

'''''Queensland'''''

In 2008, Australian researcher Jean Williams claimed that cancer rates in the town of Innisfail, Queensland were 10 times higher than the state average due to secret testing of Agent Orange by the Australian military scientists during the Vietnam War. Williams, who had won the Order of Australia medal for her research on the effects of chemicals on U.S. war veterans, based her allegations on Australian government reports found in the Australian War Memorial's archives. A former soldier, Ted Bosworth, backed up the claims, saying that he had been involved in the secret testing. Neither Williams or Bosworth have produced verifiable evidence to support their claims. The Queensland health department determined that cancer rates in Innisfail were no higher than those in other parts of the state.&lt;ref&gt;McMahon, Barbara; [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/may/19/australia &quot;Australia cancer deaths linked to Agent Orange&quot;], ''Guardian'', May 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Toronto Star reported that, &quot;records from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s show forestry workers, often students and junior rangers, spent weeks at a time as human markers holding red, helium-filled balloons on fishing lines while low-flying planes sprayed toxic herbicides including an infamous chemical mixture known as Agent Orange on the brush and the boys below.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;StarExclusive&quot; /&gt;

'''''British Columbia'''''

Records show tens of thousands of gallons of the toxic mixture were applied to clear brush near highways and along power lines in the late 1960s and early 1970s – and in some cases the substance was sprayed next to homes. In B.C., the mix of 2-4-D and 2-4-5-T was called &quot;Type B Weed and Brush Killer&quot; in government invoices. Sometimes, the engineers ordered 2-4-5-T by itself, and dubbed it &quot;Type C Weed and Brush Killer.&quot;

In total, about 26,000 gallons of Type B Weed and Brush Killer were ordered between 1965 and 1972. About 10,000 gallons of Type C Weed and Brush Killer were ordered in the same time period. The barrels were shipped to all four of the regions of B.C. as designated by the Ministry of Highways: Kamloops, Nelson, Prince George and Vancouver.

In 1976, documents from BC Hydro show 2-4-5-T and 2-4-D was sprayed along Hydro lines Vernon-Monashee and Nicola-Brenda circuits. The documents also say &quot;brushkiller&quot; was sprayed in Pemberton and Daisy Lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bc.ctvnews.ca/toxic-agent-orange-sprayed-in-b-c-documents-1.791471 | title=Toxic 'Agent Orange' sprayed in B.C.: documents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of chemicals present in the island’s soil together with resolutions passed by [[Legislature of Guam|Guam’s legislature]] suggest that Agent Orange was among the herbicides routinely used on and around military bases [[Anderson Air Force Base]], [[Naval Air Station Agana]], [[Guam]]. Despite the evidence, the Department of Defense continues to deny that Agent Orange was ever stored or used on Guam.  Several Guam veterans have collected an enormous amount of evidence to assist in their disability claims for direct exposure to dioxin containing herbicides such as 2,4,5-T which are similar to the illness associations and disability coverage that has become standard for those who were harmed by the same chemical contaminant of Agent Orange used in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dimond2013&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/the-hero-project/articles/2013/09/25/were-vets-who-served-in-guam-exposed-to-agent-orange-and-denied-benefits.html |title=Were Vets Who Served in Guam Exposed to Agent Orange and Denied Benefits? |last1= Dimond |first1=Diane |date=September 25, 2013  |website= The Hero Project |publisher=The Daily Beast |accessdate=September 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Korean Ministry of Environment announced that they will request cooperative investigation at Camp Carroll officially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://korea.kr/newsWeb/pages/brief/partNews2/view.do?dataId=155750435&amp;call_from=extlink&amp;call_from=extlink |title = Release copy of Ministry Of Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The USFK issued a statement that confirmed that barrels were buried there, but all (plus an additional 60 tons of soil) were removed in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.military.com/news/article/army-no-evidence-of-agent-orange-at-camp-carroll.html | title = Army: No evidence of Agent Orange on Camp Carroll}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, veterans who provide evidence meeting VA requirements for service in Vietnam, and who can medically establish that anytime after this 'presumptive exposure' they developed any medical problems on the list of presumptive diseases, may receive compensation from the VA. Certain veterans who served in Korea and are able to prove they were assigned to certain specified around the DMZ during a specific time frame are afforded similar presumption.&lt;ref&gt;38 CFR 3.307(a)(6)(iv)&lt;/ref&gt; The differences in requirements between Vietnam and Korea service stem from the fact that congress has not made any laws to provide for the same sweeping presumption of exposure similar to the Agent Orange Act of 1991 for Korean veterans.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Parts of Laos were sprayed with Agent Orange during the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/10/world/asia/us-moves-to-address-agent-orange-contamination-in-vietnam.html|title=4 Decades on, U.S. Starts Cleanup of Agent Orange in Vietnam|accessdate=May 5, 2014| location=New York|work=The New York Times|date=August 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
[[File:Ivon Watkins Dow factory, New Plymouth.jpg|thumb|The Ivon Watkins-Dow factory in [[New Plymouth]], New Zealand]]
The use of Agent Orange has been controversial in New Zealand, because of the exposure of New Zealand troops in Vietnam and because of the production of Agent Orange for Vietnam and other users at an Ivon Watkins-Dow chemical plant in Paritutu, [[New Plymouth]]. There have been continuing claims, as yet unproven, that the suburb of Paritutu has also been polluted; see [[New Zealand in the Vietnam War#Agent Orange|New Zealand in the Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;;NZPA [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/dioxin/news/article.cfm?c_id=675&amp;objectid=10412402 &quot;Concern prompts review of Dioxin study&quot;], ''New Zealand Herald'', November 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
There are cases of New Zealand soldiers developing cancers such as bone cancer but none has been scientifically connected to exposure to herbicides.

===Philippines===
Herbicide persistence studies of Agents Orange and White were conducted in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= |title=Preliminary Proposals for the Study of Persistence of Herbicides in Forest and Mangrove Soil |last1=Fryer |first1=J.

[[File:Agent Orange at Johnston Atoll 1976.jpg|thumb|right|Rusting Agent Orange barrels at Johnston Atoll, circa 1976.]]
The [[U.S. Air Force]] operation to remove Herbicide Orange from Vietnam in 1972 was named [[Operation Pacer IVY]] while the operation to destroy the Agent Orange stored at [[Johnston Atoll]] in 1977 was named [[Operation Pacer HO]]. Operation Pacer IVY (InVentorY) collected Agent Orange in [[South Vietnam]] and removed it in 1972 aboard the ship {{MV|Transpacific}} for storage on Johnston Atoll.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.denix.osd.mil/shf/HerbicideOrange.cfm |title = Investigations into Allegations of Herbicide Orange on Okinawa, Japan  |last = Young |first = Alvin L. |publisher = Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (I &amp; E)|date = January 2013 |accessdate= March 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) reports that 1,800,000 gallons of Herbicide Orange was stored at Johnson Island in the Pacific and 480,000 gallons at Gulfport Mississippi.&lt;ref name=Sierra&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Adobe/PDF/910096MY.PDF |title=Final report of the Federal Task Force for Hazardous Materials Management of the Western Federal Regional Council Region IX, August 1, 1973 to June 30, 1977| last1=Bourns |first1=Charles T. |date=March 1, 1978 |work= |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=16 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research and studies were initiated to find a safe method to destroy the materials and it was discovered they could be incinerated safely under special conditions of temperature and dwell time.&lt;ref name=Sierra /&gt; However, these herbicides were expensive and the Air Force wanted to resell its surplus instead of dumping it at sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guam&quot; /&gt;  Among many methods tested, a possibility of salvaging the herbicides by reprocessing and filtering out the [[2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin]] (TCDD) contaminant with carbonized (charcoaled) coconut fibers. This concept was then tested in 1976 and a pilot plant constructed at Gulfport, Mississippi.&lt;ref name=Sierra /&gt;

From July to September 1977 during [[Operation Pacer HO]] (Herbicide Orange), the entire stock of Agent Orange from both Herbicide Orange storage sites at [[Gulfport, Mississippi]] and Johnston Atoll was subsequently [[incinerated]] in four separate burns in the vicinity of Johnson Island aboard the Dutch-owned waste incineration ship {{ship|MT|Vulcanus}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guam&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Phase II Environmental Baseline Survey, Johnston Atoll, Appendix B, page B19-20,|url=http://www.guamagentorange.info/yahoo_site_admin/assets/docs/Johnston_Atoll_History.261114404.pdf|accessdate=August 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2004, some records of the storage and disposition of Agent Orange at [[Johnston Atoll]] have been associated with the historical records of [[Operation Red Hat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NARA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Richard Myers response to The Honorable Lane Evans|url=http://38uscode.com/booklets/Issues/Agent%20Orange/Agent%20Orange/Okinawa/pesticides.pdf|accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Okinawa, Japan===

There have been dozens of reports in the press about use and/or storage of military formulated herbicides on Okinawa that are based upon statements by former U.S. service members that had been stationed on the island, photographs, government records, and unearthed storage barrels. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has denied these allegations with statements by military officials and spokespersons, as well as a January 2013 report authored by Dr. Alvin Young that was released in April 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;blanket2013&quot;&gt;http://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2013/06/04/issues/as-evidence-of-agent-orange-in-okinawa-stacks-up-u-s-sticks-with-blanket-denial/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:An Ecological Assessment of Johnston Atoll cover.png|thumb|left|A scientific study of the effects military contamination at Johnston Atoll included a statement confirming records of Agent Orange storage in Okinawa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ecological&quot; /&gt;]]

In particular, the 2013 report refuted articles written by journalist Jon Mitchell as well as a statement from [http://www.cma.army.mil/fndocumentviewer.aspx?docid=003673775 &quot;An Ecological Assessment of Johnston Atoll&quot;] a 2003 publication produced by the [[United States Army Chemical Materials Agency]] that states, &quot;in 1972, the U.S. Air Force also brought about 25,000 55-gallon (208L) drums of the chemical, Herbicide Orange (HO) to Johnston Island that originated from Vietnam and was stored on Okinawa.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ecological&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=&quot;An Ecological Assessment of Johnston Island,&quot; produced through funding from the Chemical Materials Agency, United States Department of the Army. Page 4|url=http://www.cma.army.mil/fndocumentviewer.aspx?docid=003673775|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 report stated: &quot;The authors of the [2003] report were not DoD employees, nor were they likely familiar with the issues surrounding Herbicide Orange or its actual history of transport to the Island.&quot; and detailed the transport phases and routes of Agent Orange from Vietnam to Johnston Atoll, none of which included Okinawa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young&quot;/&gt;

Further official confirmation of restricted (dioxin containing) herbicide storage on Okinawa appeared in a 1971 Fort Detrick report titled &quot;Historical, Logistical, Political and Technical Aspects of the Herbicide/Defoliant Program&quot;, which mentioned that the environmental statement should consider &quot;Herbicide stockpiles elsewhere in PACOM (Pacific Command) U.S. Government restricted materials Thailand and Okinawa ([[Kadena AFB]]).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stockpile&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= &quot;Herbicide Stockpile&quot; at Kadena Air Base, Okinawa: 1971 U.S. Army report on Agent Orange |first=Jon |last=Mitchell |url=http://japanfocus.org/-Jon-Mitchell/3883 |newspaper=The Asia-Pacific Journal, Vol 11, Issue 1, No. 5, |date=January 14, 2012 |accessdate=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 DoD report says that the environmental statement urged by the 1971 report was published in 1974 as &quot;The Department of Air Force Final Environmental Statement&quot;, and that the latter did not find Agent Orange was held in either Thailand or Okinawa.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;blanket2013&quot;/&gt;

===Thailand===
Agent Orange was tested by the United States in Thailand during the war in Southeast Asia.  Buried drums were uncovered and confirmed to be Agent Orange in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Agent Orange Found Under Resort Airport |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1999-05-26/news/9905260083_1_agent-orange-chemical-birth-defects|work=Chicago tribune News |location=Chicago, IL |date=May 26, 1999 |agency=Tribune News Services }}&lt;/ref&gt; Workers who uncovered the drums fell ill while upgrading the airport near Hua Hin, 100&amp;nbsp;km south of Bangkok.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Boonthan last=Sakanond|title=THAILAND: Toxic Legacy of the Vietnam War|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/1999/05/thailand-toxic-legacy-of-the-vietnam-war/ |work=Inter Press Service News Agency |location=Bangkok, Thailand |date=May 19, 1999 |agency=Inter Press Service }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vietnam-era Veterans whose service involved duty on or near the perimeters of military bases in Thailand anytime between February 28, 1961 and May 7, 1975 may have been exposed to herbicides and may qualify for VA benefits. A claim for direct exposure is possible if the individual can verify that they worked or lived in close proximity to the affected areas of the bases in Thailand.

A declassified Department of Defense report written in 1973, suggests that there was a significant use of herbicides on the fenced-in perimeters of military bases in Thailand to remove foliage that provided cover for enemy forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afhra.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-080819-065.pdf Project CHECO Southeast Asia Report: Base Defense in Thailand 1968–1972] (8.3 MB, PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 VA determined that herbicides used on the Thailand base perimeters may have been tactical and procured from Vietnam, or a strong, commercial type resembling tactical herbicides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/thailand.asp |title=Thailand Military Bases and Agent Orange Exposure |deadurl=no |accessdate=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The [[University of Hawaii]] has acknowledged extensive testing of Agent Orange on behalf of the United States Department of Defense in Hawaii along with mixtures of Agent Orange on Kaua'i Island in 1967-68 and on Hawaii Island in 1966; testing and storage in other U.S. locations has been documented by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;http://archives.starbulletin.com/2005/03/27/editorial/special2.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/outside_vietnam_usa.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, the C-123 aircraft used for spraying Agent Orange were returned to the United States and assigned various East Coast USAF Reserve squadrons, and then employed in traditional airlift missions between 1972 and 1982. In 1994, testing by the Air Force identified some former spray aircraft as &quot;heavily contaminated&quot; with dioxin residue. Inquiries by aircrew veterans in 2011 brought a decision by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs opining that not enough dioxin residue remained to injure these post-Vietnam War veterans. On 26 January 2012, the U.S. Center For Disease Control's Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry challenged this with their finding that former spray aircraft were indeed contaminated and the aircrews exposed to harmful levels of dioxin. In response to veterans' concerns, the VA in February 2014 referred the C-123 issue to the Institute of Medicine for a special study, with results expected in late 2014.

In 1978, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency suspended spraying of Agent Orange in [[U.S. National Forest|National Forests]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicosia and Swofford, 2004: [http://books.google.com/books?id=5hq2_JFvV0kC&amp;pg=PA446 p. 446]&lt;/ref&gt;

A December 2006 Department of Defense report listed Agent Orange testing, storage, and disposal sites at 32 locations throughout the United States, as well as in Canada, Thailand, Puerto Rico, Korea, and in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;Young, 2006: pp. 5–6&lt;/ref&gt; The Veteran Administration has also acknowledged that Agent Orange was used domestically by U.S. forces in test sites throughout the United States. [[Eglin Air Force Base]] in Florida was one of the primary testing sites throughout the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report on DoD Herbicides Outside of Vietnam|url = http://www.publichealth.va.gov/docs/agentorange/dod_herbicides_outside_vietnam.pdf|author=U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs|accessdate=September 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cleanup programs==
On the 9th of August 2012, the United States and Vietnam began a cooperative cleaning up of the toxic chemical on part of [[Danang International Airport]], marking the first time Washington has been involved in cleaning up Agent Orange in Vietnam. Danang was the primary storage site of the chemical. Two other cleanup sites the United States and Vietnam are looking at is [[Biên Hòa]], in the southern province of [[Đồng Nai Province|Đồng Nai]] - a 'hotspot' for [[dioxin]] - and [[Phù Cát]] airport in the central province of [[Bình Định]], says U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam David Shear. According to the Vietnamese newspaper [[Nhân Dân]], the U.S. government provided $41 million to the project, which will reduce the contamination level in 73,000 m³ of soil by late 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/09/us-vietnam-usa-agentorange-idUSBRE87803K20120809|title=U.S. starts its first Agent Orange cleanup in Vietnam|publisher=Reuters|date=Aug 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
