A '''bikini''' is generally&lt;!-- NOTE: The term &quot;generally&quot; is used because the term &quot;bikini&quot; can also refer to a man's swimsuit.--&gt; a two-piece [[swimsuit]] that comprises panties-style bottoms that cover at least a female's [[crotch]] and a bra-style top that covers at least her [[breast]]s, but which leaves her [[midriff]] exposed, and usually the [[navel]] and [[waist]].&lt;ref name=MMOA/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bikini&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Bikini|publisher=''[[Merriam-Webster]]''|date=February 13, 2014|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bikini}}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of a bikini bottom can range from full pelvic coverage to a revealing [[thong (clothing)|thong]] or [[g-string]] design.

The modern bikini was popularised by French engineer [[Louis Réard]] and separately by fashion designer [[Jacques Heim]] in Paris in 1946. The take up of the style was controversial, and many western countries banned it from beaches and public places, with the [[Holy See|Vatican]] declaring it sinful.&lt;ref name=Alac&gt;{{cite book |last=Alac |first=Patrik |title=Bikini Story |year=2012|publisher=Parkstone International |isbn=9781780429519|edition=first |page=52 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=SIj_GBl5sAoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9zXxU5P2GMaC8gXWl4GQDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bikini was considered risqué but became part of popular culture with [[filmstar]]s like [[Brigitte Bardot]], [[Ursula Andress]] and others wearing them in films. The bikini has become common in most western countries by the mid-1960s, and not only as swimwear.

The original bikini style has developed in popular culture a positive connotation, giving raise to variations of the term being used to describe stylistic variations. These forms are used predominantly for promotional purposes and as an industry classification, but which are not of importance to the general public, and are described as [[Bikini variant|variants of the bikini]]. These variants often use endings such as ''-kini''s and ''-ini''s, such as [[monokini]], [[microkini]], [[tankini]], [[trikini]], pubikini, bandeaukini and skirtini. A man's [[Swim briefs|brief swimsuit]] may also be referred to as a bikini.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bikini&quot;/&gt; A variety of men's and women's underwear are known as bikini underwear. The bikini fueled spin-off industries like [[bikini wax]]ing and [[sun tanning]].&lt;ref name=AgeL&gt;Lorna Edwards, &quot;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2006/06/02/1148956539436.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 You've still got it, babe], ''[[The Age]]'', June 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Villa del Casale - jeu de balle.jpeg|thumb|The ancient Roman [[Villa Romana del Casale]] (286–305 AD) in [[Sicily]] contains one of the earliest known illustrations of a bikini.]]

Swimming or bathing outdoors were discouraged in the [[Christian West]], and so there was little demand or need for swimming or bathing costume until the 18th century. The bathing gown of the 18th century was a loose ankle-length full-sleeve [[chemise]]-type gown made of wool or flannel, so that modesty or decency was not threatened.&lt;ref name=claud&gt;Claudia B. Kidwell, ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/37586/37586-h/37586-h.htm Women's Bathing and Swimming Costume in the United States]'', Smithsonian Institution Press, City of Washington, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, Australian swimmer and performer [[Annette Kellerman]] was arrested on a [[Boston]] beach for wearing a form-fitting sleeveless one-piece knitted swimming tights that covered her from neck to toe, a costume she adopted from England,&lt;ref name=claud/&gt; although it became accepted swimsuit attire for women in parts of Europe by 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Liz Conor, ''The spectacular modern woman: feminine visibility in the 1920s'', page 152, Indiana University Press, 2004, ISBN 0-253-34391-7&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, inspired by the introduction of females into Olympic swimming, the designer [[Carl Jantzen]] made the first functional two-piece swimwear, a close-fitting one-piece with shorts on the bottom and short sleeves on top.&lt;ref name=heritage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/web/20060705-bikini-swimming-suit-louis-reard-micheline-bernardini-paris-brigitte-bardot.shtml|accessdate=13 November 2007|publisher=American Heritage Inc.|title=60 Years of Bikinis|author=Hoover, Elizabeth D.|date=5 July 2006|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070909195749/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/web/20060705-bikini-swimming-suit-louis-reard-micheline-bernardini-paris-brigitte-bardot.shtml |archivedate=9 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1920s and 1930s, people began to shift from &quot;taking in the water&quot; to &quot;taking in the sun,&quot; at bathhouses and spas, and swimsuit designs shifted from functional considerations to incorporate more decorative features. [[Rayon]] was used in the 1920s in the manufacture of tight-fitting swimsuits,&lt;ref name=sydelle&gt;{{cite web|last=Sydelle|first=John|title=The Swimsuit Industry|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/swimsuit-industry-18779.html |work=The Houston Chronicle |accessdate=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its durability, especially when wet, proved problematic;&lt;!-- Rayon also had the lowest elastic recovery of any fiber.--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kadolph&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Textiles|edition=9|author=Kadolph, Sara J. and Langford, Anna L.|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=0-13-025443-6|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jersey (clothing)|jersey]] and [[silk]] were also sometimes used.&lt;ref name=glamoursurf&gt;{{cite web|title=Vintage Swimwear Timeline|url=http://www.glamoursurf.com/swimwear_timeline.html|publisher=Glamoursurf.com|accessdate=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s, manufacturers had lowered necklines in the back, removed sleeves, and tightened the sides. With the development of new clothing materials, particularly [[latex]] and [[nylon]], through the 1930s&lt;!--1934 is too specific a date--&gt; swimsuits gradually began hugging the body, with shoulder straps that could be lowered for tanning.&lt;ref name=carnival&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnaval.com/bikini/#In%20Brazil |title=History of the Bikini |publisher=Carnival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's swimwear of the 1930s and 1940s incorporated increasing degrees of [[midriff exposure]]. Teen magazines of late 1940s and 1950s featured similar designs of midriff-baring suits and tops. However, midriff fashion was stated as only for beaches and informal events and considered indecent to be worn in public.&lt;ref name=&quot;girl&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Claudia Mitchell, Jacqueline Reid-Walsh|title=Girl Culture: Studying girl culture : a readers' guide Volume 1 of Girl Culture: An Encyclopedia|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=&lt;!--0313339090, --&gt;9780313339097|page=702|url=http://books.google.co.in/books?id=arQy0v_PBx4C&amp;pg=PA225&amp;dq=cheerleader+midriff&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_wyAT--XCoTprQeL5NTrBQ&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=midriff&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood endorsed the new glamor in films like ''[[Neptune's Daughter (1949 film)|Neptune's Daughter]]'' in which [[Esther Williams]] wore provocatively named costumes such as &quot;Double Entendre&quot; and &quot;Honey Child&quot;.&lt;ref name=notting&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Sandhu |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/sunandsea/728059/Nottingham-Bathed-in-nostalgia.html |title=Nottingham: Bathed in nostalgia |publisher=The Telegraph |date=August 4, 2003 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For women, wearing a bikini signaled a kind of second liberation. There was really nothing sexual about this. It was instead a celebration of freedom and a return to the joys in life.&quot;&lt;ref name=heritage/&gt;

Heim's ''atome'' was more attuned to the sense of propriety of the 1940s and a bigger hit than Réard's design but Réard's was the design that won the public's imagination over time.&lt;ref name=Gunn /&gt; Both Heim's and Réard's businesses soared in France. According to WordIQ.com, it took fifteen years for Réard's bikini to be accepted in the United States. Though Heim's design was the first worn on the beach and sold more swimsuits, it was Réard's description of the two-piece swimsuit as a ''bikini'' that stuck.{{sfn|Weisgall|1994|pp=264–265}}&lt;ref name=BBCW/&gt; As the style gained world-wide acceptance, the term became a generic or common name for a two-piece swimsuit, instead of the original use as a [[brand name]], and Réard's design became the standard for the two-piece swimsuit.

In Europe, 17-year-old [[Brigitte Bardot]] wore scanty bikinis (by contemporary standards) in the French film ''Manina, la fille sans voiles'' (&quot;Manina, the girl unveiled&quot;). The promotion for the film, released in France in March 1953, drew more attention to Bardot's bikinis than to the film itself. By the time the film was released in the United States in 1958 it was re-titled ''[[Manina, the Girl in the Bikini]]''. Bardot was also photographed wearing a bikini on the beach during the 1953 [[Cannes Film Festival]]. Working with her husband and agent [[Roger Vadim]] she garnered significant attention with photographs of her wearing a bikini on every beach in the south of France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of the Bikini|url=http://www.elle.com/fashion/spotlight/the-history-of-the-bikini-654900#slide-6|publisher=ELLE|date=April 23, 2012 | accessdate=August 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar photographs were taken of [[Anita Ekberg]] and [[Sophia Loren]], among others.

The bikini finally caught on, and by 1963, the movie ''[[Beach Party]]'', starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon, led a wave of films that made the bikini a pop-culture symbol, though Funicello was barred from wearing Réard's bikini unlike the other young females in the films.

Indian women wear bikinis when they vacation abroad or in [[Goa]] without the family. In summer though, when women take up swimming, often in a public space, a lot of tankinis, shorts and single-piece swimsuits are sold.&lt;ref name=HTBikini&gt;&quot;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2617354071.html Are Indian girls bikini ready?]&quot;, Hindustan Times (New Delhi, India), March 25, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum sales for bikinis happen in the winter, the honeymoon season.&lt;ref name=HTBikini/&gt; Women go in breast augmentation and tummy tucks in March and April to get in shape for a bikini.&lt;ref name=HTBikini/&gt;

While the name &quot;bikini&quot; was at first applied only to beachwear that revealed the wearer's navel, today the fashion industry considers any two-piece swimsuit a bikini.&lt;ref name=patton&gt;{{cite web|last=Patton|first=Susan Ruiz|title=A Bikini Isn't The Choice Of Miss Pa.

Bikinis can and have been made out of almost every possible clothing material, and the fabrics and other materials used to make bikinis are an essential element of their design.&lt;ref name=materials&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosebush|first=Judson|title=Materials|url=http://bikiniscience.com/costumes/bikiniology_SS/materials_S/materials.html|publisher=Bikini Science|accessdate=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of cotton makes the swimsuit more practical, and the increased reliance on stretch fabric after 1960 simplified construction. Modern bikinis were first made of cotton and jersey. [[DuPont]]'s introduction of Lycra ([[spandex]]) in the 1960s completely changed how bikinis were designed and worn, as according to Kelly Killoren Bensimon, a former model and author of ''The Bikini Book'', &quot;the advent of Lycra allowed more women to wear a bikini...it didn't sag, it didn't bag, and it concealed and revealed. It wasn't so much like lingerie anymore.&quot;&lt;ref name=sfgate&gt;{{cite news|last=Rubin|first=Sylvia|title=Fashion shocker of '46: the naked belly button / But the bikini wasn't a hit until Sixties|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Fashion-shocker-of-46-the-naked-belly-button-2493673.php|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=August 19, 2013 |date=July 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative swimwear fabrics such as velvet, leather, and crocheted squares surfaced in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=MMOA/&gt;

Beach volleyball became the fifth largest television audience of all the sports at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] at [[Bondi Beach, New South Wales|Bondi Beach]] in Australia owing, it is claimed, to the sex appeal of bikini-clad players as well as their athletic ability.&lt;ref&gt;Stuff Writer, &quot;[http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/summer04/gen/news/story?id=1860176 Beach volleyball a popular spectator sport]&quot;, ''ESPN'', August 16, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Kimberly Bissell conducted a study on the camera angles used during the 2004 Summer Olympic Games beach volleyball games.

During the 1950s to mid-1970s men's contest formats were often supplemented with women's beauty contests or bikini shows. The winners earned titles like Miss Body Beautiful, Miss Physical Fitness and Miss Americana, and also presented trophies to the winners of the men's contest.&lt;ref&gt;Maria R.

==Bikini underwear==
[[File:Male model B and Female model A 01.JPG|thumb|left|Bikini underwear]]

Certain types of underwear worn by both men and women are identified as bikini-style underwear because they are similar in size and form to the bottom half of a bikini bathing suit. For women, bikini underwear can refer to virtually any tight, skimpy, or revealing undergarment that provides less coverage to the midsection than traditional underwear, [[panties]] or knickers. For men, a bikini is a type of undergarment that is smaller and more revealing than men's briefs. Bikini briefs can be low- or high-side bikini briefs but are usually lower than true waist, often at hips, and usually have no access pouch or flap, legs bands at tops of thighs. String bikini briefs have front and rear sections that meet in the crotch but not at the waistband, with no fabric on the side of the legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of Underwear |url=http://www.boxerbriefs.com/history_of_underwear.htm |publisher=Boxerbriefs.com |accessdate=August 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swimwear and underwear have always had close design connections because of their shared proximity to the body; the primary distinguishing feature between them is that swimwear takes underwear to the public view.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Craik, '' The Face of Fashion: Cultural Studies in Fashion'', page 133, Routledge, 1993, ISBN 9781134940561&lt;/ref&gt; The swimsuit was and is closely aligned to underwear in terms of styling,&lt;ref&gt;Christine Schmid, ''The Swimsuit: Fashion from Poolside to Catwalk'', page 6, A&amp;C Black, 2013, ISBN 9780857851246&lt;/ref&gt; and at about the same time that attitudes towards the bikini began to change, underwear underwent a redesign towards a minimal, unboned design that emphasized comfort first.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Parker, ''The Bathing Suit: Christian Liberty Or Secular Idolatry'', page 170, Xulon Press, 2003, ISBN 9781591607533&lt;/ref&gt;

As the swimsuit was evolving, the underwear started to change. Between 1900 to 1940, swimsuit lengths followed the changes in underwear designs.&lt;ref&gt;Muriel Barbier, Shazia Boucher, ''The Story of Lingerie'', page 139, Parkstone International, 2012, ISBN 9781780429700&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s women started discarding the corset, while the Cadole company of Paris started developing something they called the &quot;breast girdle&quot;.&lt;ref name=napol&gt;Anthony Napoleon, ''Awakening Beauty&quot;, page 130, Virtualbookworm Publishing, 2003, ISBN 9781589393783&lt;/ref&gt; During the Great Depression, panties and bras became softly constructed and were made of various elasticized yarns making underwear fit like a second skin. By 1930s underwear styles for both women and men were influenced by the new brief models of swimwear from Europe. Although the waistband was still above the navel, the leg openings of the panty brief were cut in an arc to rise from the crotch to the hip joint. The brief served as a template for most all variations of panties for the rest of the century.&lt;ref name=ddhills&gt;Daniel Delis Hill, '' As Seen in Vogue: A Century of American Fashion in Advertising'', page 158, Texas Tech University Press, 2007, ISBN 9780896726161&lt;/ref&gt; Warner standardized the concept of [[Cup size]] in 1935. The first underwire bra was developed in 1938.&lt;ref name=napol/&gt; Beginning in the late thirties skants, a type of skanty men's briefs, were introduced, featuring very high-cut leg openings and a lower rise to the waistband.&lt;ref name=ddhills/&gt; [[Howard Hughes]] designed the push-up bra worn by [[Jane Russell]] in ''[[The Outlaw]]'' in 1943. In 1950 [[Maidenform]] introduced the first official bust enhancing bra.&lt;ref name=napol/&gt;

By the 1960s, the bikini swimsuit influenced panty styles and coincided with the cut of the new lower rise jeans and pants. In the seventies, with the emergence of skintight jeans, thong versions of the panty became mainstream, since the open, stringed back eliminated any tell-tale panty lines across the rear and hips. By the 1980s the design of the French-cut panty pushed the waistband back up to the natural waistline and the rise of the leg openings was nearly as high (French Cut panties come up to the waist, has a high cut leg, and usually are full in the rear&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Cole, '' Lingerie, the Foundation of a Woman's Life'',  page 45, Choice Publications, 2005, ISBN 9780971180345&lt;/ref&gt;). As with the bra and other type of lingerie, manufacturers of the last quarter of the century marketed panty styles that were designed primarily for their sexual allure.&lt;ref name=ddhills/&gt; This decade marks the sexualization and eroticization of the male body through advertising campaigns for brands such as Calvin Klein, particularly by photographers Bruce Weber and Herb Ritts. Male bodies and men's undergarments were commodified and packaged for mass consumption, and swimwear and sportswear were influenced by sports photography and fitness.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Schmid, ''The Swimsuit: Fashion from Poolside to Catwalk'', page 19, A&amp;C Black, 2013, ISBN 9780857851246&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, swimwear evolved from weighty wool to high-tech [[skin-tight garment]]s, eventually cross-breeding with sportswear, underwear and exercise wear, resulting in the interchangeable fashions of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Schmid, ''The Swimsuit: Fashion from Poolside to Catwalk'', page 102, A&amp;C Black, 2013, ISBN 9780857851246&lt;/ref&gt;

== Men's bikini ==
[[File:Albert Cordina 1 (cropped).jpg|thumbnail|left|Men's bikini]]

The term ''men's bikini'' is used to describe a specific type of [[Swim briefs|men's swimsuit]]. Men's bikinis can have both high or low side panels, string sides or tie sides, and most lack a button or flap front. Unlike swim briefs, bikinis are not designed for drag reduction and generally lack a visible waistband. Suits less than 1.5&amp;nbsp;inches wide at the hips are less common for sporting purposes and are most often worn for recreation, fashion, and [[sun tanning]]. The posing brief standard to [[bodybuilding]] competitions is an example of this style. Male [[punk rock]] musicians have performed on the stage wearing women's bikini briefs.&lt;ref&gt;A. W. Richard Sipe, ''A Secret World'', page 25, Psychology Press, 1990, ISBN 0-87630-585-0&lt;/ref&gt; The 2000 [[Bollywood]] film ''[[Hera Pheri (2000 film)|Hera Pheri]]'' shows men sunbathing in bikinis, who were mistakenly believed to be girls from a distance.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Vanita, ''Queering India'', page 207, Routledge, 2002, ISBN 0-415-92950-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Swimsuits shown in men's wear collections by [[Giorgio Armani]], [[Dolce &amp; Gabbana]] and [[Paul Smith (fashion designer)|Paul Smith]] have tended to be black and snug fitting, throwbacks to the designs of the 1930s and '40s. [[Gianni Versace]]'s ads contain heroic depictions of Miami bathers in contrast to popular, sports-inspired beach wear—bright and baggy Bermudas or boxer shorts. The Greek designer Nikos Apostolopoulos put a different spin on his bathing suits (for both sexes, but with the focus on the male), making them anatomical creations, cut and stitched to outline the body and its sexual characteristics.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite news |first=Suzy |last=Menkes|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7D81430F93BA25754C0A965958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 |title=Runways: Remembrance of Thongs Past|publisher=The New York Times |date=July 18, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male bikini tops, a [[visual gag]], also exist.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Karnasiewicz, [http://www.salon.com/mwt/broadsheet/2006/01/19/mr_saugus/ Here she comes, &quot;Mr. Saugus High School&quot;], Salon.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Bikini waxing is the [[hair removal|epilation]] of [[pubic hair]] in and around the [[pubic region]] (also known as the bikini line), commonly by women, by the use of [[waxing|wax]]. The bikini line delineates the part of a woman's pubic area which would normally be covered by the bottom part of a swimsuit. In the context of waxing, it is generally understood to describe any pubic hair visible beyond the boundaries of a swimsuit.&lt;ref name=Embod1/&gt; With certain styles of women's swimwear, pubic hair may become visible around the [[crotch]] area of a [[swimsuit]].&lt;ref name=Embod1&gt;Heinz Tschachler, Maureen Devine, Michael Draxlbauer; ''The EmBodyment of American Culture''; pp 61–62; LIT Verlag, Berlin-Hamburg-Münster; 2003; ISBN 3-8258-6762-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Visible pubic hair is widely culturally disapproved, considered to be [[Embarrassment|embarrassing]], and often removed.&lt;ref name=Embod1/&gt; With the reduction in the size of swimsuits, especially since the advent of the bikini after 1945, the practice of bikini waxing has also come into vogue.&lt;ref name=Embod1/&gt;

==Bikini tan==
[[File:Tan lines on human female chest.jpg|thumb|left|Tan lines created by a bikini]]
{{main|Sun tanning}}

Wearing a bikini in the sun results in [[Sun tanning|tanning]] of uncovered skin and creates a &quot;[[tan line#Bikini tan|bikini tan]]&quot;. These tan lines separate pale breasts, crotch, and buttocks from otherwise tanned skin.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |title=Tan-Through Fabric Lets Sun Shine In |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60B12F8385F127A93C5A8178BD95F4D8685F9 |last=Taylor |first=Angela |date=October 17, 1969 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Racing stripes&quot; may refer to the portion of a bikini tan line exposed when wearing one-piece swimwear.

[[Rochester, Kent]] chemical engineering company Alpencorp declared a directly tan-through bikini in 1969.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1082764/3/ Scorecard], ''Sports Illustrated'', 1969-09-01&lt;/ref&gt; [[Staffordshire]] swimwear manufacturers [[Kiniki]] introduced a tan-through bikini in 2009 that used stretch adapted micro-pores to let UV light in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/104281/Tan-tastic-bikini-that-lets-rays-shine-through Tan-tastic bikini that lets rays shine through], ''The Express'', 2009-05-30&lt;/ref&gt;

As bikinis leave most of the body exposed to potentially dangerous [[ultraviolet|UVB]] radiation, overexposure or prolonged exposure can cause [[sunburn]] and some forms of [[skin cancer]], as well as other acute and chronic [[Ultraviolet#Harmful effects|health effects]] on the skin, eye, and [[immune system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;menkes&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Health effects of UV radiation | url = http://www.who.int/uv/health/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, [[ultraviolet|UVC]] radiation can cause adverse effects that can be [[mutagenic]] or [[carcinogenic]].&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2011. [http://www.eoearth.org/article/Sunlight?topic=49585 ''Sunlight''. eds. P.saundry &amp; C.Cleveland.
