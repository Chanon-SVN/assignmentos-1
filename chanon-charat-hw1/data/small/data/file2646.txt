Genetically modified maize
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Genetically modified maize''' ([[maize|corn]]) is a [[genetically modified crop]]. Specific maize strains have been [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] to express agriculturally-desirable [[Phenotypic trait|traits]], including resistance to pests and to herbicides. Maize strains with both traits are now in use in multiple countries. GM maize has also caused controversy with respect to possible health effects, impact on other insects and impact on other plants via [[gene flow]]. One strain, called Starlink, was approved only for animal feed in the US, but was found in food, leading to a [[Starlink corn recalls|series of recalls starting in 2000]].

=== Herbicide resistant maize ===
Corn varieties resistant to [[glyphosate]] herbicides were first commercialized in 1996 by [[Monsanto]], and are known as &quot;Roundup Ready Corn&quot;. They tolerate the use of [[Roundup (herbicide)|Roundup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roundup Ready System|url=http://www.monsanto.com/weedmanagement/Pages/roundup-ready-system.aspx|publisher=Monsanto}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bayer CropScience]] developed &quot;Liberty Link Corn&quot; that is resistant to [[glufosinate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bayercropscience.us/products/herbicides/liberty/|title=Bayer LibertyLink official website|publisher=Bayer Crop Science|accessdate=28 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pioneer Hi-Bred]] has developed and markets corn hybrids with tolerance to [[imidazoline]] herbicides under the trademark &quot;Clearfield&quot; - though in these hybrids, the herbicide-tolerance trait was bred using tissue culture selection and the chemical mutagen ethyl methanesulfonate not [[genetic engineering]].&lt;ref name=&quot;imidcorn&quot; &gt;{{Cite doi|10.1002/ps.993|noedit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the regulatory framework governing the approval of transgenic crops does not apply for Clearfield.&lt;ref name=&quot;imidcorn&quot; /&gt;

The Bt protein is expressed throughout the plant. When a vulnerable insect eats the Bt-containing plant, the protein is activated in its [[gut (anatomy)|gut]], which is [[alkaline]] (the human gut is acidic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fallingborg J. |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10421978 |title=Intraluminal pH of the human gastrointestinal tract [Dan Med Bull. 1999&amp;#93; - PubMed - NCBI |publisher=Ncbi.nlm.nih.gov |date=2014-01-24 |accessdate=2014-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Products in development ==
In 2007, South African researchers announced the production of transgenic maize resistant to [[maize streak virus]] (MSV), although it has not been released as a product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Shepherd DN, Mangwende T, Martin DP, et al. |title=Maize streak virus-resistant transgenic maize: a first for Africa |journal=Plant Biotechnol.

== Refuges ==
US [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) regulations require farmers who plant Bt corn to plant non-Bt corn nearby (called a &quot;refuge&quot;) to provide a location to harbor vulnerable [[Maize#Pests|pests]].&lt;ref name=Witowski&gt;{{cite report|author=J.F. Witkowski|coauthors=J.L. Wedberg, K.L.

The theory behind these refuges is to slow the evolution of resistance to the pesticide. EPA regulations also require seed companies to train farmers how to maintain refuges, to collect data on the refuges and to report that data to the EPA.&lt;ref name=Witowski/&gt; A study of these reports found that from 2003 to 2005 farmer compliance with keeping refuges was above 90%, but that by 2008 approximately 25% of Bt corn farmers did not keep refuges properly, raising concerns that resistance would develop.&lt;ref name=Witowski/&gt;

Unmodified crops received most of the economic benefits of Bt corn in the US in 1996-2007, because of the overall reduction of pest populations. This reduction came because females laid eggs on modified and unmodified strains alike.&lt;ref name=sci1009/&gt;

Critics have objected to GM crops on ecological, economic and health grounds. The economic issues derive from those organisms that are subject to intellectual property law, mostly patents. The first generation of GM crops lose patent protection beginning in 2015.

As a toxic mechanism, ''cry'' proteins bind to specific receptors on the membranes of mid-gut ([[epithelial]]) cells, resulting in rupture of those cells. Any organism that lacks the appropriate gut receptors cannot be affected by the ''cry'' protein, and therefore Bt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bt corn: is it worth the risk?|url=http://www.scq.ubc.ca/bt-corn-is-it-worth-the-risk/|last1=Hall|first1=H.|publisher=The Science Creative Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dorsch, J.A. et al.

[[Gene flow]] is the transfer of genes and/or alleles from one species to another. Concerns focus on the interaction between GM and other maize varieties in Mexico, and of gene flow into refuges.

In 2009 the government of Mexico created a regulatory pathway for genetically modified maize,&lt;ref&gt;GMO Compass. 5 June 2009 [http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/news/447.mexico_controlled_cultivation_genetically_modified_maize.html Mexico: controlled cultivation of genetically modified maize]&lt;/ref&gt; but because Mexico is the [[center of diversity]] for maize, gene flow could affect a large fraction of the world's maize strains.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Shanahan for Science and Development Network, 10 November 2004.

=== Food ===
The French High Council of Biotechnologies Scientific Committee reviewed the 2009 Vendômois ''et al.'' study and concluded that it &quot;..presents no admissible scientific element likely to ascribe any haematological, hepatic or renal toxicity to the three re-analysed GMOs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=Opinion relating to the deposition of 15 December 2009 by the Member of Parliament, François Grosdidier, as to the conclusions of the study entitled &quot;A comparison of the effects of three GM corn varieties on mammalian health&quot; by J.

A 2011 Canadian study looked at the presence of CryAb1 protein (BT toxin) in non-pregnant women, pregnant women and fetal blood.

=== Starlink corn recalls ===
{{main|Starlink corn recall}}

StarLink contains Cry9C, which had not previously been used in a GM crop.&lt;ref name=ColStateExt-Starlink&gt;Department of Soil and Crop Sciences at Colorado State University, Page last updated March 11, 2004 [http://cls.casa.colostate.edu/transgeniccrops/hotstarlink.html StarLink Corn]&lt;/ref&gt; Starlink's creator, [[Plant Genetic Systems]] had applied to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to market Starlink for use in animal feed and in human food.&lt;ref name=Pew&gt;Michael R. Taylor and Jody S. Tick of Resources for the Future, Pew Initiative on Food and Biotechnology. [http://www.pewtrusts.org/uploadedFiles/wwwpewtrustsorg/Reports/Food_and_Biotechnology/hhs_biotech_star_case.pdf The StarLink Case: Issues for the Future]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}} However, because the Cry9C protein lasts longer in the digestive system than other Bt proteins, the EPA had concerns about its allergenicity, and PGS did not provide sufficient data to prove that Cry9C was not allergenic.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;While EPA had no specific data to indicate that Cry9C was an allergen, the protein expressed in StarLink corn did exhibit certain characteristics (i.e. relative heat stability and extended time to digestion) that were common to known food allergens such as those found in peanuts, eggs, etc. EPA’s concern was that StarLink corn may be a human food allergen and in the absence of more definitive data, EPA has not made a decision whether or not to register the human food use.&quot; Staff, EPA. November 2000 [http://www.epa.gov/scipoly/sap/meetings/2000/november/prelim_eval_sub102500.pdf Executive Summary: EPA Preliminary Evaluation of Information Contained in the October 25, 2000 Submission from Aventis Cropscience]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} As a result PGS split its application into separate permits for use in food and use in [[compound feed|animal feed]].&lt;ref name=ColStateExt-Starlink/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-1997-11-26/pdf/97-31131.pdf Plant Genetic Systems (America) Inc.: PP 7G4921] Federal Register Vol. 62, No. 228, November 26, 1997 pp 63169 bottom of middle column - 63170 right column; see especially p63169 top of right column&lt;/ref&gt; Starlink was approved by the EPA for use in animal feed only in May 1998.&lt;ref name=Pew/&gt;{{rp|15}}

StarLink corn was subsequently found in food destined for consumption by humans in the US, Japan, and South Korea.&lt;ref name=Pew/&gt;{{rp|20–21}} This corn became the subject of the widely publicized [[Starlink corn recall]], which started when [[Taco Bell]]-branded taco shells sold in supermarkets were found to contain the corn. Sales of StarLink seed were discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;King D, Gordon A. [http://www.foe.org/act/getacobellpr.html Contaminant found in Taco Bell taco shells.

Fifty-one people reported adverse effects to the FDA; [[US Centers for Disease Control]] (CDC), which determined that 28 of them were possibly related to Starlink.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, EPA review committee. [http://www.usda.gov/documents/LLP%20Incidents%202.docx LLP Incidents]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the CDC studied the blood of these 28 individuals and concluded there was no evidence of hypersensitivity to the Starlink Bt protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehhe/Cry9cReport/default.htm|title=CDC, National Center for Environmental Health.

A subsequent review of these tests by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act Scientific Advisory Panel points out that while &quot;the negative results decrease the probability that the Cry9C protein is the cause of allergic symptoms in the individuals examined ... in the absence of a positive control and questions regarding the sensitivity and specificity of the assay, it is not possible to assign a negative predictive value to this.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/scipoly/SAP/meetings/2001/july/julyfinal.pdf FIFRA Scientific Advisory Panel Report No. 2001-09, July 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, aid sent by the UN and the US to Central American nations also contained some StarLink corn.
