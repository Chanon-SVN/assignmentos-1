Romantic orientation
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Sexual orientation}}
'''Romantic orientation''', also called '''affectional orientation''', indicates the [[sex]] or [[gender]] with which a person is most likely to have a [[romance (love)|romantic relationship]] or [[Falling in love|fall in love]]. It is used both alternatively and side-by-side with the term ''[[sexual orientation]]'', and is based on the perspective that [[sexual attraction]] is but a single component of a larger dynamic.&lt;ref&gt;Crethar, H. C. &amp; Vargas, L. A. (2007). ''Multicultural intricacies in professional counseling.'' In J. Gregoire &amp; C. Jungers (Eds.), The counselor’s companion: What every beginning counselor needs to know. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. ISBN 0-8058-5684-6. p.61.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, although a [[pansexuality|pansexual]] person may feel sexually attracted to multiple genders, they may be predisposed to romantic intimacy with females. Moreover, [[Emotional intimacy|emotional]] or romantic intimacy between partners does not require sexual attraction because attraction is not purely sexual. 

For some people {{who|date=January 2015}}, the term ''sexual orientation'' is reductionistic. For [[Asexuality|asexual]] people, romantic orientation is often considered a more useful measure of attraction than sexual orientation.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
