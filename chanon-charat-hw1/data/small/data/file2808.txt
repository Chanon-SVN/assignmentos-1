'''Brasília''' ({{IPA-pt|bɾaˈziljɐ}}) is the [[federal capital]] of [[Brazil]] and the [[seat]] of [[government]] of the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]]. The city is located along the [[Brazilian Highlands]] in the country's [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-West]] region. It was founded on April 21, 1960, to serve as the new national capital.  Brasília, easily the fastest growing major city in the country, had an estimated population of 2,852,372 in 2014, just 50,000 residents shy of Salvador, placing it as the [[List of largest cities in Brazil|4th most populous city]] in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibge.gov.br/estadosat/perfil.php?sigla=df IBGE: Brasília] [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]. Retrieved on 2014-09-07. {{pt icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among major Latin American cities, Brasília has the highest GDP per capita at R$61,915 (US$36,175).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.urosario.edu.co/urosario_files/9d/9d96f884-d433-45a8-947b-4e9877596f63.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Istrate |first=Emilia |url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/global-metro-monitor-3 |title=Global MetroMonitor &amp;#124; Brookings Institution |publisher=Brookings.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brasília was planned and developed by [[Lúcio Costa]] and [[Oscar Niemeyer]] in 1956 in order to move the capital from [[Rio de Janeiro]] to a more central location. The landscape architect was [[Roberto Burle Marx]]. The city's design divides it into numbered blocks as well as sectors for specified activities, such as the Hotel Sector, the Banking Sector and the Embassy Sector. Brasília was chosen as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] due to its [[modernist architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/445|title=World Heritage List|publisher=Unesco|accessdate=February 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has a unique status in Brazil, as it is an administrative division rather than a legal municipality like other [[List of cities in Brazil|cities in Brazil]]. Nationally, the term is almost always used synonymously with the Federal District, which constitutes an indivisible [[Federative Unit]]. Several satellite cities are also part of the Federal District.

The centers of all three branches of the [[federal government of Brazil]] are in Brasília, including the [[National Congress of Brazil|Congress]], [[President of Brazil|President]], and [[Supreme Federal Tribunal|Supreme Court]]. The city also hosts 124 foreign [[embassies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.mre.gov.br/cerimonial|title=Lista do Corpo Diplomático e Organismos Internacionais|publisher=Cerimonial, Ministério das Relações Exteriores|accessdate=August 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brasília International Airport]] connects the capital to all major Brazilian cities and many international destinations, and is the [[List of the busiest airports in Brazil|third busiest airport in Brazil]].

The city was one of the main host cities of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. Additionally, Brasília hosted the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Brasília|Timeline of Brasília|History of Brazil}}
[[File:Brasilia - Plan.JPG|thumb|left|The Pilot Plan]]
From 1763 to 1960, [[Rio de Janeiro]] was the capital of Brazil. At this time, resources tended to be centered in Brazil's southeast region near Rio de Janeiro. Brasília's geographically central location fostered a more regionally neutral federal capital. An article of the country's first [[Brazilian Constitution of 1891|republican constitution]] dating back to 1891 stated that the capital should be moved from Rio de Janeiro to a place close to the center of the country. The plan was originally conceived in 1827 by [[José Bonifácio]], an advisor to Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]]. He presented a plan to the [[Empire of Brazil#Parliament|General Assembly of Brazil]] for a new city called Brasília, with the idea of moving the capital westward from the heavily populated southeastern corridor. The bill was not enacted because Pedro I dissolved the Assembly.

[[Juscelino Kubitschek]], [[President of Brazil]] from 1956 to 1961, ordered the construction of Brasília, fulfilling the promise of the Constitution and his own political campaign promise. Building Brasília was part of Juscelino's &quot;fifty years of prosperity in five&quot; plan. [[Lúcio Costa]] won a contest and was the main urban planner in 1957, with 5550 people competing. [[Oscar Niemeyer]], a close friend, was the chief architect of most public buildings and [[Roberto Burle Marx]] was the [[landscape architecture|landscape designer]]. Brasília was built in 41 months, from 1956 to April 21, 1960, when it was officially inaugurated.

Until the 1980s, the governor of the Federal District was appointed by the Federal Government, and the laws of Brasília were issued by the Brazilian Federal Senate. With the Constitution of 1988 Brasília gained the right to elect its [[Governor]], and a [[District Assembly]] (Câmara Legislativa) was elected to exercise [[legislative power]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aboutbrasilia.com/facts/history.php History of Brasília] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal District does not have a Judicial Power of its own. The Judicial Power which serves the Federal District also serves federal territories. Currently, Brazil does not have any territories, therefore, for now the courts serve only cases from the Federal District.

According to legend, [[Italy|Italian]] saint [[John Bosco|Don Bosco]] in 1883 had a dream in which he described a futuristic city that roughly fitted Brasília's location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santuariodombosco.org.br/bosco.asp |title=São João Bosco |language=Portuguese |work=Don Bosco Sanctuary website |accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Brasília today, many references of Bosco, who founded the [[Salesian]] order, are found throughout the city and one church parish in the city bears his name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brazil-travel-northeast.com/brasilia-brazil.html About Brasilia Brazil] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
{{See also|Climate of Brazil}}
Brasília has a [[tropical savanna climate|tropical savanna climate (Aw)]] according to the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen system]], with two distinct seasons: the [[rainy season]], from October to April, and a [[dry season]], from May to September.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:IMvJ9mq5wGUJ:stat.correioweb.com.br/cbonline/2010_04/50anos/bsb14-2104.pdf+&amp;cd=3&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=br A cidade das duas estações] (in Brazilian Portuguese).&lt;/ref&gt; The average temperature is {{convert|20.6|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.

[[File:Brasília from space.jpg|thumb|Brasília at night from [[International Space Station|ISS]].]]
According to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|2010 IBGE Census]], there were 2,469,489 people residing in the city of Brasília.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.censo2010.ibge.gov.br/dados_divulgados/index.php?uf=33 2010 IGBE Census] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The census revealed the following numbers: 1,239,882 [[Pardo]] ([[Multiracial#Brazil|Multiracial]]) people (48.2%), 1,084,418 [[White Brazilian|White]] people (42.2%), 198,072 [[Afro-Brazilian|Black]] people (7.7%), 41,522 [[Asian Brazilian|Asian]] people (1.6%), 6,128 [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindian]] people (0.2%).&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.censo2010.ibge.gov.br/painel/?nivel=mn 2010 IGBE Census] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Brasília was ranked as the fourth most populous city in [[Brazil]] after [[São Paulo]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], and [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2010/11/04/maiores-cidades-do-brasil-crescem-menos-do-que-resto-do-pais-aponta-censo.jhtm The largest Brazilian cities - 2010 IBGE Census }] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the city had 474,871 [[Marriage|opposite-sex couples]] and 1,241 [[same-sex couple]]s (see more at [[LGBT rights in Brazil]]). The population of Brasília was 52.2% [[female]] and 47.8% [[male]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3/&gt;

In the 1960 census there were almost 140,000 residents in the new Federal District. By 1970 this figure had grown to more than 537,000. In 2000 the population of the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]] was over 2,000,000. Planned for only 500,000 inhabitants, Brasília has seen its population grow much more than expected. Several satellite cities have been created over the years to house the extra inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/~augusto_areal/bsb_aug1.htm |title=Population of Brasília |publisher=Geocities.com |date=January 17, 2007 |accessdate=April 17, 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/~augusto_areal/bsb_aug1.htm&amp;date=2009-10-26+00:42:12|archivedate=October 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning, the growth of Brasília was greater than original estimates. According to the original plans, Brasília would be a city for government authorities and staff. However, during the construction period, Brazilians from all over the country migrated to Brasília, seeking public and private jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutbrasilia.com/facts/history.html |title=Immigration to Brasília |publisher=Aboutbrasilia.com |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the close of the 20th century, Brasília held the distinction of being the largest city in the world which had not existed at the beginning of the century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://salebatterymart.over-blog.com/article-brasilia-and-asuncion-110994606.html Brasília in the World] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brasília has one of the highest population growth rates in Brazil, with annual growth of 2.82%, mostly because of internal migration.

Brasília's inhabitants include a foreign population of mostly embassy workers as well as large numbers of Brazilian migrants. Today, the city has important communities of immigrants and refugees. The [[Human Development Index]] in the city is at 0.936 in the year 2000 ([[developed country|developed nation]] level), and the illiteracy rate is around 4.35%.

==Cityscape==
[[File:BrasiliaBanNacional.jpg|thumb|Brazilian Flag and National Congress in spring]]

At the northwestern end of the [[Monumental Axis]] are federal district and municipal buildings, while at the southeastern end, near the middle shore of Lake Paranoá, stand the executive, judicial, and legislative buildings around the Square of Three Powers, the conceptual heart of the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/77841/Brasilia Brasília] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These and other major structures were designed by Brazilian architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]]. In the Square of Three Powers, he created as a focal point the dramatic Congressional Palace, which is composed of five parts: twin administrative towers flanked by a large, white concrete dome (the meeting place of the Senate) and by an equally massive concrete bowl (the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil|Chamber of Deputies]]), which is joined to the dome by an underlying, flat-roofed building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tripbucket.com/dreams/dream/visit-brasilia-brazil-unesco-site/ Brasília, Brazil (UNESCO site)] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of low-lying annexes (largely hidden) flank both ends. Also in the square are the glass-faced [[Planalto Palace]] housing the presidential offices, and the Palace of the Supreme Court. Farther east, on a triangle of land jutting into the lake, is the Palace of the Dawn (Palácio da Alvorada; the presidential residence). Between the federal and civic buildings on the Monumental Axis is the city's cathedral, considered by many to be Niemeyer's finest achievement (see photographs of the interior). The parabolically shaped structure is characterized by its 16 gracefully curving supports, which join in a circle 115 feet (35 meters) above the floor of the nave; stretched between the supports are translucent walls of tinted glass. The nave is entered via a subterranean passage rather than conventional doorways. Other notable buildings are Buriti Palace, [[Itamaraty Palace]], the National Theater, and several foreign embassies that creatively embody features of their national architecture. The Brazilian landscape architect [[Roberto Burle Marx]] designed landmark modernist gardens for some of the principal buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlesayoub.com/life-style/index.php/more/1/5157 Brasília] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both low-cost and luxury housing were built by the government in the Brasília. The residential zones of the inner city are arranged into ''superquadras'' (&quot;superblocks&quot;): groups of apartment buildings along with a prescribed number and type of schools, retail stores, and open spaces. At the northern end of Lake Paranoá, separated from the inner city, is a peninsula with many fashionable homes, and a similar city exists on the southern lakeshore. Originally the city planners envisioned extensive public areas along the shores of the [[Reservoir|artificial lake]], but during early development private clubs, hotels, and upscale residences and restaurants gained footholds around the water. Set well apart from the city are [[Satellite town|satellite cities]], including [[Gama, Federal District|Gama]], [[Ceilândia]], [[Taguatinga, Federal District|Taguatinga]], Núcleo Bandeirante, [[Sobradinho, Federal District|Sobradinho]], and [[Planaltina, Federal District|Planaltina]]. These cities, with the exception of Gama and Sobradinho were not planned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conceptical.com/Bras%C3%ADlia Brasília] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monumental civic scale===
[[File:Vista aérea do final da Asa Sul.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the South Wing (''Asa Sul'') district.]]
The city has been both acclaimed and criticized for its use of [[modern architecture|modernist architecture]] on a grand scale and for its somewhat [[utopia]]n city plan.&lt;ref name=&quot;global.britannica.com&quot;&gt;[http://global.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/77841/Brasilia Brasília - Britannica {{en icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

After a visit to Brasília, the French writer [[Simone de Beauvoir]] complained that all of its ''superquadras'' exuded &quot;the same air of elegant monotony,&quot; and other observers have equated the city's large open lawns, plazas, and fields to wastelands. As the city has matured, some of these have gained adornments, and many have been improved by landscaping, giving some observers a sense of &quot;humanized&quot; spaciousness. Although not fully accomplished, the &quot;Brasília utopia&quot; has produced a city of relatively high quality of life, in which the citizens live in forested areas with sporting and leisure structure (the ''superquadras'') flanked by small commercial areas, bookstores and cafes; the city is famous for its cuisine and efficiency of transit.&lt;ref name=&quot;global.britannica.com&quot;/&gt;

Even these positive features have sparked controversy, expressed in the nickname &quot;ilha da fantasia&quot; (&quot;fantasy island&quot;), indicating the sharp contrast between the city and surrounding regions, marked by poverty and disorganization in the cities of the state of [[Goiás]], around Brasília.&lt;ref name=&quot;global.britannica.com&quot;/&gt;

Critics of Brasília's grand scale have characterized it as a modernist platonic fantasy about the future:

{{Quotation|Nothing dates faster than people's fantasies about the future. This is what you get when perfectly decent, intelligent, and talented men start thinking in terms of space rather than place; and single rather than multiple meanings. It's what you get when you design for political aspirations rather than real human needs. You get miles of jerry-built platonic nowhere infested with [[Volkswagen]]s. This, one may fervently hope, is the last experiment of its kind. The utopian buck stops here.|[[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]]|[[The Shock of the New|The Shock of the New, Episode 4: Trouble in Utopia]], (1980)}}

[[File:Empty streets in Brasilia during Brazil &amp; North Korea match at World Cup 2010-06-15 3.jpg|thumb|right|Shopping center in the city.]]

The major roles of construction and of services (government, communications, banking and finance, food production, entertainment, and legal services) in Brasília's economy reflect the city's status as a governmental rather than an industrial center. Industries connected with construction, food processing, and furnishings are important, as are those associated with publishing, printing, and computer software. GDP is divided in Public Administration 54.8%, Services 28.7%, Industry 10.2%, Commerce 6.1%, Agribusiness 0.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdf.df.gov.br/045/04501022.asp |title=GDP – Division – Federal District |publisher=Gdf.df.gov.br |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides being the political center, Brasília is an important economic center. Brasília has the highest city gross domestic product (GDP) of 99.5&amp;nbsp;billion reais representing 3.76% of the total Brazilian GDP.
The main economic activity of the federal capital results from its administrative function. Its industrial planning is studied carefully by the Government of the Federal District. Being a city registered by UNESCO, the government in Brasília has opted to encourage the development of non-polluting industries such as software, film, video, and gemology among others, with emphasis on environmental preservation and maintaining ecological balance, preserving the city property.

According to [[Mercer (consulting firm)|Mercer]]'s [[List of most expensive cities for expatriate employees#Mercer surveys|city rankings of cost of living for expatriate employees]], Brasília ranks 45th among the most expensive cities in the world in 2012, up from the 70th position in 2010, ranking behind [[São Paulo]] (12th) and [[Rio de Janeiro]] (13th).

[[File:Brasilia aerea eixo monumental.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Monumental Axis]].]]

===Historic sites and museums===

====Eixo Monumental====
At the end of the ''[[Monumental Axis|Eixo Monumental]]'' (&quot;Monumental Axis&quot;) lies the ''Esplanada dos Ministérios'' (&quot;Ministries Esplanade&quot;), an open area in downtown Brasília. The rectangular lawn is surrounded by two eight-lane avenues where many government buildings, monuments and memorials are located.

====National Congress====
[[File:Congresso Nacional.jpg|right|thumb|[[National Congress of Brazil|The National Congress]] Building.]]
[[File:Palacio Alvorada commons.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Palácio da Alvorada]].]]

Brazil's [[bicameralism|bicameral]] [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] consists of the [[Senate of Brazil|Senate]] (the upper house) and the [[Chamber of Deputies of Brazil]] (the lower house). Since the 1960s, the National Congress has been located in Brasília. As with most official buildings throughout the city, it was designed by [[Oscar Niemeyer]] in the style of modern Brazilian architecture. The hemisphere to the left is the seat of the Senate and the hemisphere to the right is the seat of the Chamber of Deputies. The Congress also occupies various other surrounding buildings, some connected by tunnels.

The National Congress building is located in the middle of the [[Monumental Axis|Eixo Monumental]], the city's main avenue. In front lies a large lawn and reflecting pool. The building faces the [[Praça dos Três Poderes]] where the [[Palácio do Planalto]] and the [[Supremo Tribunal Federal]] are located.

====Palácio da Alvorada====
The [[Palácio da Alvorada]] is the official residence of the [[President of Brazil]]. The palace was designed, along with the rest of the city of Brasília, by [[Oscar Niemeyer]] and inaugurated in 1958.

One of the first structures built in the republic's new capital city, the &quot;Alvorada&quot; lies on a peninsula at the margins of [[Lake Paranoá]]. The principles of simplicity and modernity, that in the past characterized the great works of architecture, motivated Niemeyer. The viewer has an impression of looking at a glass box, softly landed on the ground with the support of thin external columns.

The building has an area of 7,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with three floors consisting of the basement, landing, and second floor. The auditorium, kitchen, laundry, medical center, and administration offices are at basement level. The rooms used by the presidency for official receptions are on the landing. The second floor has four suites, two apartments, and various private rooms which make up the residential part of the palace.

The building also has a library, a heated Olympic-sized swimming pool, a music room, two dining rooms and various meeting rooms. A chapel and heliport are in adjacent buildings.

====Palácio do Planalto====
[[File:Palacio do Planalto.jpeg|thumb|right|The [[Palácio do Planalto]].]]

The [[Palácio do Planalto]] is the official workplace of the [[President of Brazil]]. It is located at the [[Praça dos Três Poderes]] in Brasília. As the [[Politics of Brazil|seat of government]], the term &quot;O Planalto&quot; is often used as a [[metonym]] for the executive branch of government.

The main working office of the President of the Republic is in the Palácio do Planalto. The President and his or her family do not live in it, rather in the official residence, the [[Palácio da Alvorada]]. Besides the President, senior advisors also have offices in the &quot;Planalto,&quot; including the [[Vice-President of Brazil]] and the [[Chief of Staff of Brazil|Chief of Staff]]. The other Ministries are along the [[Monumental Axis|Esplanada dos Ministérios]].

The architect of the Palácio do Planalto was [[Oscar Niemeyer]], creator of most of the important buildings in Brasília. The idea was to project an image of simplicity and modernity using fine lines and waves to compose the columns and exterior structures.

The Palace is four stories high, and has an area of 36,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Four other adjacent buildings are also part of the complex.
[[File:Itamaraty.jpg|thumb|right|[[Itamaraty Palace]], headquarters of the [[Ministry of External Relations (Brazil)|Ministry of External Relations]].]]

====Complexo Cultural da República====
The [[Cultural Complex of the Republic|Complexo Cultural da República]] (Portuguese for Cultural Complex of the Republic) is formed by the [[National library|National Library]] of Brasília and the National Museum of the Republic. It is situated in the Eixo Monumental, next to the Cathedral of Brasília.

The National Library of Brasília (''Biblioteca Nacional de Brasília'' in Portuguese) occupies an area of 14,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, consisting of reading and study rooms, auditorium and a collection of over 300,000 items.

The National Museum of the Republic (''Museu Nacional da República'' in Portuguese) consists of a 14,500&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; exhibit area, two 780-seat auditoriums, and a laboratory. The space is mainly used to display temporary art exhibits.

===Paranoá Lake===
[[Paranoá Lake]] is a large artificial lake built to increase the amount of water available to the region. It has the second largest marina in Brazil, and hosts wakeboarders and windsurfers.

===Juscelino Kubitschek bridge===
[[File:JK bridge Brasilia lights.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Juscelino Kubitschek bridge|Juscelino Kubitschek Bridge]].]]
The [[Juscelino Kubitschek bridge]], also known as the 'President JK Bridge' or the 'JK Bridge', crosses [[Lake Paranoá]] in Brasília. It is named after [[Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira]], former [[president of Brazil]]. It was designed by architect [[Alexandre Chan]] and [[structural engineer]] Mário Vila Verde. Chan won the [[Gustav Lindenthal]] Medal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eswp.com/bridge/awards.htm |title=Bridge Awards |publisher=Eswp.com |accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; for this project at the 2003 International Bridge Conference in [[Pittsburgh]] due to &quot;...outstanding achievement demonstrating harmony with the environment, aesthetic merit and successful community participation&quot;.

It consists of three {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall asymmetrical steel arches that crisscross diagonally. With a length of 1,200&amp;nbsp;m (0.75 miles), it was completed in 2002 at a cost of US$56.8&amp;nbsp;million. The bridge has a pedestrian walkway and is accessible to bicyclists and skaters.

===Praça dos Três Poderes===
[[File:Supremo Brasil.jpg|thumb|right|[[Supreme Federal Court (Brazil)|Supreme Court of Brazil]].]]
''[[Praça dos Três Poderes]]'' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''Square of the Three Powers'') is a plaza in Brasília. The name is derived from the encounter of the three federal branches around the plaza: the Executive, represented by the [[Palácio do Planalto]] (presidential office); the [[Legislature|Legislative]], represented by the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] (Congresso Nacional); and the Judicial branch, represented by the [[Supreme Federal Court (Brazil)|Supreme Federal Court]] (Supremo Tribunal Federal).

It is a tourist attraction in Brasília, designed by [[Lucio Costa|Lúcio Costa]] and [[Oscar Niemeyer]] as a place where the three branches would meet harmoniously.

===Cathedral of Brasília===
The [[Cathedral of Brasília]] in the capital of the Federative Republic of Brazil, is an expression of the architect [[Oscar Niemeyer]]. This concrete-framed [[hyperboloid structure]], seems with its glass roof reaching up, open, to the heavens. On 31 May 1970, the Cathedral’s structure was finished, and only the {{convert|70|m|2|abbr=on}} diameter of the circular area were visible. Niemeyer's project of Cathedral of Brasília is based in the [[hyperboloid]] of revolution which sections are asymmetric. The hyperboloid structure itself is a result of 16 identical assembled concrete columns. These columns, having hyperbolic section and weighing 90 t, represent two hands moving upwards to heaven. The Cathedral was dedicated on 31 May 1970.

===Popular culture===
[[File:Dom Bosco Brasilia.jpg|right|thumb|Dom Bosco Sanctuary in Brasília.]]
Brasília has also been the focus of modern day literature. Published in 2008, ''The World In Grey: Dom Bosco's Prophecy'', by author Ryan J. Lucero, tells an apocalyptic story based on the famous prophecy from the late 19th century by the Italian saint [[John Bosco|Don Bosco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infobrasilia.com.br/bsb_h1p.htm |title=Dom Bosco – Brasília |publisher=Infobrasilia.com.br |date=April 21, 1965 |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Don Bosco's prophecy:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/ginasant/3383018251/ |title=Dom Bosco – Brasília |publisher=Flickr.com |date=March 24, 2009 |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Between parallels [[15th parallel south|15]] and [[20th parallel south|20]], around a lake which shall be formed; A great civilization will thrive, and that will be the Promised Land.}}

Brasília lies between the parallels 15° S and 20° S, where an artificial lake ([[Lake Paranoá|Paranoá Lake]]) was formed. Don Bosco is Brasília's [[patron saint]].

''[[American Flagg!]]'', the [[First Comics]] comic book series created by [[Howard Chaykin]], portrays Brasília as a cosmopolitan world capital of culture and exotic romance. In the series, it is a top vacation and party destination.

==Transportation==

===International airport===
[[File:Brasilia aeroportojk inauguracaoalasul.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brasília International Airport|Brasília International Airport (BSB)]].]]
[[Brasília International Airport|Brasília–Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek International Airport]] serves the metropolitan area with major domestic and international flights. It is the third busiest [[Brazil]]ian airport based on passengers and aircraft movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;pax&quot;/&gt; Because of its strategic location it is a civil aviation hub for the rest of the country.

This makes for a large number of takeoffs and landings and it is not unusual for flights to be delayed in the holding pattern before landing. Following the airport's master plan, [[Infraero]] built a second runway, which was finished in 2006. In 2007, the airport handled 11,119,872 passengers.&lt;ref name=&quot;pax&quot;&gt;Airport Statistics for 2007 http://www.infraero.gov.br/upload/arquivos/movi/mov.operac.1207.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The main building's third floor, with 12 thousand square meters, has a panoramic deck, a food court, shops, four movie theatres with total capacity of 500 people, and space for exhibitions. Brasília Airport has 136 vendor spaces. The airport is located about {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the central area of Brasília, outside the metro system. The area outside the airport's main gate is lined with taxis as well as several bus line services which connect the airport to Brasília's central district. The parking lot accommodates 1,200 cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutbrasilia.com/travel/airport.html |title=Brasilia International Airport – facts |publisher=Aboutbrasilia.com |date=January 4, 2007 |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airport is serviced by domestic and regional airlines (TAM, GOL, Azul, WebJET, Trip and Avianca), in addition to a number of international carriers. In 2012, Brasília's International Airport was won by the InfrAmerica consortium, formed by the Brazilian engineering company ENGEVIX and the Argentine Corporacion America holding company, with a 50% stake each.&lt;ref&gt;[http://export.gov/brazil/build/groups/public/@eg_br/documents/webcontent/eg_br_063331.pdf Brazilian Airport Privatization – Second Round Concessions] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 25-year concession, the airport may be expanded to up to 40 million passengers a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304311204579506002107709102 Brazil Opens First Expansion at a Privately Operated Airport] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the airport received 15 new boarding bridges, totalling 28 in all. This was the main requirement made by the federal government, which transferred the operation of the terminal to the Inframerica Group after an auction.  The group invested R$750 million in the project. In the same year, the number of [[parking]] spaces doubled, reaching three thousand. The airport's entrance have a new rooftop cover and a new access road. Furthermore, a [[VIP room]] was created on Terminal 1's third floor. The investments resulted an increase the capacity of Brasília's airport from approximately 15 million passengers per year to 21 million by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.copa2014.gov.br/en/noticia/inframerica-group-will-invest-r-750-million-brasilias-airport-world-cup Inframerica Group will invest R$ 750 million in Brasilia’s Airport] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brasília has direct flights to all [[states of Brazil]] and direct [[international flight]]s to [[Atlanta]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Lisbon]], [[Miami]], [[Panama City]], and [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsb.aero/en/cias-aereas/ International flights - Brasília International Airport] {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxis===
Like most Brazilian cities, Brasilia has a good network of taxi companies.  Taxis from the airport are available immediately outside the terminal, but at times there can be quite a queue of people.  Although the airport is not far from the downtown area, taxi prices do seem to be higher than in other Brazilian cities.  Booking in advance can be advantageous, particularly if time is limited, and companies such as [http://www.brazilairporttransfers.com Brazil Airport Transfers] should be able to assist airport transfer or transport requirements.

===Metro===
{{Main|Brasília Metro}}
[[File:Metrô DF - 102 Sul.png|thumb|right|102 Sul [[Metro Station]].]]
[[File:Trem Leve Brasilia (VLT) Panorama 1.jpg|thumb|right|Brasília's new tram to be built on W3 Avenue.]]
[[Brasília Metro|Metrô de Brasília]] is Brasília's underground [[Rapid transit|metro system]]. The subway system has 24 stations on two lines, the Orange and Green lines, distributed along a total network of {{convert|42|km|mi|abbr=on}}, covering some of the metropolitan area. Both lines begin at the Central Station and run parallel until the Águas Claras Station. The Brasília metro is not comprehensive, so buses may provide better access to the city centre.

The metro leaves the Rodoviária (bus station) and goes south, avoiding most of the political and tourist areas. The main purpose of the metro is to serve cities, such as Samambaia, [[Taguatinga, Federal District|Taguatinga]] and [[Ceilândia]], as well as Guará and Águas Claras. The satellite cities served are more populated in total than the Plano Piloto itself (the census of 2000 indicated that [[Ceilândia]] had 344,039 inhabitants, Taguatinga had 243,575, whereas the Plano Piloto had approximately 400,000 inhabitants), and most residents of the satellite cities depend on public transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.df.gov.br/ |title=Brasília Metro |publisher=Metro.df.gov.br |date= |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High-speed rail===
A [[High-speed rail in Brazil|high-speed railway]] was planned between Brasília and Goiânia, the capital of the state of Goias, although it will probably be turned into a regional service linking these capital cities and cities in between, like Anápolis and Alexânia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fábio Amato Do G1, em Brasília |url=http://g1.globo.com/distrito-federal/noticia/2012/06/estudo-vai-apontar-viabilidade-de-trem-entre-brasilia-anapolis-e-goiania.html |title=G1 - Estudo vai apontar viabilidade de trem entre Brasília, Anápolis e Goiânia - notícias em Distrito Federal |publisher=G1.globo.com |date=2012-06-28 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buses===

The main bus hub in Brasília is the Central Bus Station, located in the crossing of the [[Monumental Axis|Eixo Monumental]] and the Eixão, about {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the Three Powers Plaza. The original plan was to have a bus station as near as possible to every corner of Brasília. Today, the bus station is the hub of urban buses only, some running within Brasília and others connecting Brasília to the satellite cities.

In the original city plan, the interstate buses should also stop at the Central Station. Because of the growth of Brasília (and corresponding growth in the bus fleet), today the interstate buses leave from the older interstate station (called Rodoferroviária), located at the western end of the Eixo Monumental. The Central Bus Station also contains a main metro station.

A new bus station was opened in July 2010. It is on Saída Sul (South Exit) near Parkshopping Mall and with its metro station, and it's also an inter-state bus station, used only to leave the Federal District.
