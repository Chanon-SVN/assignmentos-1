The Black Death is thought to have originated in the arid plains of [[Central Asia]], where it then travelled along the [[Silk Road]], reaching the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] by 1343.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/blackdisease_01.shtml|title=BBC – History – Black Death |publisher=BBC |date=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there, it was most likely carried by [[Oriental rat flea]]s living on the [[black rat]]s that were regular passengers on [[cargo ship|merchant ships]].

The aftermath of the plague created a series of religious, social, and economic upheavals, which had profound effects on the course of [[European history]]. It took {{val|150|u=years}} for Europe's population to recover.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The plague recurred occasionally in Europe until the 19th&amp;nbsp;century.

==Chronology==

===Origins of the disease===
{{Main|Black Death migration}}
The plague disease, caused by ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', is [[enzootic]] (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground [[rodent]]s, including [[marmot]]s, in various areas including Central Asia, Kurdistan, Western Asia, Northern India and Uganda.{{sfn|Ziegler|1998|p=25}} [[Nestorian]] graves dating to 1338–9 near [[Lake Issyk Kul]] in [[Kyrgizstan]] have inscriptions referring to plague and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic, from which it could easily have spread to China and India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Paleomicrobiology: Past Human Infections |last1=Raoult |last2=Drancourt |year=2008 |publisher=Springer |page=152 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2010, medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in China.&lt;ref name=china&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Nicholas Wade]] |title=Europe’s Plagues Came From China, Study Finds |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/health/01plague.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=31 October 2010 |accessdate=1 November 2010 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; In China, the 13th century [[Mongol invasion of China|Mongol conquest]] caused a decline in farming and trading. However, economic recovery had been observed at the beginning of the 14th&amp;nbsp;century. In the 1330s a large number of natural disasters and plagues led to widespread famine, starting in 1331, with a deadly plague arriving soon after.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of China: Alien regimes and border states, 907–1368, p.585&lt;/ref&gt; Epidemics which may have included plague killed an estimated 25&amp;nbsp;million Chinese and other Asians during the 15&amp;nbsp;years before it reached Constantinople in 1347.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = George C. | last = Kohn | title = Encyclopedia of plague and pestilence: from ancient times to the present  | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=tzRwRmb09rgC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | publisher = Infobase Publishing | year = 2008 | page = 31 | isbn = 0-8160-6935-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to George Sussman, the first obvious medical description of plague in China dates to 1644.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sussman GD | title = Was the black death in India and China? | journal = Bulletin of the history of medicine | volume = 85 | issue = 3 | pages = 319–55 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22080795 | doi = 10.1353/bhm.2011.0054 | url = http://contagions.wordpress.com/2011/11/26/did-india-and-china-escape-the-black-death/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disease may have travelled along the Silk Road with [[Mongols|Mongol]] armies and traders or it could have come via ship.&lt;ref&gt;
{{Cite journal |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/8102278/Black-Death-may-have-originated-in-China.html |title=Black Death may have originated in China |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=1 November 2010 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1346, reports of plague had reached the seaports of Europe: &quot;India was depopulated, Tartary, Mesopotamia, Syria, Armenia were covered with dead bodies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hecker|1859|p=21}} cited by Ziegler, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plague was reportedly first introduced to Europe at the trading city of [[Feodosiya|Caffa]] in the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] in 1347. After a protracted siege, during which the Mongol army under [[Jani Beg]] was suffering from the disease, the army catapulted the infected corpses over the [[Defensive wall|city walls]] to infect the inhabitants. The [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] traders fled, taking the plague by ship into [[Sicily]] and the south of Europe, whence it spread north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/a-b/blackdeath.html |title=Channel 4 – History – The Black Death |publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=3 November 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080625094232/http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/H/history/a-b/blackdeath.html |archivedate=25 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not this hypothesis is accurate, it is clear that several existing conditions such as war, famine, and weather contributed to the severity of the Black Death.

===European outbreak===
{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=The seventh year after it began, it came to England and first began in the towns and ports joining on the seacoasts, in Dorsetshire, where, as in other counties, it made the country quite void of inhabitants so that there were almost none left alive.&lt;br /&gt;... But at length it came to Gloucester, yea even to Oxford and to London, and finally it spread over all England and so wasted the people that scarce the tenth person of any sort was left alive.|source=[[Geoffrey the Baker]], ''Chronicon Angliae''}}

There appear to have been several introductions into Europe. The plague reached Sicily in October 1347, carried by twelve Genoese galleys,&lt;ref&gt;
Michael of Piazza (Platiensis) ''Bibliotheca scriptorum qui res in Sicilia gestas retulere'' Vol 1, p. 562, cited in Ziegler, 1998, p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; and rapidly spread all over the island. Galleys from [[Feodosia|Caffa]] reached Genoa and Venice in January 1348, but it was the outbreak in Pisa a few weeks later that was the entry point to northern Italy. Towards the end of January, one of the galleys expelled from Italy arrived in [[Marseille]].&lt;ref&gt;De Smet, Vol II, ''Breve Chronicon'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Italy, the disease spread northwest across Europe, striking France, Spain, Portugal and England by June 1348, then turned and spread east through Germany and Scandinavia from 1348–50. It was introduced in Norway in 1349 when a ship landed at [[Askøy]], then spread to Bjørgvin (modern [[Bergen]]) and [[Iceland]].&lt;ref&gt;

Hurst |page=111 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=4eRLXJpf2EoC |isbn=978-1-85065-420-9 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally it spread to northwestern Russia in 1351. The plague spared some parts of Europe, including the [[Piast Poland#The_Kingdom_of_Later_Piasts_(1295–1370)|Kingdom of Poland]], the majority of the [[Basque Country_(greater_region)|Basque Country]] and isolated parts of Belgium and the Netherlands.{{dubious|Poland|date=October 2011}}

===Middle Eastern outbreak===
The plague struck various countries in the Middle East during the [[pandemic]], leading to serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures. As it spread to western Europe, the disease entered the region from southern Russia also. By autumn 1347, the plague reached [[Alexandria]] in Egypt, probably through the port's trade with [[Constantinople]], and ports on the [[Black Sea]]. During 1347, the disease travelled eastward to [[Gaza City|Gaza]], and north along the eastern coast to cities in [[Lebanon]], [[Syria]] and [[Palestine]], including [[Ashkelon]], [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Sidon]], [[Damascus]], [[Homs]], and [[Aleppo]]. In 1348–49, the disease reached [[Antioch]]. The city's residents fled to the north, most of them dying during the journey, but the infection had been spread to the people of Asia Minor.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

[[Mecca]] became infected in 1349. During the same year, records show the city of [[Mawsil]] (Mosul) suffered a massive epidemic, and the city of Baghdad experienced a second round of the disease. In 1351 [[Yemen]] experienced an outbreak of the plague, coinciding with the return of [[King Mujahid]] of Yemen from imprisonment in [[Cairo]]. His party may have brought the disease with them from Egypt.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Symptoms==

Swollen lymph glands (''buboes'') often occur in the neck, armpit and groin (''inguinal'') regions of plague victims]]Contemporary accounts of the plague are often varied or imprecise. The most commonly noted symptom was the appearance of [[bubo]]es (or gavocciolos) in the groin, the neck and armpits, which oozed pus and bled when opened.&lt;ref name=Byrne2004pp21-9/&gt; [[Boccaccio]]'s description is graphic:

{{quotation|In men and women alike it first betrayed itself by the emergence of certain tumours in the groin or armpits, some of which grew as large as a common apple, others as an egg...From the two said parts of the body this deadly gavocciolo soon began to propagate and spread itself in all directions indifferently; after which the form of the malady began to change, black spots or livid making their appearance in many cases on the arm or the thigh or elsewhere, now few and large, now minute and numerous. As the gavocciolo had been and still was an infallible token of approaching death, such also were these spots on whomsoever they showed themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Giovanni Boccaccio|title=Decameron|year=1351/3|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ziegler comments that the only medical detail that is questionable is the infallibility of approaching death, as if the bubo discharges, recovery is possible.{{sfn|Ziegler|1998|p=18,19}}

This was followed by acute fever and vomiting of blood. Most victims died two to seven days after initial infection. David Herlihy identifies freckle-like spots and rashes&lt;ref&gt;D. Herlihy, ''The Black Death and the Transformation of the West'' (Harvard University Press: Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1997), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; which could be caused by flea-bites as another potential sign of the plague.

Some accounts, like that of Louis Heyligen, a musician in [[Avignon]] who died of the plague in 1348, noted a distinct form of the disease which infected the lungs and led to respiratory problems&lt;ref name=Byrne2004pp21-9/&gt; and which is identified with [[pneumonic plague]].

{{quotation|It is said that the plague takes three forms. In the first people suffer an infection of the lungs, which leads to breathing difficulties. Whoever has this corruption or contamination to any extent cannot escape but will die within two days. Another form...in which boils erupt under the armpits,...a third form in which people of both sexes are attacked in the groin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Rosemary|last=Horrox|year=1994|title=Black Death|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1O_PX2wVD0sC&amp;pg=PA41|isbn=978-0-7190-3498-5|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Naming===
[[Middle Ages|Medieval]] people called the catastrophe of the 14th&amp;nbsp;century either the &quot;Great Pestilence&quot;' or the &quot;Great Plague&quot;.&lt;ref name=Bennet&amp;Hollister2006&gt;J. M. Bennett and C. W. Hollister, ''Medieval Europe: A Short History'' (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2006), p. 326.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1350, Simon de Covino (or Couvin), a Belgian astronomer, wrote the poem &quot;''De judicio Solis in convivio Saturni''&quot; (On the judgment of the Sun at a feast of Saturn) in which he attributed the plague to a conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn.
*  On page 22 of the manuscript in [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b9078277z/f25.image Gallica], Simon mentions the phrase &quot;''mors nigra''&quot; (Black Death):  &quot;''Cum rex finisset oracula judiciorum / Mors nigra surrexit, et gentes reddidit illi'';&quot; (When the king ended the oracles of judgment / Black Death arose, and the nations surrendered to him;).
*  A more legible copy of the poem appears in:  Emile Littré (1841) [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/bec_0373-6237_1841_num_2_1_451584?_Prescripts_Search_tabs1=standard&amp; &quot;Opuscule relatif à la peste de 1348, composé par un contemporain&quot;]  (Work concerning the plague of 1348, composed by a contemporary), ''Bibliothèque de l'école des chartes'', '''2''' (2) :  201-243; see especially page 228.
*  See also:  Joseph Patrick Byrne, ''The Black Death'' (Westport, Connecticut:  Greenwood Press, 2004), [http://books.google.com/books?id=yw3HmjRvVQMC&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 1.]
&lt;/ref&gt; Writers contemporary to the plague referred to the event as the &quot;Great Mortality&quot;. Swedish and Danish chronicles of the 17th&amp;nbsp;century described the events as &quot;black&quot; for the first time, not to describe the late-stage sign of the disease, in which the sufferer's skin would blacken due to [[purpura|subepidermal hemorrhages]] and the extremities would darken with a form of [[gangrene]], [[acral necrosis]], but more likely to refer to black in the sense of glum or dreadful and to denote the terror and gloom of the events.  Gasquet (1908) claimed that the Latin name &quot;''atra mors''&quot; (Black Death) for an epidemic first appeared in modern times in 1631 in a book on Danish history by [[Johan Isaksson Pontanus|J.I. Pontanus]], where Pontanus wrote about a disease that occurred in 1348:  &quot;''Vulgo &amp; ab effectu ''atram mortem'' vocatibant.''&quot;  Commonly and from its effects, they called it the black death.&lt;ref&gt;Francis Aidan Gasquet, ''The Black Death of 1348 and 1349'', 2nd ed. (London, England:  George Bell and Sons, 1908), [http://books.google.com/books?id=5wMAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA7#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 7.]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
D'Irsay points out that the phrase &quot;black death&quot; dates back at least to Homer's ''Odyssey'', where Homer said that Scylla's mouth contained rows of teeth πλείοι μέλανος θανάτοιο (full of black death).  Many Roman authors also used the phrase.  The medieval French physician [[Gilles de Corbeil]] (c. 1140 - (1200-1225)) in his ''De signis et sinthomatibus egritudinum'' (On the signs and symptoms of diseases) referred to a pestilential fever (''febris pestilentialis'') as &quot;''atra mors''&quot; (black death).  See:  Stephen d'Irsay (May 1926) &quot;Notes to the origin of the expression:  atra mors,&quot; ''Isis'', '''8''' (2) :  328-332.
&lt;/ref&gt;  This may have been a mistranslation, as ''atra'' can mean ''black'', ''brooding'' or ''terrible''.{{sfn|Benedictow|2004|p=3}}   Nevertheless, the name spread through Scandinavia and then Germany.&lt;ref&gt;The German physician [[Justus Friedrich Karl Hecker|Justus Hecker]] (1795-1850) cited the phrase in Icelandic (''Svartur Daudi''), Danish (''den sorte Dod''), etc.  See:  J.F.C. Hecker, ''Der schwarze Tod im vierzehnten Jahrhundert'' [The Black Death in the Fourteenth Century] (Berlin, (Germany):  Friedr. Aug. Herbig, 1832), [http://books.google.com/books?id=LhoqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 3.]&lt;/ref&gt;  In England, it was not until 1823 that the medieval epidemic was first called the Black Death.&lt;ref&gt;The name &quot;Black Death&quot; first appeared in English in:
*  &quot;Mrs. Markham&quot; (pen name of Elizabeth Penrose (née Cartwright)), ''A History of England'' ... (Edinburgh, Scotland:  Archibald Constable, 1823).  In the 1829 edition, the relevant text appeared on pages 249-250, where, about the English king Edward III, she wrote:  &quot;Edward's successes in France were interrupted during the next six years by a most terrible pestilence — so terrible as to be called the black death — which raged throughout Europe, and proved a greater scourge to the people than even the calamities of war.&quot;  (For further information about this book and Mrs. Penrose, see:  [[s:Penrose, Elizabeth (DNB00)|Wikisource]] and [http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=21889&amp;back= the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]).

The name &quot;Black Death&quot; was spread more widely when in 1833, Benjamin Guy Babington published an English translation of J.F.C. Hecker's book ''Der schwarze Tod im vierzehnten Jahrhundert'' as:  J.F.C. Hecker with Benjamin Guy Babington, trans., ''The Black Death in the Fourteenth Century'' (London, England:  A. Schloss, 1833).

Medical knowledge had stagnated during the [[Middle Ages]]. The most authoritative account at the time came from the medical faculty in Paris in a report to the [[Philip VI of France|king of France]] that blamed the heavens, in the form of a [[Conjunction (astronomy)|conjunction]] of three planets in 1345 that caused a &quot;great pestilence in the air&quot;.{{sfn|Horrox|1994|p=159}} This report became the first and most widely circulated of a series of &quot;plague tracts&quot; that sought to give advice to sufferers. That the plague was caused by ''bad air'' became the most widely accepted theory. The word ''plague'' had no special significance at this time, and only the recurrence of outbreaks during the Middle Ages gave it the name that has become the medical term.

The importance of hygiene was recognised only in the nineteenth century; until then it was common that the streets were filthy, with live animals of all sorts around and human parasites abounding. A transmissible disease will spread easily in such conditions. One development as a result of the Black Death was the establishment of the idea of [[quarantine]] in [[Dubrovnik]] in 1377 after continuing outbreaks.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | author = Sehdev PS | title = The Origin of Quarantine | journal = Clinical Infectious Diseases | volume = 35 | issue = 9 | pages = 1071–1072 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12398064 | doi = 10.1086/344062 | url = http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/9/1071.full }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant explanation for the Black Death is the [[Plague (disease)|plague]] theory, which attributes the outbreak to ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', also responsible for an epidemic that began in southern China in 1865, eventually spreading to India. The investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited Hong Kong in 1894, among whom was the French-Swiss bacteriologist [[Alexandre Yersin]], after whom the pathogen was named ''Yersinia pestis''.&lt;ref name=Chritakos2005&gt;G. Christakos, ''Interdisciplinary Public Health Reasoning and Epidemic Modelling: the Case of Black Death'' (シュプリンガー・ジャパン株式会社, 2005), ISBN 3-540-25794-2, pp. 110–14.&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism by which ''Y. pestis'' was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by [[Paul-Louis Simond]] and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose [[midgut]]s had become obstructed by replicating ''Y. pestis'' several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by [[vomiting|regurgitation]], resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]]; and a second that lack resistance. When the second population dies, the fleas move on to other hosts, including people, thus creating a human [[Epidemic typhus|epidemic]].&lt;ref name=Chritakos2005/&gt;

The historian [[Francis Aidan Gasquet]], who had written about the 'Great Pestilence' in 1893{{sfn|Gasquet|1893}} and suggested that &quot;it would appear to be some form of the ordinary Eastern or bubonic plague&quot; was able to adopt the epidemiology of the bubonic plague for the Black Death for the second edition in 1908, implicating rats and fleas in the process, and his interpretation was widely accepted for other ancient and medieval epidemics, such as the [[Justinian plague]] that was prevalent in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] from 541 to 700 CE.&lt;ref name=Chritakos2005/&gt;

Other forms of plague have been implicated by modern scientists. The modern [[bubonic plague]] has a [[mortality rate]] of 30–75% and symptoms including fever of {{convert|38|–|41|°C|°F}}, headaches, painful aching joints, [[nausea]] and vomiting, and a general feeling of [[malaise]]. Left untreated, of those that contract the bubonic plague, 80 percent die within eight days.&lt;ref&gt;R. Totaro, ''Suffering in Paradise: The Bubonic Plague in English Literature from More to Milton'' (Pittsburgh: Duquesne University Press, 2005), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pneumonic plague]] has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 percent. Symptoms include fever, cough, and blood-tinged [[sputum]]. As the disease progresses, sputum becomes free flowing and bright red. [[Septicemic plague]] is the least common of the three forms, with a mortality rate near 100%. Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches ([[purpura]] due to [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]]). In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time for the development of the enlarged lymph nodes that were noted as buboes.{{sfn|Byrne|2004|p=8}}

&quot;Many modern scholars accept that the lethality of the Black Death stemmed from the combination of bubonic and pneumonic plague with other diseases and warn that every historical mention of 'pest' was not necessarily bubonic plague... In her study of 15th-century outbreaks, Ann Carmichael states that worms, the pox, fevers and dysentery clearly accompanied bubonic plague.&quot;{{sfn|Byrne|2004|p=27.

The second pandemic of bubonic plague was active in Europe from AD 1347, the beginning of the Black Death, until 1750.]]

In October 2010, the open-access scientific journal ''[[PLoS Pathogens]]'' published a paper by a multinational team who undertook a new investigation into the role of ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' in the Black Death following the disputed identification by Drancourt and Raoult in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;

The authors concluded that this new research, together with prior analyses from the south of France and Germany

{{bq|1=...ends the debate about the [[etiology]] of the Black Death, and unambiguously demonstrates that ''Y. pestis'' was the causative agent of the epidemic plague that devastated Europe during the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=Haensch2010/&gt;}}

The study also found that there were two previously unknown but related [[clade]]s (genetic branches) of the ''Y. pestis'' [[genome]] associated with medieval mass graves. These clades (which are thought to be extinct) were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the modern ''Y. pestis'' strains ''Y. p. orientalis'' and ''Y. p. medievalis'', suggesting the plague may have entered Europe in two waves. Surveys of [[plague pit]] remains in France and England indicate the first variant entered Europe through the port of [[Marseille]] around November 1347 and spread through France over the next two years, eventually reaching England in the spring of 1349, where it spread through the country in three epidemics. Surveys of plague pit remains from the Dutch town of [[Bergen op Zoom]] showed the ''Y. pestis'' genotype responsible for the pandemic that spread through the Low Countries from 1350 differed from that found in Britain and France, implying Bergen op Zoom (and possibly other parts of the southern Netherlands) was not directly infected from England or France in 1349 and suggesting a second wave of plague, different from those in Britain and France, may have been carried to the Low Countries from Norway, the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] cities or another site.&lt;ref name=Haensch2010&gt;{{cite journal | author = Haensch S, Bianucci R, Signoli M, Rajerison M, Schultz M, Kacki S, Vermunt M, Weston DA, Hurst D, Achtman M, Carniel E, Bramanti B | title = Distinct Clones of Yersinia pestis Caused the Black Death | journal = PLoS Pathogens | volume = 6 | issue = 10 | pages = e1001134 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20949072 | pmc = 2951374 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001134 | editor1-last = Besansky | editor1-first = Nora J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the Haensch study have since been confirmed and amended. Based on genetic evidence derived from Black Death victims in the [[East Smithfield]] burial site in England, Schuenemann et al. concluded in 2011 &quot;that the Black Death in medieval Europe was caused by a variant of ''Y. pestis'' that may no longer exist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schuenemann VJ, Bos K, DeWitte S, Schmedes S, Jamieson J, Mittnik A, Forrest S, Coombes BK, Wood JW, Earn DJD, White W, Krause J, Poinar H (2011): [http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/08/24/1105107108.full.pdf+html Targeted enrichment of ancient pathogens yielding the pPCP1 plasmid of Yersinia pestis from victims of the Black Death.] PNAS 2011; published ahead of print 29 August 2011, {{doi|10.1073/pnas.1105107108}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in October 2011 sequenced the genome of ''Y. pestis'' from plague victims and indicated that the strain that caused the Black Death is ancestral to most modern strains of the disease.&lt;ref name='nature_bos'/&gt;

DNA taken from 25 skeletons in London that died in the 14th century, have shown the plague is a strain of ''Y. pestis'' that is almost identical to that which hit Madagascar in 2013.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26770334 Black Death skeletons unearthed by Crossrail project]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative explanations===
{{Main|Theories of the Black Death}}

This interpretation was first significantly challenged by the work of British bacteriologist J. F. D. Shrewsbury in 1970, who noted that the reported rates of mortality in rural areas during the 14th-century pandemic were inconsistent with the modern bubonic plague, leading him to conclude that contemporary accounts were exaggerations.&lt;ref name=Chritakos2005/&gt; In 1984 zoologist Graham Twigg produced the first major work to challenge the bubonic plague theory directly, and his doubts about the identity of the Black Death have been taken up by a number of authors, including Samuel K. Cohn, Jr. (2002), [[David Herlihy]] (1997), and Susan Scott and Christopher Duncan (2001).&lt;ref name=Chritakos2005/&gt;

It is recognised that an [[epidemiological]] account of the plague is as important as an identification of symptoms, but researchers are hampered by the lack of reliable statistics from this period. Most work has been done on the spread of the plague in England, and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100% as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the [[Domesday Book]] and the year 1377.{{sfn|Ziegler|1998|p=233}} Estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures from the clergy.

In addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic, sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the Black Death are not unique (and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague); that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance and that the DNA results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere, despite extensive samples from other mass graves.&lt;ref name=Chritakos2005/&gt; Other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries; temperatures that are too cold in northern Europe for the survival of fleas; that, despite primitive transport systems, the spread of the Black Death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague; that mortality rates of the Black Death appear to be very high; that, while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease, the Black Death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas; and that the pattern of the Black Death, with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years, differs from modern bubonic plague—which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare-ups.&lt;ref name=Chritakos2005/&gt;

Walløe complains that all of these authors &quot;take it for granted that Simond's infection model, black rat → rat flea → human, which was developed to explain the spread of plague in India, is the only way an epidemic of ''Yersinia pestis'' infection could spread&quot;, whilst pointing to several other possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medieval and Modern Bubonic Plague: some clinical continuities|first =Lars|last=Walloe|page=69|series=Pestilential Complexities: Understanding Medieval Plague|editor=Vivian Nutton|publisher=Wellcome Trust Centre for the History of Medicine at UCL|year=2008|ref=harv}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anthrax PHIL 2033.png|thumb|[[Anthrax]] skin lesion]]
A variety of alternatives to the ''Y. pestis'' have been put forward. Twigg suggested that the cause was a form of [[anthrax]] and [[Norman Cantor|N. F. Cantor]] (2001) thought it may have been a combination of anthrax and other pandemics. Scott and Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a form of infectious disease that characterise as ''hemorrhagic'' plague similar to [[Ebola]]. Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the ''Y. pestis'' was spread from fleas on rats and argues that transmission must have been person to person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=M.

In addition to the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a type of &quot;blood poisoning&quot;) and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms of the plague, which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms.&lt;ref name=Byrne2004pp21-9&gt;{{harvnb|Byrne|2004|pp=21–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, scientists with [[Public Health England]] announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the Clerkenwell area of London, as well as of wills registered in London during the period, which supported the pneumonic hypothesis.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The trend of recent research is pointing to a figure more like 45–50% of the European population dying during a four-year period. There is a fair amount of geographic variation. In Mediterranean Europe, areas such as Italy, the south of France and Spain, where plague ran for about four years consecutively, it was probably closer to 75–80% of the population. In Germany and England ... it was probably closer to 20%.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Daileader]], ''The Late Middle Ages'', audio/video course produced by [[The Teaching Company]], (2007) ISBN 978-1-59803-345-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In crowded cities, it was not uncommon for as much as 50% of the population to die. The disease bypassed some areas, and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion. Monks and priests were especially hard hit since they cared for the Black Death's victims.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Bennett and C. W.

Renewed religious fervor and fanaticism bloomed in the wake of the Black Death.

[[Leprosy|Lepers]], and other individuals with skin diseases such as [[Acne vulgaris|acne]] or [[psoriasis]], were singled out and exterminated throughout Europe.

Because 14th-century healers were at a loss to explain the cause, Europeans turned to astrological forces, earthquakes, and the poisoning of wells by Jews as possible reasons for the plague's emergence.&lt;ref name=Bennet&amp;Hollister2006/&gt; The governments of Europe had no apparent response to the crisis because no one knew its cause or how it spread. The mechanism of infection and transmission of diseases was little understood in the 14th century; many people believed only God's anger could produce such horrific displays.

The Third plague pandemic (1855–1859) started in China in the middle of the 19th century, spreading to all inhabited continents and killing 10 million people in India alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/321/5890/773 Infectious Diseases: Plague Through History], sciencemag.org&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve plague outbreaks in Australia in 1900–25 resulted in well over {{val|fmt=commas|1000|u=deaths}}, chiefly in Sydney. This led to the establishment of a Public Health Department there which undertook some leading-edge research on plague transmission from rat fleas to humans via the bacillus ''Yersinia pestis''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sydney.edu.au/medicine/museum/mwmuseum/index.php/Bubonic_Plague_comes_to_Sydney_in_1900 Bubonic Plague comes to Sydney in 1900], University of Sydney, Sydney Medical School&lt;/ref&gt;
