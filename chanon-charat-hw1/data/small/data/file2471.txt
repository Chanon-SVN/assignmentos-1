'''Barcelonnette''' ({{Lang-oc|Barcilona de Provença}}) is a [[Communes of France|commune]] of [[France]] and a [[Subprefectures in France|subprefecture]] in the [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]], in the [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] region. It is located in the southern [[French Alps]], at the crossroads between [[Provence]], [[Piedmont]] and the [[Dauphiné]], and is the largest town in the [[Ubaye Valley]]. The town's inhabitants are known as ''Barcelonnettes''.

==Toponymy==
Barcelonnette was founded and named in 1231, by [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Provence|Ramon Berenguer IV]], [[Rulers of Provence|Count of Provence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dauzat&quot;&gt;[[Albert Dauzat]] and [[Charles Rostaing]], ''Dictionnaire étymologique des noms de lieux en France'', Éd. Larousse, 1968, pp. 1693–1694.&lt;/ref&gt; While the town's name is generally seen as a diminutive form of [[Barcelona]] in [[Spain]], [[Albert Dauzat]] and [[Charles Rostaing]] point out an earlier attestation of the name ''Barcilona'' in Barcelonnette in around 1200, and suggest that it is derived instead from two earlier stems signifying a mountain, *''bar'' and *''cin'' (the latter of which is also seen in the name of [[Mont Cenis]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Rostaing&quot;&gt;[[Charles Rostaing]], ''Essai sur la toponymie de la Provence (depuis les origines jusqu’aux invasions barbares'', Laffite Reprints, Marseille, 1973 (1st edition 1950), p 91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TGF&quot;&gt;Ernest Nègre, ''Toponymie générale de la France : étymologie de 35 000 noms de lieux'', Genève : Librairie Droz, 1990. Collection ''Publications romanes et françaises'', volume CVCIII. Volume III : Formations dialectales (suite) ; formations françaises § 30208 § 30208&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Vivaro-Alpine]] dialect of [[Occitan language|Occitan]], the town is known as ''Barcilona de Provença'' or more rarely ''Barciloneta'' according to the [[Occitan language#Writing system|classical norm]]; under the [[Occitan language#Writing system|Mistralian norm]] it is called ''Barcilouna de Prouvença'' or ''Barcilouneto''. In ''Valéian'' (the dialect of Occitan spoken in the Ubaye Valley), it is called ''Barcilouna de Prouvença'' or ''Barcilounéta''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnaud-Maurin&quot;&gt;François Arnaud, Gabriel Maurin, ''Le langage de la vallée de Barcelonnette'', Paris : Champion, 1920 - Re-edited in 1973, Marseille: Laffitte Reprints&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fortoul&quot;&gt;Jean-Rémy Fortoul, ''Ubaye, la mémoire de mon pays : les gens, les bêtes, les choses, le temps'', Barcelonnette: Sabença de la Valeia/Mane: Alpes de Lumière, 1995.

The inhabitants of the town are called ''Barcelonnettes'', or ''Vilandroises'' in Valéian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnaud-Maurin&quot;/&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
The Barcelonnette region was populated by [[Ligures]] from the 1st millennium BC onwards, and the arrival of the [[Celts]] several centuries later led to the formation of a mixed Celto-Ligurian people, the [[Vesubians]]. [[Polybius]] described the Vesubians as belligerent but nonetheless civilised and mercantile, and [[Julius Caesar]] praised their bravery.&lt;ref&gt;''Vallis Montium : Histoire de la vallée de Barcelonnette'', p.12 and p.15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZzsXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=%C3%A9subiens&amp;as_brr=3&amp;hl=fr#PPA31,M1 Recherche sur la géographie ancienne et les antiquités du département des Basses-Alpes]'', p. 30, le col de la Magdeleine étant l'ancien nom du col de Larche, ''Colle della Maddalena'' in Italian.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://books.google.fr/books?id=AncBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=%C3%89subiens&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8zRprnJyqt&amp;sig=A4Az5L3mNRIY82XPg_F3ZILrUT0&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=P5L1Sfm5OcnOjAeq5P3ADA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5 Dictionnaire historique et topographique de la Provence ancienne et moderne]'', page 115&lt;/ref&gt; The work ''History of the Gauls'' also places the Vesubians in the Ubaye Valley.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://books.google.fr/books?id=M8oWAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA218&amp;dq=ubaye&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1 Histoire des Gaules, et des conquêtes des Gaulois depuis leur origine jusqu'à la fondation de la Monarchie française]'', 1754&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[History of Provence#The Roman Conquest of Provence|Roman conquest of Provence]], Barcelonnette was included in a small province with modern [[Embrun, Hautes-Alpes|Embrun]] as its capital and governed by Albanus Bassalus. This was integrated soon afterwards into [[Gallia Narbonensis]].&lt;ref&gt;''Vallis Montium : Histoire de la vallée de Barcelonnette'', p.16&lt;/ref&gt; In 36 AD, Emperor [[Nero]] transferred Barcelonnette to the province of the [[Cottian Alps]]. The town was known as ''Rigomagensium'' under the [[Roman Empire]] and was the capital of a civitas (a provincial subdivision),&lt;ref name=&quot;Collier15&quot; &gt;Raymond Collier, ''La Haute-Provence monumentale et artistique'', Digne, Imprimerie Louis Jean, 1986, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; though no Roman money has yet been found in the canton of Barcelonnette.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collier37&quot; &gt;Raymond Collier, ''La Haute-Provence monumentale et artistique'', p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval town===
The town of Barcelonnette was founded in 1231 by [[Ramon Berenguer IV of Provence|Ramon Berenguer IV]], [[Rulers of Provence|Count of Provence]]. According to Charles Rostaing, this act of formal &quot;foundation&quot;, according certain privileges to the town, was a means of regenerating the destroyed town of ''Barcilona''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rostaing&quot;/&gt; The town was afforded a ''consulat'' (giving it the power to administer and defend itself) in 1240.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHP&quot;&gt;Under the direction of Édouard Baratier, Georges Duby, and Ernest Hildesheimer, ''Atlas historique. Provence, Comtat Venaissin, principauté d’Orange, comté de Nice, principauté de Monaco'', Librairie Armand Colin, Paris, 1969, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

Control of the area in the [[Middle Ages]] swung between the [[Counts of Savoy]] and [[Rulers of Provence|of Provence]]. In 1388, after Count [[Louis II of Anjou|Louis II]] of Provence had left to conquer [[Naples]], the Count of Savoy [[Amadeus VIII of Savoy|Amadeus VIII]] took control of Barcelonnette; however, it returned to Provençal control in 1390, with the d'Audiffret family as its lords. On the death of Louis II in 1417 it reverted to Savoy, and, although Count [[René of Anjou|René]] again retook the area for Provence in 1471, it had returned to Savoyard dominance by the start of the 16th century, by which point the County of Provence had become united with the Kingdom of France due to the death of Count [[Charles IV, Duke of Anjou|Charles V]] in 1481.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.fr/books?id=7DQOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA674 Google Books: Aristide Mathieu Guilbert, ''Histoire des Villes de France''. First book, pp. 674-676, Paris, 1844]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancien Régime===
During [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]'s invasion of Provence in 1536, [[Francis I of France]] sent the [[Count of Fürstenberg]]'s 6000 ''[[Landsknechte]]'' to ravage the area in a [[scorched earth]] policy. Barcelonnette and the Ubaye Valley remained under French sovereignty until the second [[Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis]] on 3 April 1559.

In 1588 the troops of [[François de Bonne, Duke of Lesdiguières|François, Duke of Lesdiguières]] entered the town and set fire to the church and convent during their campaign against the Duke of Savoy. In 1600, after the [[Treaty of Vervins]], conflict returned between [[Henry IV of France]] and Savoy, and Lesdiguières retook Barcelonnette until the conclusion of the [[Treaty of Lyon (1601)|Treaty of Lyon]] on 17 January the following year. In 1628, during the [[War of the Mantuan Succession]], Barcelonnette and the other towns of the Ubaye Valley were pillaged and burned by Jacques du Blé d'Uxelles and his troops, as they passed through towards Italy to the [[Duke of Mantua]]'s aid. The town was retaken by the Duke of Savoy in 1630; and in 1691 it was captured by the troops of the Marquis de Vins during the [[War of the League of Augsburg]].

Between 1614 and 1713, Barcelonnette was the seat of one of the four prefectures under the jurisdiction of the Senate of Nice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jc.clariond.free.fr/dixneuf.html#19p4 Histoire d'Allos : la préfecture de Barcelonnette]&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the community of Barcelonnette successfully purchased the ''[[seigneurie]]'' of the town as it was put to auction by the Duke of Savoy; it thereby gained its own justicial powers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rébellion&quot;&gt;Jean Nicolas, ''La Rébellion française : mouvements populaires et conscience sociale, 1661-1789'', Paris: Gallimard, 2008. Collection ''Folio'', ISBN 978-2-07-035971-4, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; In 1646, a college was founded in Barcelonnette.&lt;ref name=&quot;histo_sous-pref&quot;&gt;Prefecture of Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, &quot;[http://www.alpes-de-haute-provence.pref.gouv.fr/pages/sous-prefectures/barcelonnette/barcelonnette.html Histoire de l'Arrondissement de Barcelonnette] », ''Préfecture des Alpes de Haute-Provence'', accessed 23 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

A &quot;significant&quot; part of the town's inhabitants had, by the 16th century, converted to [[Protestantism]], and were repressed during the [[French Wars of Religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Audisio and Jean Jalla, ''Les protestants de la vallée de Barcelonnette'', expanded and updated edition from the brochure ''Les Vaudois à Barcelonnette''&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[viguerie]]'' of Barcelonnette (also comprising [[Saint-Martin-d'Entraunes|Saint-Martin]] and [[Entraunes]]) was reattached to France in 1713 as part of a territorial exchange with the Duchy of Savoy during the [[Treaties of Utrecht]]. The town remained the site of a ''viguerie'' until the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;viguerie&quot;&gt;''La Révolution dans les Basses-Alpes'', Annales de Haute-Provence, bulletin de la société scientifique et littéraire des Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, no 307, 1st term 1989, 108th year, p 107&lt;/ref&gt; A decree of the council of state on 25 December 1714 reunited Barcelonnete with the general government of Provence.

===Revolution===
Barcelonnette was one of few settlements in Haute-Provence to acquire a [[Masonic Lodge]] before the Revolution, in fact having two:
* the lodge of ''Saint-Jean-d’Écosse des amis réunis'', affiliated with the ''Saint-Jean-d'Écosse'' lodge in [[Marseille]];
* the lodge of ''Saint-Jean'', affiliated with the ''Saint-Jean-de-Jérusalem d'Avignon'' lodge founded in 1749.&lt;ref name=&quot;AHP-c120&quot;&gt;[[Robert-Henri Bautier]], &quot;Les loges maçonniques (seconde moitié du XVIII&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle)&quot;, maps 120 and 121 and commentary ''in'' Baratier, Duby &amp; Hildesheimer, ''Atlas historique''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alphand&quot;&gt;Patrice Alphand, &quot;Les Sociétés populaires&quot;, ''La Révolution dans les Basses-Alpes'', Annales de Haute-Provence, bulletin de la société scientifique et littéraire des Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, no 307, 1st term 1989, 108th year, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1789, riots took place as a result of a crisis in wheat production.&lt;ref name=&quot;Révolution11&quot;&gt;''La Révolution dans les Basses-Alpes'', Annales de Haute-Provence, bulletin de la société scientifique et littéraire des Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, no 307, 1st term 1989, 108th year, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In July, the [[Great Fear]] of aristocratic reprisal against the ongoing [[French Revolution]] struck France, arriving in the Barcelonnette area on 31 July 1789 (when the news of the [[storming of the Bastille]] first reached the town) before spreading towards [[Digne]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AHP-c154&quot;&gt;[[Michel Vovelle]], &quot;Les troubles de Provence en 1789&quot;, map 154 and commentary, ''in'' Baratier, Duby &amp; Hildesheimer, ''Atlas historique''&lt;/ref&gt;

This agitation continued in the Ubaye Valley; a new revolt broke out on 14 June,&lt;ref name=&quot;Révolution15&quot;&gt;Annales de Haute-Provence, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and famine was declared in April 1792. The patriotic society of the commune was one of the first 21 created in [[Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]], in spring 1792, by the envoys of the departmental administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alphand296&quot;&gt;Alphand, &quot;Les Sociétés populaires&quot;, pp. 296–301&lt;/ref&gt; Around a third of the male population attended at the club.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alphand320&quot;&gt;Alphand, &quot;Les Sociétés populaires&quot;, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; Another episode of political violence occurred in August 1792.

Barcelonnette was the seat of the District of Barcelonnette from 1790 to 1800.

===Modern history===
[[File:Barcelonnette-Villas mexicaines-IMG 1240.JPG|thumb|left|A ''maison mexicaine'' in Barcelonnette]]
In December 1851, the town was home to a movement of republican resistance towards [[Napoleon III]]'s [[French coup of 1851|coup]]. Though only a minority of the population, the movement rebelled on Sunday 7 December, the day after the news of the coup arrived. Town officials and gendarmes were disarmed and placed in the [[maison d'arrêt]]. A committee of public health was created on 8 December; on 9 December the inhabitants of [[Jausiers]] and its surroundings formed a colony under the direction of general councillor Brès, and Mayor Signoret of [[Saint-Paul-sur-Ubaye]]. This was stopped, however, on 10 December before it could reach Barcelonnette, as the priest of the subprefecture had intervened. On 11 December, several officials escaped and found refuge in [[Maddalena Pass|L'Argentière]] in Piedmont. The arrival of troops on 16 December put a final end to the republican resistance without bloodshed, and 57 insurgents were tried; 38 were condemned to deportation (though several were pardoned in April).

Between 1850 and 1950, Barcelonnette was the source of a wave of [[French immigration to Mexico|emigration to Mexico]]. Among these emigrants was Jean Baptiste Ebrard, founder of the [[Liverpool (store)|Liverpool]] department store chain in Mexico; [[Marcelo Ebrard]], the [[List of heads of government of the Mexican Federal District|head of government of Mexico City]] from 2006 to 2012, is also descended from them. On the edges of Barcelonnette and Jausiers there are several houses and villas of colonial style (known as ''maisons mexicaines''), constructed by emigrants to Mexico who returned to France between 1870 and 1930. A plaque in the town commemorates the deaths of ten Mexican citizens who returned to Barcelonnette to fight in the [[First World War]].

During the [[Second World War]], 26 Jews were arrested in Barcelonnette before being deported.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajpn&quot;&gt;AJPN, &quot;[http://www.ajpn.org/departement-Alpes-de-Haute-Provence-4.html Département des Alpes-de-Haute-Provence en 1939-1945]&quot;, ''Anonymes, Justes et Persécutés durant la période nazie dans les communes de France'', accessed 25 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The 89th ''compagnie de travailleurs étrangers'' (Company of Foreign Workers), consisting of foreigners judged as undesirable by the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] and the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]] and committed to forced labour, was established in Barcelonnette.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajpn-cte&quot;&gt;AJPN, &quot;[http://www.ajpn.org/internement-89e-CTE-574.html 89e CTE]&quot;, ''Anonymes, Justes et Persécutés durant la période nazie dans les communes de France'', accessed 27 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;réfugiés&quot;&gt;Josette Lesueur, Gérard Lesueur, ''Les travailleurs espagnols en Ubaye, 1939-1940'', Barcelonnette, Sabença de la Valeia, 2010, collection &quot;Cahiers de la Vallée&quot;, ISBN 2-908103-54-0, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The 11th Battalion of ''[[Chasseurs alpins]]'' was garrisoned at Barcelonnette between 1948 and 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;11eBCA&quot;&gt;Conseil général des AHP, &quot;Un second souffle pour l’Ubaye?&quot;, ''Le Magazine du conseil général'', no. 70 June 2009, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Barcelonnette is situated in the wide and fertile [[Ubaye Valley]], of which it is the largest town. It lies at an elevation of 1132&amp;nbsp;m (3717&amp;nbsp;ft) on the right bank of the [[Ubaye]] River, and is surrounded by mountains which reach peaks of over 3000&amp;nbsp;m;&lt;ref name=&quot;La vallée de Barcelonnette&quot;&gt;Jacques Levainville, [http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/geo_0003-4010_1907_num_16_87_6924 &quot;La vallée de Barcelonnette&quot;] In: ''Annales de Géographie''. 1907, t. 16, n°87. pp. 223–244. doi : 10.3406/geo.1907.6924&lt;/ref&gt; the tallest of these is the Needle of Chambeyron at 3412&amp;nbsp;m. Barcelonnette is situated 210&amp;nbsp;km from [[Turin]], 91&amp;nbsp;km from [[Nice]] and 68&amp;nbsp;km from [[Gap, Hautes-Alpes|Gap]].&lt;ref&gt;Votre entreprise à Barcelonnette, Les distances, ''barcelonnette.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biodiversity===
As a result of its relief and geographic situation, the Ubaye Valley has an &quot;abundance of plant and animal species&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Au cœur des Alpes « sèches »&quot;&gt;[http://www.mercantour.eu/index.php/Vallee-de-l-Ubaye.html « Au cœur des Alpes « sèches »], ''www.mercantour.eu''&lt;/ref&gt; The fauna is largely constituted of golden eagles, marmots, [[Alpine ibex|ibex]] and vultures, and the flora includes a large proportion of [[larches]], [[Artemisia (genus)|génépis]] and [[Asphodelus ramosus|white asphodels]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Au cœur des Alpes « sèches »&quot;/&gt;

===Climate===
[[Image:Barcelonnette-hiver.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Barcelonnette in winter]]
The [[Ubaye Valley]] has an [[alpine climate]] and winters are harsh as a result of the altitude,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laprovence.com/article/alpes-de-haute-provence « Alpes-de-Haute-Provence »],'' www.laprovence.com'', 19 juin 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but there are only light winds as a result of the relief.&lt;ref name=&quot;Au cœur des Alpes « sèches »&quot;/&gt; There are on average almost 300 days of sun and 700&amp;nbsp;mm of rain per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Au cœur des Alpes « sèches »&quot;/&gt;

===Hazards===
None of the 200 communes of the department is entirely free of seismic risk; the [[canton of Barcelonnette]] is placed in zone 1b (low risk) by the determinist classification of 1991 based on seismic history,&lt;ref name=&quot;ddrm39&quot;&gt;Prefecture of Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, ''[http://www.alpes-de-haute-provence.pref.gouv.fr/pages/themes/defense/securite%20civile/index.html#menu1 Dossier départemental sur les risques majeurs dans les Alpes-de-Haute-Provence]'' (DDRM), 2008, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; and zone 4 (average risk) according to the probabilistic EC8 classification of 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;prim&quot;&gt;Minister of Ecology, Sustainable development, transport and housing, [http://macommune.prim.net/d_commune.php?insee=04019 Notice communale] on the Gaspar database, uploaded 8 July 2011, accessed 30 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The commune is also vulnerable to avalanches, forest fires, floods, and landslides.&lt;ref name=&quot;prim&quot;/&gt; Barcelonnette is also exposed to the possibility of a technological hazard in that road transport of dangerous materials is allowed to pass through on the RD900.&lt;ref name=&quot;ppr&quot;&gt;Prefecture of Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, ''Dossier départemental sur les risques majeurs'', p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ddrm80&quot;&gt;Prefecture of Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, ''Dossier départemental sur les risques majeurs'', p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

The town has been subject to several orders of natural disaster: floods and mudslides in 1994 and 2008, and landslides in 1996 and 1999. The strongest recorded earthquakes in the region occurred on 5&amp;nbsp;April&amp;nbsp;1959, with its epicentre at [[Saint-Paul-sur-Ubaye]] and a recorded intensity of 6.5 at Barcelonnette, and on 17&amp;nbsp;February&amp;nbsp;1947, with its epicentre at [[Prazzo]] over the Italian border.&lt;ref name=&quot;brgm&quot;&gt;[[BRGM]], &quot;[http://www.sisfrance.net/Commune/liste.asp?LOCAL=false&amp;ORDRE=false&amp;INSEE=04019&amp;XMIN=923496&amp;XMAX=963496&amp;YMIN=1919917&amp;YMAX=1959917 Epicentres of distant tremors (greater than 40 km) felt in Barcelonnette]&quot;, ''Sisfrance'', accessed 30 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:Mai 70 drapeau chasseurs 0001.jpg|thumb|''[[Chasseurs alpins]]'' in front of the Barcelonnette town hall in May 1970]]

The old hospital in the town dates from 1717.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collier434&quot;&gt;Raymond Collier, ''La Haute-Provence monumentale et artistique'', p. 434&lt;/ref&gt;
* The old [[gendarmerie]] on Place Manuel was originally constructed to house the subprefecture in 1825 in a [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style, and its façade occupies one entire side of the square. Place Manuel was named after the [[Bourbon Restoration|Restoration]] politician [[Jacques-Antoine Manuel]]; the fountain in the centre of the square contains his image sculpted by [[David d'Angers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Collier533&quot;&gt;Raymond Collier, ''La Haute-Provence monumentale et artistique'', p. 533&lt;/ref&gt;
* The parish church was originally built in the Middle Ages, but was destroyed in the fire of 1628. It was quickly reconstructed between 1634 and 1638, and further between 1643 and 1644. This was later demolished in 1926-27 to allow the construction of the current church, though this still contains the steeple from the 17th-century reconstruction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collier193&quot;&gt;Raymond Collier, ''La Haute-Provence monumentale et artistique'', pp. 193 and 392-393&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Cardinalis tower was constructed in the 14th century as a bell tower for the [[Dominican order|Dominican]] convent, which was founded on the bequest of [[Hugh of Saint-Cher]]. It was damaged in the wars of the 17th century and was rebuilt, though parts still exist from the original construction. It is classed as a [[monument historique]] of France.

The subprefecture has been situated since 1978 in a ''maison mexicaine'', the Villa l'Ubayette, constructed between 1901 and 1903.

In 1471, the community of Barcelonnette (including several surrounding parishes) comprised 421 fires (households). In 1765, it had 6674 inhabitants,&lt;ref name=&quot;AHP&quot;/&gt; but emigration, particularly to Mexico, slowed the town's growth in the period before the [[Second World War]].
