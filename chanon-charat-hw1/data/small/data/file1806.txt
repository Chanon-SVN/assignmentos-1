He is held under the authority of [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]] (AUMF). He was arrested in Pakistan in March 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5322694.stm |title=Americas &amp;#124; Profile: Key US terror suspects |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-02-11 |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zubaydah was arrested in Pakistan in March 2002 and has been in US custody for more than twelve years, four-and-a-half of them in the CIA [[black site|secret prison network]].  He was transferred among prisons in various countries as part of United States [[Rendition (law)|rendition]] program. During the time in CIA custody Zubaydah was extensively interrogated; he was [[waterboarding|water-boarded]] 83 times&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/20/world/20detain.html?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; and subjected to numerous other [[torture]] techniques including [[Nudity#Forced nudity|forced nudity]], [[sleep deprivation]], confinement in small dark boxes, deprivation of solid food, [[stress positions]], and physical assaults.

It was not until September 2006 that these four, together with ten other high-value detainees were transferred to Guantanamo. He and other former [[CIA]] detainees are held in [[Camp Platinum (Guantanamo)#Camp seven/Camp Platinum|Camp 7]], where conditions are the most isolating. At his [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]] in 2007, Zubaydah said he was told that the CIA realized he was not significant.
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;They told me, 'Sorry, we discover that you are not Number 3, not a partner, not even a fighter,' &quot;said Zubaydah, speaking in broken English, according to the new transcript of a [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]] held at the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FinnTate&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/15/AR2009061503045.html?hpid=moreheadlines Peter Finn and Julie Tate, &quot;CIA Says It Misjudged Role of High-Value Detainee Abu Zubaidah, Transcript Shows&quot;], ''Washington Post'', 16 June 2009, accessed 21 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 24 July 2014 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) ordered the Polish government to pay Zubaydah 100,000 [[euro]]s in damages. It also awarded him 30,000 euros to cover his costs. [[Poland]] cooperated with US allowing the CIA to hold and torture Zubaydah on its territory in 2002–2003.

On March 28, 2002, CIA and FBI agents, in conjunction with Pakistani intelligence services, raided several safe houses in Pakistan searching for Zubaydah.&lt;ref name=&quot;GuantanamoFiles&quot;&gt;Andy Worthington, ''The Guantanamo Files,'' Pluto Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TimMcGirk&quot;&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,227584,00.html Tim McGirk, &quot;Anatomy of a Raid&quot;], ''TIME Magazine,'' 8 April 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JohnBurns&quot;&gt;John Burns, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00EFDA123CF937A25757C0A9649C8B63 &quot;A NATION CHALLENGED: THE FUGITIVES, In Pakistan’s Interior, A Troubling Victory in Hunt for Al Qaeda&quot;].

''State of War: The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration,'' 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He was taken by the FBI to a Pakistani hospital nearby and treated for his wounds.

His [[pocket litter]] supposedly contained two [[ATM card|bank cards]] which showed he had access to Saudi and Kuwaiti bank accounts; most al-Qaeda members used the preferred, untraceable [[hawala]] banking.&lt;ref name=&quot;risen&quot;/&gt; According to [[James Risen]], &quot;It is not clear whether an investigation of the cards simply fell through the cracks, or whether they were ignored because no one wanted to know the answers about connections between al Qaeda and important figures in the Middle East – particularly in Saudi Arabia.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;risen&quot;/&gt;  One of Risen's sources chalks up the failure to investigate the cards to incompetence rather than foul play: &quot;The cards were sent back to Washington and were never fully exploited. I think nobody ever looked at them because of incompetence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;risen&quot;/&gt;

When Americans investigated the cards, they worked with &quot;a Muslim financier with a questionable past, and with connections to the Afghan Taliban, al Qaeda, and Saudi intelligence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;risen&quot;/&gt; Risen wrote, &quot;Saudi intelligence officials had seized all of the records related to the card from the Saudi financial institution in question; the records then disappeared. There was no longer any way to trace the money that had gone into the account.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;risen&quot;/&gt;

A search of the safehouse turned up Zubaydah's personal 10,000-page diaries, in which he recorded his thoughts as a young boy, old man, and at his current age. What appears to be split personalities is how Zubaydah was piecing his memories together after his 1992 shrapnel head wound. As part of his therapy to regain his memories, he began recording the diary that detailed his life, emotions, and what people were telling him. He split information into categories, such as what he knew about himself and what people told him, and listed them under different names to distinguish one set from the other. This was later incorrectly interpreted by some analysts reviewing the diary as symptoms of split [[personality disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mayer&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=BlackBanners&gt;{{cite book|last=Soufan|first=Ali|title=The Black Banners}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Spring of 2002, immediately following the capture of Zubaydah, top Bush administration officials, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]], [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]], [[CIA Director]] [[George Tenet]], [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Adviser]] [[Condoleezza Rice]], [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]], and [[US Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]] discussed at length whether or not the CIA could legally use harsh techniques against him.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarkMazetti&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/25/washington/25detain.html Mark Mazzetti, &quot;Bush Aides Linked to Talks on Interrogations&quot;], ''New York Times'', September 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BushAwareInterrogations&quot;&gt;[http://abclocal.go.com/kfsn/story?section=news/national_world&amp;id=6076727 &quot;Bush aware of advisers’ interrogation talks&quot;], ABC News, April 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Condoleezza Rice specifically mentioned the [[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape|SERE]] program during the meeting, saying, “I recall being told that U.S. military personnel were subjected to training to certain physical and psychological interrogation techniques...”&lt;ref name=&quot;MarkMazetti&quot;/&gt;

==Interrogation of Zubaydah==

{{Main|Interrogation of Abu Zubaydah}}
Zubaydah was interrogated by two separate interrogation teams: the first from the FBI and one from the CIA. [[Ali Soufan]], one of the FBI interrogators, later testified in 2009 on these issues to the Senate Committee that was investigating detainee treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;SoufanOpEd&quot;/&gt; Soufan, who witnessed part of the CIA interrogation of Zubaydah, described his treatment under the CIA as [[torture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SoufanOpEd&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/opinion/23soufan.html Ali Soufan, &quot;My Tortured Decision&quot;], ''New York Times'', April 22, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The International Committee of the Red Cross and others later reached the same conclusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;SoufanNewsweek&quot;&gt;Michael Isikoff [http://www.newsweek.com/id/195089 &quot;We Could Have Done This the Right Way&quot;], ''Newsweek,'' 25 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SoufanTestimony&quot;&gt;[http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=3842&amp;wit_id=7906 &quot;Congressional Testimony of Ali Soufan, May 13, 2009&quot;], Congressional Testimony, 13 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ICRC&quot;&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/icrc-report.pdf ''Report on the Treatment of Fourteen &quot;High Value Detainees&quot; in CIA Custody''], International Committee of the Red Cross, February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; While in CIA custody, Zubaydah lost his left eye.&lt;ref name=&quot;vox.com&quot;/&gt;

Because of the urgency felt about the interrogation of Zubaydah, the CIA had consulted with the president about how to proceed. The General Counsel of the CIA asked for a legal opinion from the [[Office of Legal Counsel]], Department of Justice about what was permissible during interrogation.

==August 1, 2002 Memo==

{{main|Torture Memos}}
It was later discovered that in August 2002, the Office of Legal Counsel, [[Jay Bybee]] and his assistant [[John Yoo]] drafted what became known as the first [[Torture Memo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;August02TortureMemoReleased&quot;&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/07/24/cia.torture/index.html ''Previously Secret Torture Memo Released''] CNN.com, July 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Addressed to CIA acting General Counsel [[John A.

==2003 Transfer to Guantanamo==

In August 2010 the Associated Press reported that the CIA, having concluded its agents had gotten most of the information from Zubaydah, in September 2003 transferred him and three other high-value detainees to Guantanamo. They were held at what was informally known as &quot;[[Strawberry Fields (Guantanamo)|Strawberry Fields]],&quot; a secret camp within the complex built especially for former CIA detainees. Concerned that a pending Supreme Court decision, ''[[Rasul v. Bush]]'' (2004), might go against the Bush administration and require providing the prisoners with counsel and having to reveal data about them, on March 27, 2004 the CIA took the four men back into custody and transported them out of Guantanamo to one of their secret sites.&lt;ref name=AssociatedPress-2010-08-07&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the moves were all kept secret.

In February 2007, the International Committee of the Red Cross concluded a report on the treatment of &quot;14 high-value detainees,&quot; who had been held by the CIA and, after September 2006, by the military at Guantanamo.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICRC&quot;/&gt; The ICRC described the twelve [[enhanced interrogation techniques]] covered in the OLC memos to the CIA: [[waterboarding|suffocation by water]] (which is described as &quot;torture&quot; by numerous US officials&lt;ref name=mayer/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AmyGoodman&quot;&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2008/7/18/the_dark_side_jane_mayer_on Amy Goodman, &quot;'The Dark Side': Jane Mayer on the Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals, Interview Transcript&quot;], ''Democracy Now,'' 18 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;), prolonged stress standing position, beatings by use of a collar, beating and kicking, confinement in a box, prolonged nudity, sleep deprivation, exposure to cold temperature, prolonged shackling, threats of ill-treatment, forced shaving, and deprivation/restricted provision of solid food.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICRC&quot;/&gt; Zubaydah was the only detainee of the 14 interviewed who had been subjected to all 12 of these interrogation techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICRC&quot;/&gt; He was also the only one of the 14 detainees to be put into close confinement.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICRC&quot;/&gt;

==May 30, 2005 Memo==

The final memo mentioned Zubaydah several times. It claimed that due to the enhanced interrogation techniques, Zubaydah &quot;provided significant information on two operatives, [including] José Padilla[,] who planned to build and detonate a '[[dirty bomb]]' in the Washington DC area.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;May302005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt; This claim is strongly disputed by Ali Soufan, the [[FBI interrogator]] who first interrogated Zubaydah following his capture, by traditional means. He said the most valuable information was gained before torture was used. Other intelligence officers have also disputed that claim.&lt;ref name=mayer/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SoufanOpEd&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SoufanNewsweek&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SoufanTestimony&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MazettiAndJohnston&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/washington/09zubaydah.html?_r=1&amp;ref=world&amp;oref=slogin Mark Mazzetti and David Johnston ''Inquiry Begins Into Destruction of Tapes'']. ''New York Times'', December 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Soufan, when asked in 2009 by Senator [[Sheldon Whitehouse]] during a Congressional hearing if the memo was incorrect, testified that it was.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarkBenjamin&quot;&gt;[http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2009/05/14/torture/ Mark Benjamin, &quot;Soufan: CIA torture actually hindered our intelligence gathering&quot;], ''Salon,'' May 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The memo noted that not all of the waterboarding sessions were necessary for Zubaydah, since the on-scene interrogation team determined he had stopped producing actionable intelligence.&lt;ref name=&quot;May302005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt; The memo reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This is not to say that the interrogation program has worked perfectly. According to the IG Report, the CIA, at least initially, could not always distinguish detainees who had information but were successfully resisting interrogation from those who did not actually have the information. See IG Report at 83–85. On at least one occasion, this may have resulted in what might be deemed in retrospect to have been the unnecessary use of enhanced techniques. On that occasion, although the on-scene interrogation team judged Zubaydah to be compliant, elements within CIA Headquarters still believed he was withholding information. See id at 84. At the direction of CIA Headquarters, interrogators therefore used the waterboard one more time on Zubaydah.&lt;ref name=&quot;May302005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[John E. McLaughlin|John McLaughlin]], former acting CIA director, stated in 2006, &quot;I totally disagree with the view that the capture of Zubaydah was unimportant. Zubaydah was woven through all of the intelligence prior to 9/11 that signaled a major attack was coming, and his capture yielded a great deal of important information.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SuskindBlitzer&quot;&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0606/20/sitroom.02.html ''Transcript for THE SITUATION ROOM with Wolf Blitzer''] CNN, June 20, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2007 memoir, former [[Director of Central Intelligence|CIA Director]] [[George Tenet]] writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A published report in 2006 contended that Zubaydah was mentally unstable and that the administration had overstated his importance. Baloney. Zubaydah had been at the crossroads of many al-Qa'ida operations and was in position to – and did – share critical information with his interrogators. Apparently, the source of the rumor that Zubaydah was unbalanced was his personal diary, in which he adopted various personas. From that shaky perch, some junior Freudians leapt to the conclusion that Zubaydah had multiple personalities. In fact, Agency psychiatrists eventually determined that in his diary he was using a sophisticated literary device to express himself. And, boy, did he express himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;GeorgeTenet&quot;&gt;George Tenet, ''At the Center of the Storm: My Years at the CIA,'' HarperCollins, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Intelligence Obtained from Zubaydah and Its Aftereffects==

Zubaydah's capture was touted as the biggest of the War on Terror until that of [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]].&lt;ref name=&quot;9/11MastermindNabbed&quot;&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/03/02/terror/main542459.shtml ''Alleged 9-11 Mastermind Nabbed''] CBS News, March 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The director of the FBI stated Zubaydah’s capture would help deter future attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewsSummary&quot;&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE5DB1E3AF937A35757C0A9649C8B63 ''NEWS SUMMARY: Arrest May Deter Attacks'']. ''New York Times'', April 4, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech in 2006, President Bush claimed that Zubaydah revealed useful intelligence when enhanced interrogation was used, including identification of two important suspects and information that allegedly helped foil a terrorist attack on American soil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bush092006Speech&quot;/&gt; These claims directly conflict with the reports of the F.B.I. agents who first interrogated Zubaydah. He gave them the names before torture was used, and the third piece of information came from other sources who had been receiving crucial pieces of information from him without the use of harsher techniques,&lt;ref name=mayer/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SoufanOpEd&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SoufanNewsweek&quot;/&gt; as well as other government officials.&lt;ref name=&quot;FinnAndWarrick&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesProfileZubaydah&quot;&gt;[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/z/abu_zubaydah/index.html &quot;Abu Zubaydah&quot;], ''New York Times'', April 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iraq War (2003)==

The Bush administration relied on some of Zubaydah's claims in justifying the invasion of Iraq. U.S. officials stated that the allegations that Iraq and al-Qaeda were linked in the training of people on chemical weapons came from Zubaydah.&lt;ref name=&quot;HutchesonAndKuhnhenn&quot;&gt;[http://www2.jsonline.com/news/nat/sep02/83149.asp Ron Hutcheson and James Kuhnhenn, &quot;Iraq deal with Congress nears, Bush says&quot;], ''Milwaukee Journal Sentinel,'' September 26, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BushSaysIraq&quot;&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7430560_ITM &quot;Bush Says He and Congress Will Band Together on Iraq; Capitol Hill Still Sour&quot;], ''Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News,'' September 27, 2002 (Access My Library Link, requires free membership)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TorturedLie&quot;&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/andrew_sullivan/article6168270.ece [[Andrew Sullivan]], &quot;One tortured lie: that's all it took for war&quot;], ''The Sunday Times,'' April 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The officials noted there was no independent verification of his claims.&lt;ref name=&quot;HutchesonAndKuhnhenn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BushSaysIraq&quot;/&gt;

The U.S. Government included statements made by Zubaydah in regards to al Qaeda’s ability to obtain a dirty bomb to show a link between Iraq and al Qaeda.&lt;ref name=&quot;FritzUmbach&quot;&gt;[http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2006/04/13/document_dump/ Fritz Umbach, &quot;Bush’s bogus document dump&quot;], ''Salon,'' 13 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Senate Intelligence Committee report of 2004, Zubaydah said that &quot;he had heard that an important al Qaeda associate, [[Abu Musab al Zarqawi]], and others had good relationships with Iraqi intelligence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;StephenHayes&quot;&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/004/803czhfn.asp?pg=2 Stephen F. Hayes, &quot;The Rice Stuff?&quot;], ''The Daily Standard,'' October 20, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; But the year before in June 2003, Zubaydah and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed were reported as saying there was no link between [[Saddam Hussein]] and [[al Qaeda]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DiamondAndNichols&quot;&gt;John Diamond and Bill Nichols [http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2003-06-08-cia-usat_x.htm &quot;CIA in spotlight over reports leading to war&quot;], 8 June 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JamesRisen&quot;&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE4D61539F93AA35755C0A9659C8B63 James Risen, &quot;THREATS AND RESPONSES: C.I.A.; Captives Deny Qaeda Worked With Baghdad&quot;], ''The New York Times'', 9 June 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Senate Armed Services Committee 2008 report on the abuses of detainees, the Bush administration was described as having applied pressure to interrogators to find a link between Iraq and Al-Qaeda prior to the Iraq War.&lt;ref name=&quot;BanalityOfBush&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/26/opinion/26rich.html Frank Rich, &quot;The Banality of Bush White House Evil&quot;], ''The New York Times'', 25 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Major Paul Burney, a psychiatrist with the United States Army, said to the committee, &quot;while we were [at Guantanamo] a large part of the time we were focused on trying to establish a link between Al Qaeda and Iraq and we were not being successful.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BanalityOfBush&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmedServicesDetaineeReport&quot;&gt;[http://armed-services.senate.gov/Publications/Detainee%20Report%20Final_April%2022%202009.pdf Senate Armed Services Committee, ''Inquiry Into the Treatment of Detainees in U.S. Custody''], Senate Armed Services Committee, 20 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He said that higher-ups were &quot;frustrated&quot; and applied &quot;more and more pressure to resort to measures that might produce more immediate results.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BanalityOfBush&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmedServicesDetaineeReport&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EdBrayton&quot;&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2009/05/the_lies_on_torture_just_keep.php Ed Brayton, &quot;The Lies on Torture Just Keep Coming&quot;], ''Science'' Blogs, 4 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonel Lawrence B. Wilkerson, the former chief of staff for former Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] has said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Likewise, what I have learned is that as the administration authorized harsh interrogation in April and May of 2002—well before the Justice Department had rendered any legal opinion—its principal priority for intelligence was not aimed at pre-empting another terrorist attack on the U.S. but discovering a smoking gun linking Iraq and al-Qa'ida.

So furious was this effort that on one particular detainee, even when the interrogation team had reported to Cheney's office that their detainee &quot;was compliant&quot; (meaning the team recommended no more torture), the VP's office ordered them to continue the enhanced methods. The detainee had not revealed any al-Qa'ida-Baghdad contacts yet. This ceased only after Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, under waterboarding in Egypt, &quot;revealed&quot; such contacts. Of course, later we learned that al-Libi revealed these contacts only to get the torture to stop.&lt;ref name=ArmedServicesDetaineeReport/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Concerns==

In 2004 media coverage of Abu Zubaydah began listing him as a &quot;disappeared” prisoner,&quot; claiming he had no access to the International Red Cross.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReedBrody&quot;&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/10/11/opinion/edbrody.php Reed Brody ''Prisoners who disappear'']. ''International Herald Tribune'', October 12, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2005, the CIA was reported as uncomfortable keeping Zubaydah in indefinite custody.&lt;ref name=&quot;JehlAndJohnstonAndLewis&quot;&gt;Douglas Jehl, David Johnston, and Neil A. Lewis [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-105455175.html &quot;CIA called uncomfortable with role on war prisoners Holding terror suspects raises concerns&quot;], ''International Herald Tribune'', February 16, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Less than 18 months later, Zubaydah and the thirteen other high-value detainees who had been in secret CIA custody were transferred to the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BartonGellman&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/19/AR2006061901211.html Barton Gellman, &quot;The Shadow War, In a Surprising New Light&quot;], ''Washington Post'', 20 June 2006, accessed 20 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

After his transfer, the CIA denied access to Zubaydah. In 2008, the Office of the [[Inspector General]], Department of Justice, complained that it had been prevented from seeing him, although it was conducting a study of the US treatment of its detainees.&lt;ref name=&quot;EmmaSchwartz&quot;&gt;[http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/2008/05/20/justice-dept-inspector-general-claims-cia-hampered-its-investigation.html Emma Schwartz, &quot;Justice Dept. Inspector General Claims CIA Hampered its Investigation&quot;], ''U.S. News &amp; World Report,'' 20 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zubaydah's Mental Health==

Some people are concerned about Zubaydah's mental stability and how that has affected information he has given to interrogators. [[Ron Suskind]] noted in his book, ''[[The One Percent Doctrine]]: Deep Inside America's Pursuit of Its Enemies Since 9/11'' (2006), that Zubaydah was mentally ill or disabled due to a severe head injury. He described Zubaydah as keeping a diary &quot;in the voice of three people: Hani 1, Hani 2, and Hani 3&quot;—a boy, a young man and a middle-aged alter ego.&lt;ref name=&quot;SuskindOnePercent&quot;/&gt; Zubaydah's diaries spanned ten years and recorded in numbing detail &quot;what he ate, or wore, or trifling things [people] said.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EggenPincusFBICIADebate&quot;/&gt; Dan Coleman, then the FBI's top al-Qaeda analyst, told a senior bureau official, &quot;This guy is insane, certifiable, split personality.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SuskindOnePercent&quot;/&gt; According to Suskind, this judgment was &quot;echoed at the top of CIA and was briefed to the President and Vice President.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SuskindOnePercent&quot;/&gt; Coleman stated Zubaydah was a &quot;safehouse keeper&quot; with mental problems, who &quot;claimed to know more about al-Qaeda and its inner workings than he really did.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EggenPincusFBICIADebate&quot;/&gt;

Joseph Margulies, Zubaydah's co-counsel, wrote in an OpEd in the ''LA Times'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Partly as a result of injuries he suffered while he was fighting the communists in Afghanistan, partly as a result of how those injuries were exacerbated by the CIA and partly as a result of his extended isolation, Zubaydah's mental grasp is slipping away. Today, he suffers blinding headaches and has permanent brain damage. He has an excruciating sensitivity to sounds, hearing what others do not. The slightest noise drives him nearly insane. In the last two years alone, he has experienced about 200 seizures. Already, he cannot picture his mother's face or recall his father's name. Gradually, his past, like his future, eludes him.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarguliesZubaydah&quot;&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-margulies30-2009apr30,0,3309097.story Joseph Margulies, &quot;Abu Zubaydah's suffering&quot;], ''Los Angeles Times'', April 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legal Status==

President Bush referred to Zubaydah in a speech to Congress September 2006 requesting a bill to authorize [[military commissions]], following the [[US Supreme Court]] ruling in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]''(2006) that held the tribunals as formulated by the executive branch were unconstitutional. Congress rapidly passed legislation that was signed by the president.&lt;ref name=&quot;WarrenRichey&quot;&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0915/p01s02-usju.html?s=widep Warren Richey, &quot;‘Alternative’ CIA tactics complicate Padilla case&quot;], ''Christian Science Monitor,'' September 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than one month after Zubaydah’s capture, Justice Department officials said Zubaydah was &quot;a near-ideal candidate for a tribunal trial.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NeilALewis&quot;&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E2DE103FF932A15757C0A9649C8B63 Neail A. Lewis ''A NATION CHALLENGED: THE DETAINEES; U.S. Is Seeking Basis to Charge War Detainees'']. ''New York Times'', April 21, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Several months later in 2002, US officials said there was &quot;no rush&quot; to try Zubaydah via military commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;FrankDavies&quot;&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-8932707_ITM Frank Davies, &quot;U.S. readies tribunals for terrorism trials&quot;], ''The Miami Herald,'' December 26, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Government has not officially charged Zubaydah with any crimes.&lt;ref name=&quot;CurrentChargeSheets&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissions.html Department of Defense Military Commissions Cases Website], April 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==European Court of Human Rights Decision==

On 24 July 2014 the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) ruled that [[Poland]] had violated the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] when it cooperated with US allowing the CIA to hold and torture Zubaydah and [[Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri]] on its territory in 2002–2003. The court ordered the Polish government to pay each of the men 100,000 [[euro]]s in damages. It also awarded Zubaydah 30,000 euros to cover his costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-28460628|title=Poland 'helped in CIA rendition', European Court rules|work=BBC News|accessdate=October 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.wsj.com/articles/eu-court-rules-against-poland-in-cia-rendition-case-1406193988|title=European Court Assails Poland Over Role in CIA 'Black Sites'|author=Gabriele Steinhauser and Jess Bravin|date=July 25, 2014|work=WSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
