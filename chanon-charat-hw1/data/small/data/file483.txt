However, that distance varies as the Earth orbits the Sun, from a maximum ([[aphelion]]) to a minimum ([[perihelion]]) and back again once a year. Originally, each distance was measured through observation, and the au was defined as their average, half the sum of the maximum and minimum, making the unit a kind of medium measure for Earth-to-Sun distance. It is now defined as exactly {{val|149597870700}} metres (about 150 million km, or 93 million miles).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | contribution = RESOLUTION B2 on the re-definition of the astronomical unit of length | title = RESOLUTION B2 | editor-last = International Astronomical Union | publisher = [[International Astronomical Union]] | place = Beijing, Kina | date = 31 August 2012 | contribution-url = http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU2012_English.pdf | quote = The XXVIII General Assembly of International Astronomical Union recommends [adopted] that the astronomical unit be re-defined to be a conventional unit of length equal to exactly 149,597,870,700 meters, in agreement with the value adopted in IAU 2009 Resolution B2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The astronomical unit is used primarily as a convenient yardstick for measuring distances within the [[Solar System]]. However, it is also a fundamental component in the definition of another critical unit of astronomical length, the [[parsec]].

==Development of unit definition==
{{See also|Earth's orbit}}

The Earth's orbit around the Sun is shaped like an [[ellipse]]. The [[semi-major axis]] of that ellipse is half of a straight line that crosses the orbit at its extremes, the points of aphelion and perihelion, passing through the center of the sun along its way. Since ellipses are well-understood shapes, measuring the points of its extremes defined the exact shape mathematically, and made possible calculations for the entire orbit as well as predictions based upon observation. In addition, it mapped out exactly the largest straight-line distance the earth traverses over the course of a year, defining times and places for observing the largest [[parallax]] effects (apparent shifts of position) in nearby stars. Knowing the earth's shift and a star's shift enabled the star's distance to be calculated. But all measurements are subject to some degree of error or uncertainty, and the uncertainties in the length of the au only increased uncertainties in the stellar distances. Improvements in precision have always been a key to improving astronomical understanding. Throughout the twentieth century, measurements became increasingly precise and sophisticated, and ever more dependent upon accurate observation of the effects described by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] [[theory of relativity]] and upon the mathematical tools it used.

Improving measurements were continually checked and cross-checked by means of our understanding of the laws of [[celestial mechanics]], which govern the motions of objects in space. The expected positions and distances of objects at an established time are calculated (in au) from these laws, and assembled into a collection of data called an [[ephemeris]]. [[NASA|NASA's]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] provides one of several ephemeris computation services.&lt;ref name=Horizons&gt;{{citation |title=HORIZONS System |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons |work=Solar system dynamics |date=4 January 2005 |accessdate=16 January 2012 |publisher=NASA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, in order to establish a yet more precise measure for the au, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) formally adopted [[IAU (1976) System of Astronomical Constants|a new definition]]. While directly based on the then-best available observational measurements, the definition was recast in terms of the then-best mathematical derivations from celestial mechanics and planetary ephemerides. It stated that &quot;the astronomical unit of length is that length (''A'') for which the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]] (''k'') takes the value {{val|0.01720209895}} when the units of measurement are the astronomical units of length, mass and time&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAU76&quot;&gt;Resolution No. 10 of the [http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU1976_French.pdf XVIth General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union], Grenoble, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Trümper&quot;&gt;{{Citation |title= Astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology — Volume VI/4B ''Solar System''|url=http://books.google.com/?id=wgydrPWl6XkC&amp;pg=RA1-PA4 |page=4 |date=2009 |author=H.

Subsequent explorations of the Solar System by [[space probe]]s made it possible to obtain precise measurements of the relative positions of the [[Solar System#Inner planets|inner planets]] and other objects by means of [[radar]] and [[telemetry]]. As with all radar measurements, these rely on measuring the time taken for [[photons]] to be reflected from an object. Since all photons move at the [[speed of light]] in vacuum, a fundamental constant of the universe, the distance of an object from the probe is basically the product of the speed of light and the measured time. For precision though, the calculations require adjustment for things such as the motions of the probe and object while the photons are in transit. In addition, the measurement of the time itself must be translated to a standard scale that accounts for relativistic time dilation. Comparison of the ephemeris positions with time measurements expressed in the [[Barycentric Dynamical Time|TDB]] scale leads to a value for the speed of light in astronomical units per day (of 86,400 seconds). By 2009, the IAU had updated its standard measures to reflect improvements, and calculated the speed of light at {{val|173.1446326847|(69)|u=au/day}} TDB.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://asa.usno.navy.mil/SecK/2009/Astronomical_Constants_2009.pdf 2009 Selected Astronomical Constants]&quot; in {{citation|title=The Astronomical Almanac Online|url=http://asa.usno.navy.mil/|publisher=[[United States Naval Observatory|USNO]]–[[United Kingdom Hydrographic Office|UKHO]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in 1983, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) modified the [[International System of Units]] (SI, or &quot;modern&quot; metric system) to make the metre independent of physical objects entirely, because measurement errors had become too large for the prototype metre to be useful any more. Instead, it was redefined in terms of the speed of light in vacuum, which could be independently determined at need. The speed of light could then be expressed exactly as ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = {{val|299792458|u=m/s}}, a standard also adopted by the [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service|IERS]] numerical standards.&lt;ref name=IERS&gt;{{citation |title=Table 1.1: IERS numerical standards |work=IERS technical note no. 36: General definitions and numerical standards |author=Gérard Petit and Brian Luzum, eds. {{clarify|date=November 2013}} |url=ftp://tai.bipm.org/iers/conv2010/chapter1/tn36_c1.pdf |publisher=[[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] |date=2010}} For complete document see {{citation |title=IERS Conventions (2010): IERS technical note no. 36 |author=Gérard Petit and Brian Luzum, eds. {{clarify|date=November 2013}} |isbn=978-3-89888-989-6 |url=http://www.iers.org/nn_11216/IERS/EN/Publications/TechnicalNotes/tn36.html |publisher=International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this definition and the 2009 IAU standard, the time for light to traverse an au is found to be τ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = {{val|499.0047838061|0.00000001}} seconds, more than 8 minutes.

This estimate was still derived from observation and measurements subject to error, and based in techniques that did not yet standardize all relativistic effects, and thus were not constant for all observers. In 2012, finding that the equalization of relativity alone would make the definition overly complex, the IAU simply used the 2009 estimate to redefine the astronomical unit as a conventional unit of length directly tied to the metre (exactly {{val|149597870700|u=m}}) and assigned it the official symbol au.&lt;ref name=Captaine/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nature2012&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.nature.com/news/the-astronomical-unit-gets-fixed-1.11416 | title = The astronomical unit gets fixed: Earth–Sun distance changes from slippery equation to single number. | author = Geoff Brumfiel | date = 14 September 2012 | accessdate = 14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new definition also recognizes as a consequence that the au unit is now to play a role of reduced importance, limited in its use to that of a convenience in some applications.&lt;ref name=Captaine/&gt;

==Usage==
With the definitions used before 2012, the astronomical unit was dependent on the [[heliocentric gravitational constant]], that is the product of the [[gravitational constant]] ''G'' and the [[solar mass]] {{Solar mass|link=y}}. Neither ''G'' nor {{Solar mass}} can be measured to high accuracy in SI units, but the value of their product is known very precisely from observing the relative positions of planets ([[Kepler's Third Law]] expressed in terms of Newtonian gravitation). Only the product is required to calculate planetary positions for an [[ephemeris]], which explains why ephemerides are calculated in astronomical units and not in SI units.

The calculation of ephemerides also requires a consideration of the effects of [[general relativity]]. In particular, time intervals measured on the surface of the Earth ([[terrestrial time]], TT) are not constant when compared to the motions of the planets: the terrestrial second (TT) appears to be longer in Northern Hemisphere winter and shorter in Northern Hemisphere summer when compared to the &quot;planetary second&quot; (conventionally measured in [[barycentric dynamical time]], TDB). This is because the distance between the Earth and the Sun is not fixed (it varies between {{val|0.9832898912}} and {{val|1.0167103335|u=au}}) and, when the Earth is closer to the Sun ([[perihelion]]), the Sun's gravitational field is stronger and the Earth is moving faster along its [[Earth's orbit|orbital path]]. As the metre is defined in terms of the second, and the speed of light is constant for all observers, the terrestrial metre appears to change in length compared to the &quot;planetary metre&quot; on a periodic basis.

The metre is defined to be a unit of [[proper length]], but the SI definition does not specify the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] to be used in determining it. Indeed, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) notes that &quot;its definition applies only within a spatial extent sufficiently small that the effects of the non-uniformity of the gravitational field can be ignored.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{SIbrochure8th|pages=166–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the metre is undefined for the purposes of measuring distances within the Solar System. The 1976 definition of the astronomical unit was incomplete, in particular because it does not specify the [[frame of reference]] in which time is to be measured, but proved practical for the calculation of ephemerides: a fuller definition that is consistent with general relativity was proposed,&lt;ref name=&quot;Huang&quot;&gt;{{citation|author=Huang, T.-Y.; Han, C.-H.; Yi, Z.-H.; Xu, B.-X.|date=1995|title=What is the astronomical unit of length?|bibcode=1995A&amp;A...298..629H|journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics|Astron. Astrophys.]]|volume=298|pages=629–33|last2=Han|last3=Yi|last4=Xu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;vigorous debate&quot; ensued &lt;ref name=Dodd&gt;{{citation |title=Using SI Units in Astronomy |author=Richard Dodd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2011 |page=76 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UC_1_804BXgC&amp;pg=PA76 |chapter=§6.2.3: Astronomical unit: ''Definition of the astronomical unit, future versions'' |isbn=0-521-76917-5}} and also p. 91, ''Summary and recommendations''.&lt;/ref&gt; until in August 2012 the [[International Astronomical Union]] adopted the current definition of 1 astronomical unit = {{val|149597870700}} [[metre]]s.

The au is too small for interstellar distances, where the [[parsec]] is commonly used. See the article [[cosmic distance ladder]]. The [[light year]] is often used in popular works, but is not an approved non-SI unit.&lt;ref name=Dodd1&gt;See, for example, the work cited above: {{citation |title=Using SI Units in Astronomy |author=Richard Dodd |page=82 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UC_1_804BXgC&amp;pg=PA82 |chapter=§6.2.8: Light year |isbn=0-521-76917-5|date=2011-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to [[Archimedes]] in the ''[[Sand Reckoner|Sandreckoner]]'' (2.1), [[Aristarchus of Samos]] estimated the distance to the Sun to be {{val|10000}} times the Earth's radius (the true value is about {{val|23000}}).&lt;ref name=Gomez&gt;Gomez, A. G. (2013) [http://www.authorhouse.co.uk/Bookstore/BookDetail.aspx?BookId=SKU-000625467 '' Aristarchos of Samos, the Polymath''] AuthorHouse, ISBN 9781481789493.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the book ''[[On the Sizes and Distances of the Sun and Moon]]'', which has long been ascribed to Aristarchus, says that he calculated the distance to the Sun to be between 18 and 20 times the [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|distance to the Moon]], whereas the true ratio is about 389.174. The latter estimate was based on the angle between the [[Lunar phase|half moon]] and the Sun, which he estimated as 87° (the true value being close to 89.853°). Depending on the distance Van Helden assumes Aristarchus used for the distance to the Moon, his calculated distance to the Sun would fall between 380 and {{val|1520}} Earth radii.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Van Helden|first=Albert|title=Measuring the Universe: Cosmic Dimensions from Aristarchus to Halley|place=Chicago|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=1985|pages=5–9|isbn=0-226-84882-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in the ''[[Preparation for the Gospel|Praeparatio Evangelica]]'' (Book XV, Chapter 53), [[Eratosthenes]] found the distance to the Sun to be &quot;σταδιων μυριαδας τετρακοσιας και οκτωκισμυριας&quot; (literally &quot;of ''stadia'' [[myriad]]s 400 and {{val|80000}}&quot; but with the additional note that in the Greek text the [[Agreement (linguistics)|grammatical agreement]] is between ''myriads'' (not ''stadia'') on the one hand and both ''400'' and ''{{val|80000}}'' on the other, as in Greek, unlike English, all three or all four if one were to include ''stadia'', words are [[Inflection|inflected]]). This has been translated either as {{val|4080000}} ''[[stadion (unit of length)|stadia]]'' (1903 translation by [[Edwin Hamilton Gifford]]), or as {{val|804000000}} ''stadia'' (edition of [[Édouard des Places]], dated 1974–1991). Using the Greek stadium of 185 to 190 metres,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Engels|first=Donald|date=1985|title=The Length of Eratosthenes' Stade|journal=Am. J.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the former translation comes to a far too low {{val|755000|u=km}} whereas the second translation comes to 148.7 to 152.8 million kilometres (accurate within 2%).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=D.|last=Rawlins|date=2008|title=Eratosthenes' large earth and tiny universe|journal=DIO|volume=14|pages=3–12|url=http://www.dioi.org/vols/we0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hipparchus]] also gave an estimate of the distance of the Sun from the Earth, quoted by [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]] as equal to 490 Earth radii. According to the conjectural reconstructions of [[Noel Swerdlow]] and [[G. J. Toomer]], this was derived from his assumption of a &quot;least perceptible&quot; solar parallax of 7 arc minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1007/BF00329826|title=Hipparchus on the distances of the sun and moon | journal=Archive for the History of Exact Sciences | volume = 14 | issue = 2 |pages = 126&amp;ndash;142 date = 1974 | last1 = Toomer | first = G.

A Chinese mathematical treatise, the ''[[Zhou Bi Suan Jing|Zhoubi suanjing]]'' (c. 1st century BCE), shows how the distance to the Sun can be computed geometrically, using the different lengths of the noontime shadows observed at three places {{val|1000}} [[Li (length)|li]] apart and the assumption that the Earth is flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=G.

In the 2nd century CE, [[Ptolemy]] estimated the mean distance of the Sun as {{val|1210}} times the [[Earth radius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Bernard R.|last=Goldstein|title=The Arabic Version of Ptolemy's ''Planetary Hypotheses''|journal=Trans.

He then derived a maximum lunar distance of {{frac|64|1|6}} Earth radii. Because of cancelling errors in his parallax figure, his theory of the Moon's orbit, and other factors, this figure was approximately correct.&lt;ref name=vh1619&gt;pp. 16–19, van Helden 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 251, ''Ptolemy's Almagest'',
translated and annotated by G. J. Toomer, London: Duckworth, 1984, ISBN 0-7156-1588-2&lt;/ref&gt; He then measured the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon and concluded that the apparent diameter of the Sun was equal to the apparent diameter of the Moon at the Moon's greatest distance, and from records of lunar eclipses, he estimated this apparent diameter, as well as the apparent diameter of the shadow cone of the Earth traversed by the Moon during a lunar eclipse. Given these data, the distance of the Sun from the Earth can be trigonometrically computed to be {{val|1210}} Earth radii. This gives a ratio of solar to lunar distance of approximately 19, matching Aristarchus's figure. Although Ptolemy's procedure is theoretically workable, it is very sensitive to small changes in the data, so much so that changing a measurement by a few percent can make the solar distance infinite.&lt;ref name=vh1619/&gt;

After Greek astronomy was transmitted to the medieval Islamic world, astronomers made some changes to Ptolemy's cosmological model, but did not greatly change his estimate of the Earth–Sun distance. For example, in his introduction to Ptolemaic astronomy, [[al-Farghānī]] gave a mean solar distance of {{val|1170}} Earth radii, while in his ''[[zij]]'', [[al-Battānī]] used a mean solar distance of {{val|1108}} Earth radii. Subsequent astronomers, such as [[al-Bīrūnī]], used similar values.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 29–33, van Helden 1985&lt;/ref&gt; Later in Europe, [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]] and [[Tycho Brahe]] also used comparable figures ({{val|1142}} and {{val|1150}} Earth radii), and so Ptolemy's approximate Earth–Sun distance survived through the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 41–53, van Helden 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes Kepler]] was the first to realize that Ptolemy's estimate must be significantly too low (according to Kepler, at least by a factor of three) in his ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'' (1627). [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] allowed astronomers to calculate the relative distances of the planets from the Sun, and rekindled interest in measuring the absolute value for the Earth (which could then be applied to the other planets). The invention of the [[telescope]] allowed far more accurate measurements of angles than is possible with the naked eye. Flemish astronomer [[Godefroy Wendelin]] repeated Aristarchus' measurements in 1635, and found that Ptolemy's value was too low by a factor of at least eleven.

A somewhat more accurate estimate can be obtained by observing the [[transit of Venus]].&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;

An extended historical discussion of this method is provided by {{citation |title=Quest for the astronomical unit |author =Trudy E Bell |url=http://www.tbp.org/pages/publications/bent/features/su04bell.pdf |work=The Bent of Tau Beta Pi, Summer 2004, p. 20 |accessdate=16 January 2012}}

&lt;/ref&gt; By measuring the transit in two different locations, one can accurately calculate the [[parallax]] of Venus and from the relative distance of the Earth and Venus from the Sun, the [[Parallax#Solar parallax|solar parallax]] ''α'' (which cannot be measured directly&lt;ref name=&quot;Weaver&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Weaver|first=Harold F.|title=The Solar Parallax|bibcode=1943ASPL....4..144W|date=1943|journal=Astronomical Society of the Pacific Leaflets|volume=4|pages=144–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;). [[Jeremiah Horrocks]] had attempted to produce an estimate based on [[Transit of Venus, 1639|his observation of the 1639 transit]] (published in 1662), giving a solar parallax of 15 [[arcsecond]]s, similar to Wendelin's figure. The solar parallax is related to the Earth–Sun distance as measured in [[Earth radius|Earth radii]] by
:&lt;math&gt;A = {\cot\alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;
The smaller the solar parallax, the greater the distance between the Sun and the Earth: a solar parallax of 15&quot; is equivalent to an Earth–Sun distance of {{val|13750}} Earth radii.

[[Christiaan Huygens]] believed the distance was even greater: by comparing the apparent sizes of Venus and [[Mars]], he estimated a value of about {{val|24000}} Earth radii,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Goldstein|first=S. J., Jr.|title=Christiaan Huygens' Measurement of the Distance to the Sun|bibcode=1985Obs...105...32G|journal=Observatory|date=1985|volume=105|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; equivalent to a solar parallax of 8.6&quot;. Although Huygens' estimate is remarkably close to modern values, it is often discounted by historians of astronomy because of the many unproven (and incorrect) assumptions he had to make for his method to work; the accuracy of his value seems to be based more on luck than good measurement, with his various errors cancelling each other out.

[[File:Venustransit 2004-06-08 07-44.jpg|thumb|right|Transits of Venus across the face of the Sun were, for a long time, the best method of measuring the astronomical unit, despite the difficulties (here, the so-called &quot;[[black drop effect]]&quot;) and the rarity of observations.]]
[[Jean Richer]] and [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] measured the parallax of Mars between [[Paris]] and [[Cayenne]] in [[French Guiana]] when Mars was at its closest to Earth in 1672. They arrived at a figure for the solar parallax of {{frac|9|1|2}}&quot;, equivalent to an Earth–Sun distance of about {{val|22000}} Earth radii. They were also the first astronomers to have access to an accurate and reliable value for the radius of the Earth, which had been measured by their colleague [[Jean Picard]] in 1669 as {{val|3269}} thousand ''[[toise]]s''. Another colleague, [[Ole Rømer]], discovered the finite [[speed of light]] in 1676: the speed was so great that it was usually quoted as the time required for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth, or &quot;light time per unit distance&quot;, a convention that is still followed by astronomers today.

A better method for observing Venus transits was devised by [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]] and published in his ''[[Optica Promata]]'' (1663). It was strongly advocated by [[Edmond Halley]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Halley|first=E.|authorlink=Edmond Halley|date=1716|title=A new Method of determining the Parallax of the Sun, or his Distance from the Earth|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|volume=29|pages=454–64|url=http://www.dsellers.demon.co.uk/venus/ven_ch8.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was applied to the transits of Venus observed in 1761 and 1769, and then again in 1874 and 1882. Transits of Venus occur in pairs, but less than one pair every century, and observing the transits in 1761 and 1769 was an unprecedented international scientific operation. Despite the [[Seven Years' War]], dozens of astronomers were dispatched to observing points around the world at great expense and personal danger: several of them died in the endeavour.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Pogge|first=Richard|title=How Far to the Sun?

Another method involved determining the constant of [[aberration of light|aberration]], and [[Simon Newcomb]] gave great weight to this method when deriving his widely accepted value of 8.80″ for the solar parallax (close to the modern value of {{val|8.794143}}″), although Newcomb also used data from the transits of Venus. Newcomb also collaborated with [[Albert Abraham Michelson|A.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;Michelson]] to measure the speed of light with Earth-based equipment; combined with the constant of aberration (which is related to the light time per unit distance) this gave the first direct measurement of the Earth–Sun distance in kilometres. Newcomb's value for the solar parallax (and for the constant of aberration and the [[Gaussian gravitational constant]]) were incorporated into the first international system of [[astronomical constant]]s in 1896,&lt;ref&gt;Conférence internationale des étoiles fondamentales, Paris, 18–21 May 1896&lt;/ref&gt; which remained in place for the calculation of [[ephemeris|ephemerides]] until 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Resolution No. 4 of the [http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/IAU1964_French.pdf XIIth General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union], Hamburg, 1964&lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;astronomical unit&quot; appears first to have been used in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/astronomical%20unit astronomical unit] Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery of the [[near-Earth asteroid]] [[433 Eros]] and its passage near the Earth in 1900–1901 allowed a considerable improvement in parallax measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Hinks|first=Arthur R.|authorlink=Arthur Robert Hinks|title=Solar Parallax Papers No. 7: The General Solution from the Photographic Right Ascensions of Eros, at the Opposition of 1900|journal=Month.

R. Astron. Soc.|volume=66|date=1941|pages=11–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct radar measurements of the distances to Venus and Mars became available in the early 1960s. Along with improved measurements of the speed of light, these showed that Newcomb's values for the solar parallax and the constant of aberration were inconsistent with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Mikhailov|first=A. A.|date=1964|title=The Constant of Aberration and the Solar Parallax|bibcode=1964SvA.....7..737M|journal=Sov. Astron.|volume=7|issue=6|pages=737–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments==
[[Image:Stellarparallax parsec1.svg|thumb|right|The astronomical distance unit [[parsec]] uses the au as a baseline and an angle of one [[arcsecond]] for [[parallax]]. 1 au and 1 pc not to scale. (See also [[stellar parallax]])]]
The unit distance ''A'' (the value of the astronomical unit in metres) can be expressed in terms of other [[astronomical constant]]s:
:&lt;math&gt;A^3 = \frac{G M_\odot D^2}{k^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''G'' is the [[Newtonian gravitational constant]], {{Solar mass}} is the [[solar mass]], ''k'' is the numerical value of [[Gaussian gravitational constant]] and ''D'' is the time period of one day.
The Sun is constantly losing mass by radiating away energy,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Noerdlinger, Peter D.|arxiv=0801.3807|title=Solar Mass Loss, the Astronomical Unit, and the Scale of the Solar System|journal=[[Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy|Celest. Mech. Dynam. Astron.]]|bibcode = 2008arXiv0801.3807N|volume=0801|date=2008|pages=3807 }}&lt;/ref&gt; so the orbits of the planets are steadily expanding outward from the Sun. This has led to calls to abandon the astronomical unit as a unit of measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://space.newscientist.com/article/dn13286-astronomical-unit-may-need-to-be-redefined.html?feedId=online-news_rss20|title=AU may need to be redefined|newspaper=New Scientist|date=6 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[speed of light]] has an exact defined value in SI units and the Gaussian gravitational constant ''k'' is fixed in the [[astronomical system of units]], measuring the light time per unit distance is exactly equivalent to measuring the product ''G''{{Solar mass}} in SI units. Hence, it is possible to construct ephemerides entirely in SI units, which is increasingly becoming the norm.

A 2004 analysis of radiometric measurements in the inner Solar System suggested that the [[secular variation|secular increase]] in the unit distance was much larger than can be accounted for by solar radiation, +15±4&amp;nbsp;meters per century.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Krasinsky, G. A.; Brumberg, V. A.|title=Secular increase of astronomical unit from analysis of the major planet motions, and its interpretation|url=http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10569-004-0633-z|journal=Celest. Mech. Dynam. Astron.|volume=90|issue=3–4|date=2004|doi=10.1007/s10569-004-0633-z|pages=267–288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{Citation |title=Astrometric Solar-System Anomalies;§2: Increase in the astronomical unit |arxiv=0907.2469 |author=John D.

The measurements of the secular variations of the astronomical unit are not confirmed by other authors and are quite controversial. 
Furthermore, since 2010, the astronomical unit is not yet estimated by the planetary ephemerides.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |displayauthors=1 |first1=A. |last1=Fienga |last2=Kuchynka |first2=P. |last3=Manche |first3=H. |last4=Desvignes |first4=G. |last5=Gastineau |first5=M. |last6=Cognard |first6=I. |last7=Theureau |first7=G. |title=The INPOP10a planetary ephemeris and its applications in fundamental physics |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/k5456227385812m7/?MUD=MP |journal=Celest.
