{{Anthroposophy}}

'''Anthroposophy''', a philosophy founded by [[Rudolf Steiner]], postulates the existence of an objective, intellectually comprehensible [[spirituality|spiritual]] world accessible to direct experience through inner development. More specifically, it aims to develop faculties of perceptive imagination, inspiration and intuition through the cultivation of a form of thinking independent of sensory experience,&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;&gt;Robert McDermott, ''The Essential Steiner'', ISBN 0-06-065345-0, pp. 3&amp;ndash;11, 392&amp;ndash;5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.eb.com/eb/article-9007798 &quot;Anthroposophy&quot;], Encyclopædia Britannica online, accessed 10/09/07&lt;/ref&gt; and to present the results thus derived in a manner subject to rational verification. Anthroposophy aims to attain in its study of spiritual experience the precision and clarity attained by the [[natural science]]s in their investigations of the physical world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt; The philosophy has double roots in [[German idealism]] and [[German mysticism]]&lt;ref&gt;Christian Clement (ed.), ''Rudolf Steiner: Schriften über Mystik, Mysterienwesen und Religionsgeschichte''.  Frommann-holzboog Verlag, Stuttgart-Bad Cannstatt, 2013. ISBN 978-3-7728-2635-1. p. xlii&lt;/ref&gt; and was initially expressed in language drawn from [[Theosophy#Blavatskyan_Theosophy_and_the_Theosophical_Society|Theosophy]].

Anthroposophical ideas have been applied practically in many areas including [[Steiner/Waldorf education]], [[special education]] (most prominently through the [[Camphill Movement]]), [[biodynamic agriculture]], [[anthroposophical medicine|medicine]], [[ethical banking]], [[organizational development]], and the [[arts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibe.unesco.org/publications/ThinkersPdf/steinere.pdf Heiner Ullrich, &quot;Rudolf Steiner&quot;], ''Prospects: the quarterly review of comparative education'' (Paris, UNESCO: International Bureau of Education), vol.

==History==
[[File:Steiner um 1905.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rudolf Steiner]]]]

The early work of the founder of anthroposophy, [[Rudolf Steiner]], culminated in his ''[[Philosophy of Freedom]]'' (also translated as ''The Philosophy of Spiritual Activity'' and ''Intuitive Thinking as a Spiritual Path''). Here, Steiner developed a concept of [[free will]] based on inner experiences, especially those that occur in the creative activity of independent thought.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt;

By the beginning of the twentieth century, Steiner's interests turned to explicitly spiritual areas of research. His work began to interest others interested in spiritual ideas; among these was the [[Theosophical Society]]. From 1900 on, thanks to the positive reception given to his ideas, Steiner focused increasingly on [[Rudolf Steiner and the Theosophical Society|his work with the Theosophical Society]] becoming the [[General Secretary|secretary]] of its section in Germany in 1902. During the years of his leadership, membership increased dramatically, from a few individuals to sixty-nine Lodges.&lt;ref name=&quot;ahern2edAnthSec&quot;&gt;Of these, 55 Lodges – about 2,500 people – were to secede with Steiner to form his new Anthroposophical Society, at the end of 1912. Geoffrey Ahern, ''[http://www.sun-at-midnight.com/  Sun at Midnight: the Rudolf Steiner Movement and Gnosis in the West, 2nd edition]'', 2009, James Clark and Co, ISBN 978-0-227-17293-3, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1907, a split between Steiner and the mainstream Theosophical Society had begun to become apparent. While the Society was oriented toward an [[Orient|Eastern]] and especially [[India]]n approach, Steiner was trying to develop a path that embraced [[Christianity]] and [[natural science]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lachman&quot;&gt;Gary Lachman, ''Rudolf Steiner'', New York:Tarcher/Penguin ISBN 978-1-58542-543-3&lt;/ref&gt; The split became irrevocable when [[Annie Besant]], then president of the Theosophical Society, began to present the child [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] as the [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] Christ. Steiner strongly objected and considered any comparison between Krishnamurti and Christ to be nonsense; many years later, Krishnamurti also repudiated the assertion. Steiner's continuing differences with Besant led him to separate from the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]]; he was followed by the great majority of the membership of the Theosophical Society's German Section, as well as members of other national sections.&lt;ref name=&quot;ahern2edAnthSec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lachman&quot;/&gt;

By this time, Steiner had reached considerable stature as a spiritual teacher.&lt;ref&gt;Ahern, Geoffrey. (1984): Sun at Midnight: the Rudolf Steiner movement and the Western esoteric tradition&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke about what he considered to be his direct experience of the [[Akashic Records]] (sometimes called the &quot;Akasha Chronicle&quot;), thought to be a spiritual chronicle of the history, pre-history, and future of the world and mankind.  In a number of works,&lt;ref&gt;especially ''How to Know Higher Worlds'' and ''An Outline of Esoteric Science''&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner described a path of inner development he felt would let anyone attain comparable spiritual experiences. Sound vision could be developed, in part, by practicing rigorous forms of ethical and cognitive self-discipline, concentration, and meditation; in particular, a person's moral development must precede the development of spiritual faculties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Goetheanum Dornach.jpg|thumb|right|Second [[Goetheanum]], seat of the Anthroposophical Society]]
In 1912, the Anthroposophical Society was founded. After [[World War I]], the Anthroposophical movement took on new directions. Projects such as [[Waldorf education|schools]], [[Camphill Movement|centers for those with special needs]], organic farms and [[anthroposophical medicine|medical clinics]] were established, all inspired by anthroposophy.

In 1923, faced with differences between older members focusing on inner development and younger members eager to become active in the social transformations of the time, Steiner refounded the Society in an inclusive manner and established a School for Spiritual Science. As a spiritual basis for the refounded movement, Steiner wrote a &quot;[[wikisource:Foundation Stone Meditation|Foundation Stone Meditation]]&quot; which remains a central meditative expression of anthroposophical ideas.

Steiner died just over a year later, in 1925. The Second World War temporarily hindered the anthroposophical movement in most of Continental Europe, as the Anthroposophical Society and most of its daughter movements (e.g. Steiner/Waldorf education) were banned by the [[National Socialist]]s (Nazis);&lt;ref&gt;Inge Hansen-Schaberg and Bruno Schonig (eds.), ''Waldorf-Pädogogik'', ISBN 3-8340-0042-6&lt;/ref&gt; virtually no anthroposophists ever joined the National Socialist Party.&lt;ref&gt;Helmut Zander, ''Anthroposophie in Deutschland'', ISBN 978-3-525-55452-4. P. 250&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2007, national branches of the Anthroposophical Society had been established in fifty countries, and about 10,000 institutions around the world were working on the basis of anthroposophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goetheanum.org/121.html?&amp;L=1 |title=Goetheanum |publisher=Goetheanum |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the Anthroposophical Society was called the &quot;most important [[esoteric]] society in European history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Grote, [http://www.dradio.de/dkultur/sendungen/kulturinterview/655387/ &quot;Kosmische Wirkkräfte&quot;], German Radio interview 8 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
''Anthroposophy'' is an amalgam of the [[Greek language|Greek]] terms {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἄνθρωπος|ἄνθρωπος]]}} (''anthropos'' = &quot;human&quot;) and {{lang|grc|[[σοφία]]}} (''sophia'' = &quot;wisdom&quot;). It is listed by [[Nathan Bailey]] (1742) as meaning &quot;the knowledge of the nature of man&quot; ([[OED]]). Authors whose usage of the term predates Steiner's include occultist [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa|Agrippa von Nettesheim]], alchemist [[Thomas Vaughan (philosopher)|Thomas Vaughan]] (''Anthroposophia Theomagica''), and philosopher [[Robert von Zimmermann|Robert Zimmermann]].

Steiner began using the term in the early 1900s as an alternative to the term ''[[theosophy]]'' ([[Theosophy (history of philosophy)|divine wisdom]]), a term central to the [[Theosophical Society]], with which Steiner was associated at the time, and to a long tradition of European esotericists. Steiner probably first encountered the word &quot;anthroposophy&quot; in the work of Zimmermann, some of whose lectures in the University of Vienna he had attended while a student.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Zimmermann ''Geschichte der Aesthetik als philosophische Wissenschaft. Vienna, 1858.  Anthroposophie im Umriss-Entwurf eines Systems idealer Weltansicht auf realistischer Grundlage.'' (Vienna, 1882): Steiner, ''Anthroposophic Movement'': Lecture Two: ''The Unveiling of Spiritual Truths'',  11 June 1923.[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA258/English/RSP1993/19230611p01.html] the term was also used in a [http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/ilej/image1.pl?item=page&amp;seq=1&amp;size=1&amp;id=nq.1863.5.9.3.71.x.373 discussion of Boehme] in ''[[Notes and Queries]]'', May 9, 1863, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central ideas==

===Spiritual knowledge and freedom===
Anthroposophical proponents aim to extend the clarity of the [[scientific method]] to phenomena of human soul-life and to spiritual experiences. This requires developing new faculties of objective spiritual perception, which Steiner maintained was possible for humanity today. The steps of this process of inner development he identified as consciously achieved ''[[imagination]]'', ''[[:wikt:inspiration|inspiration]]'' and ''[[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;&gt;Peter Schneider, Einführung in die Waldorfpädogogik, ISBN 3-608-93006-X&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner believed results of this form of spiritual research should be expressed in a way that can be understood and evaluated on the same basis as the results of natural science:&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;/&gt; &quot;The anthroposophical schooling of thinking leads to the development of a non-sensory, or so-called supersensory consciousness, whereby the spiritual researcher brings the experiences of this realm into ideas, concepts, and expressive language in a form which people can understand who do not yet have the capacity to achieve the supersensory experiences necessary for individual research.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider20&quot;/&gt;

Steiner hoped to form a spiritual movement that would free the individual from any external authority: &quot;The most important problem of all human thinking is this: to comprehend the human being as a personality grounded in him or herself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider20&quot;&gt;Peter Schneider, ''Einführung in die Waldorfpädogogik'', pp. 20-1; Schneider quotes here from Steiner's dissertation, ''Truth and Knowledge''&lt;/ref&gt; For Steiner, the human capacity for [[rationality|rational]] thought would allow individuals to comprehend spiritual research on their own and bypass the danger of dependency on an authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider20&quot;/&gt;

Steiner contrasted the anthroposophical approach with both conventional [[mysticism]], which he considered lacking the clarity necessary for exact knowledge, and [[natural science]], which he considered arbitrarily limited to investigating the outer world.

===Nature of the human being===
[[File:Representative of humanity.gif|thumb|upright|''The Representative of Humanity'', detail of a sculpture in wood by Rudolf Steiner and Edith Maryon.]]
{{Main|Anthroposophical view of the human being}}
In ''Theosophy'', Steiner suggested that human beings unite a physical body of a nature common to (and that ultimately returns to) the inorganic world; a life body (also called the [[etheric body]]), in common with all living creatures (including plants); a bearer of [[sentience]] or [[consciousness]] (also called the [[astral body]]), in common with all [[animal]]s; and the ego, which anchors the faculty of self-awareness unique to human beings.

Anthroposophy describes a broad evolution of human consciousness. Early stages of human evolution possess an intuitive perception of reality, including a [[clairvoyance|clairvoyant]] perception of spiritual realities. Humanity has progressively evolved an increasing reliance on [[intellect]]ual faculties and a corresponding loss of intuitive or clairvoyant experiences, which have become atavistic. The increasing intellectualization of consciousness, initially a progressive direction of evolution, has led to an excessive reliance on [[abstraction]] and a loss of contact with both natural and spiritual realities. However, to go further requires new capacities that combine the clarity of intellectual thought with the imagination, and beyond this with consciously achieved inspiration and [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] insights.&lt;ref name=RAMcD&gt;Robert A. McDermott, &quot;Rudolf Steiner and Anthroposophy&quot;, in Faivre and Needleman, ''Modern Esoteric Spirituality'', ISBN 0-8245-1444-0, p. 299&amp;ndash;301; 288ff&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthroposophy speaks of the reincarnation of the human spirit: that the human being passes between stages of existence, incarnating into an earthly body, living on earth, leaving the body behind and entering into the spiritual worlds before returning to be born again into a new life on earth. After the [[death]] of the physical body, the human spirit recapitulates the past life, perceiving its events as they were experienced by the objects of its actions. A complex transformation takes place between the review of the past life and the preparation for the next life. The individual's [[karmic]] condition eventually leads to a choice of parents, physical body, disposition, and capacities that provide the challenges and opportunities that further development requires, which includes karmically chosen tasks for the future life.&lt;ref name=RAMcD/&gt;

Steiner described some conditions that determine the interdependence of a person's lives, or [[karma]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, Theosophy, ISBN 0-85440-269-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, An Outline of Esoteric Science, ISBN 0-88010-409-0&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evolution====
The anthroposophical view of [[evolution]] considers all [[animals]] to have evolved from an early, unspecialized form. As the least specialized animal, human beings have maintained the closest connection to the archetypal form;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Verhulst|first=Jos|title=Developmental Dynamics|year=2003|publisher=Adonis Press|location=Ghent, NY|isbn=978-0-932776-28-0|pages=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; contrary to the Darwinian conception of human evolution, all other animals ''devolve'' from this archetype.&lt;ref&gt;George Trevelyan ''Operation Redemption'' 1981, pp. 117-118&lt;/ref&gt; The spiritual archetype originally created by spiritual beings was devoid of physical substance; only later did this descend into material existence on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, ''Man as Symphony of the Creative Word'' and ''Occult Science''&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, human evolution has accompanied the Earth's evolution throughout the existence of the Earth.

{{quote|The evolution of man, Steiner said, has consisted in the gradual incarnation of a spiritual being into a material body. It has been a true &quot;descent&quot; of man from a spiritual world into a world of matter. The evolution of the animal kingdom did not precede, but rather ''accompanied'' the process of human incarnation. Man is thus not the end result of the evolution of the animals, but is rather in a certain sense their ''cause''. In the succession of types which appears in the fossil record-the fishes, reptiles, mammals, and finally fossil remains of man himself — the stages of this process of incarnation are reflected.|&lt;ref&gt;John Waterman ''Evolution and The Image of Man'' in A. C. Harwood ''The faithful thinker: Centenary essays on the work and thought of Rudolf Steiner'' Hodder and Stoughton, 1961, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Anthroposophy took over from Theosophy a complex system of cycles of world development and human evolution. The evolution of the world is said to have occurred in cycles. The first phase of the world consisted only of heat. In the second phase, a more active condition, light, and a more condensed, gaseous state separate out from the heat. In the third phase, a fluid state arose, as well as a sounding, forming energy. In the fourth (current) phase, solid physical matter first exists. This process is said to have been accompanied by an evolution of consciousness which led up to present human culture.

===Ethics===
The anthroposophical view is that good is found in the balance between two polar, generally [[evil]] influences on world and human evolution. Two spiritual adversaries endeavour to tempt and corrupt humanity: these are often described through their mythological embodiments, [[Lucifer]] and his counterpart [[Ahriman]], which have both positive and negative aspects. Lucifer is the light spirit, which &quot;plays on human pride and offers the delusion of divinity&quot;, but also motivates [[creativity]] and [[spirituality]]; Ahriman is the dark spirit, which tempts human beings to &quot;...deny [their] link with divinity and to live [[materialism|entirely on the material plane]]&quot;, but also stimulates intellectuality and [[technology]]. Both figures exert a negative effect on humanity when their influence becomes misplaced or one-sided, yet their influences are necessary for human freedom to unfold.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;/&gt;

Each human being has the task to find a balance between these opposing influences, and each is helped in this task by the mediation of the ''Representative of Humanity'', also known as the Christ being, a spiritual entity who stands between and harmonizes the two extremes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;/&gt;

==Applications==
{{Further2|[[Rudolf Steiner#Breadth of activity|Rudolf Steiner's Breadth of activities]]}}
Applications of anthroposophy include:

*[[Phenomenology (science)|Phenomenological approaches to science]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt;
*New approaches to [[painting]] and [[sculpture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt;
*John Wilkes' fountain-like [[flowform]]s. These sculptural forms guide water into rhythmic movement and are used both in water-purification projects and decoratively.

===Steiner/Waldorf education===
{{Main|Waldorf education}}
This is a pedagogical movement with over 1000 [[Waldorf education|Steiner or Waldorf schools]] (the latter name stems from the first such school, founded in Stuttgart in 1919) located in some 60 countries; the great majority of these are independent (private) schools.&lt;ref&gt;German Education Research Group, [http://www.waldorfschule.info/index.71.0.3.html &quot;International Associations and Waldorf Schools in alphabetical order of country&quot;]{{dead link|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen of the schools have been affiliated with the United Nations' [[UNESCO ASPNet|UNESCO Associated Schools Project Network]], which sponsors education projects that foster improved quality of education throughout the world, in particular in terms of its ethical, cultural, and international dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001223/122345E.pdf Agenda Fact Sheet, ''United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization'' dated 18 April 2001] The foundation, [[Friends of Waldorf Education]] (Freunde der Erziehungskunst), is one of the 26 non-governmental organizations worldwide to maintain official relations with UNESCO.

===Anthroposophical medicine===
{{Main|Anthroposophical medicine}}
Steiner gave several series of lectures to physicians and medical students. Out of those grew a [[complementary medicine|complementary medical]] movement intending to &quot;extend the knowledge gained through the methods of the natural sciences of the present age with insights from spiritual science.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, GA27, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt; This movement now includes hundreds of M.D.s, chiefly in Europe and North America, and has its own clinics, hospitals, and medical schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt;

Around the world today are a number of banks, companies, charities, and schools for developing co-operative forms of business using Steiner's ideas about economic associations, aiming at harmonious and socially responsible roles in the world economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt; The first anthroposophic bank was the ''[[GLS bank|Gemeinschaftsbank für Leihen und Schenken]]'' in [[Bochum]], [[Germany]], founded in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gls.de/ |title=Gemeinschaftsbank für Leihen und Schenken |publisher=Gls.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socially responsible investing|Socially responsible banks]] founded out of anthroposophy in the English-speaking world include [[Triodos Bank]], founded in 1980 and active in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Netherlands]], Germany, [[Belgium]], and [[Spain]], La Nef in France and [[RSF Social Finance]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/news_press_release,132566.shtml |title=Earth Times |publisher=Earth Times |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; in San Francisco.

===Organizational development, counselling and biography work===
[[Bernard Lievegoed]], a psychiatrist, founded a new method of individual and institutional development oriented towards humanizing organizations and linked with Steiner's ideas of the threefold social order. This work is represented by the [[NPI Institute for Organizational Development]] in the Netherlands and sister organizations in many other countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt; Various forms of [[Biography Work|biographic]] and counselling work have been developed on the basis of anthroposophy.

===Speech and drama===
There are also anthroposophical movements to renew speech and drama, the most important of which are based in the work of [[Marie Steiner-von Sivers]] (''speech formation'', also known as ''Creative Speech'') and the ''Chekhov Method'' originated by [[Michael Chekhov]] (nephew of [[Anton Chekhov]]).&lt;ref&gt;Byckling, L: [http://www.utoronto.ca/tsq/01/chekhovwest.shtml Michael Chekhov as Actor, Teacher and Director in the West].

==Social goals==
{{Main|Social Threefolding}}
For a period after World War I, Steiner was extremely active and well known in Germany, in part because he lectured widely proposing social reforms. Steiner was a sharp critic of [[nationalism]], which he saw as outdated, and a proponent of achieving social solidarity through individual freedom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt; A petition proposing a radical change in the German constitution and expressing his basic social ideas (signed by [[Herman Hesse]], among others) was widely circulated. His main book on social reform is ''Toward Social Renewal''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt;

Anthroposophy continues to aim at reforming society through maintaining and strengthening the independence of the spheres of [[culture|cultural life]], [[human rights]] and the [[economy]]. It emphasizes a particular ideal in each of these three realms of society:&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt;
# Freedom in cultural life
# [[Equality before the law|Equality]] of [[rights]], the sphere of [[legislation]] and the [[judiciary]]
# [[:wikt:fraternity|Fraternity]] in the [[economy|economic sphere]]

==Esoteric path==

===Paths of spiritual development===
According to Steiner, a real [[supernatural|spiritual]] world exists, out of which the material one gradually condensed and evolved. Steiner held that the spiritual world can be researched in the right circumstances through direct experience, by persons practicing rigorous forms of [[ethics|ethical]] and [[Cognition|cognitive]] [[self-discipline]]. Steiner described many exercises he said were suited to strengthening such self-discipline; the most complete exposition of these is found in his book ''How To Know Higher Worlds''. The aim of these exercises is to develop higher levels of [[higher consciousness|consciousness]] through [[meditation]] and [[observation]]. Details about the spiritual world, Steiner suggested, could on such a basis be discovered and reported, though no more infallibly than the results of natural science.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;/&gt;

{{quote|Anthroposophy is a path of knowledge, to guide the spiritual in the human being to the spiritual in the universe…. Anthroposophists are those who experience, as an essential need of life, certain questions on the nature of the human being and the universe, just as one experiences hunger and thirst.|&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, ''Anthroposophical Leading Thoughts'' (1924)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Steiner regarded his research reports as being important aids to others seeking to enter into spiritual experience. He suggested that a combination of spiritual exercises (for example, concentrating on an object such as a seed), moral development (control of thought, feelings and will combined with openness, tolerance and flexibility) and familiarity with other spiritual researchers' results would best further an individual's spiritual development. He consistently emphasised that any inner, spiritual practice should be undertaken in such a way as not to interfere with one's responsibilities in outer life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;/&gt; Steiner distinguished between what he considered were true and false paths of spiritual investigation.&lt;ref&gt;''True and False Paths in Spiritual Investigation'', first English edition 1927 (online [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/GA243/English/RSP1969/TruFal_index.html]), 2010 edition Kessinger Publishing Company ISBN 9781162592510&lt;/ref&gt;

In anthroposophy, artistic expression is also treated as a potentially valuable bridge between spiritual and material reality.&lt;ref&gt;Lindenberg, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prerequisites to and stages of inner development===
{{quote|A person seeking inner development must first of all make the attempt to give up certain formerly held inclinations. Then, new inclinations must be acquired by constantly holding the thought of such inclinations, virtues or characteristics in one's mind. They must be so incorporated into one's being that a person becomes enabled to alter his soul by his own will-power. This must be tried as objectively as a chemical might be tested in an experiment. A person who has never endeavored to change his soul, who has never made the initial decision to develop the qualities of endurance, steadfastness and calm logical thinking, or a person who has such decisions but has given up because he did not succeed in a week, a month, a year or a decade, will never conclude anything inwardly about these truths.|Rudolf Steiner|&quot;On the Inner Life&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsarchive.org/Lectures/InnDev_index.html |title=The Inner Development of Man |location=Fremont, Michigan |publisher=Rsarchive.org |date=1904-12-15 |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Steiner's stated prerequisites to beginning on a spiritual path include a willingness to take up serious cognitive studies, a respect for factual evidence, and a responsible attitude. Central to progress on the path itself is a harmonious cultivation of the following qualities:&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann_path&quot;&gt;[[Carlo Willmann]], ''Waldorfpädagogik'', ISBN 3-412-16700-2, pp. 10&amp;ndash;13&lt;/ref&gt;
* Control over one's own thinking
* Control over one's will
* Composure
* Positivity
* Impartiality

Steiner sees meditation as a concentration and enhancement of the power of thought. By focusing consciously on an idea, feeling or intention the meditant seeks to arrive at pure thinking, a state exemplified by but not confined to pure mathematics. In Steiner's view, conventional sensory-material knowledge is achieved through relating perception and concepts. The anthroposophic path of esoteric training articulates three further stages of supersensory knowledge, which do not necessarily follow strictly sequentially in any single individual's spiritual progress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann_path&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stein&gt;Stein, W. J., ''Die moderne naturwissenschaftliche Vorstellungsart und die Weltanschauung Goethes, wie sie Rudolf Steiner vertritt'', reprinted in Meyer, Thomas, ''W.J. Stein / Rudolf Steiner'', pp. 267&amp;ndash;75; 256&amp;ndash;7.&lt;/ref&gt;
* By focusing on symbolic patterns, images, and poetic mantras, the meditant can achieve consciously directed Imaginations that allow sensory phenomena to appear as the expression of underlying beings of a soul-spiritual nature.
* By transcending such imaginative pictures, the meditant can become conscious of the meditative activity itself, which leads to experiences of expressions of soul-spiritual beings unmediated by sensory phenomena or qualities.  Steiner calls this stage Inspiration.
* By intensifying the will-forces through exercises such as a chronologically reversed review of the day's events, the meditant can achieve a further stage of inner independence from sensory experience, leading to direct contact, and even union, with spiritual beings (&quot;Intuition&quot;) without loss of individual awareness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann_path&quot;/&gt;

===Spiritual exercises===
{{Main|Rudolf Steiner's exercises for spiritual development}}

Steiner described numerous exercises he believed would bring spiritual development; other anthroposophists have added many others. A central principle is that &quot;for every step in spiritual perception, three steps are to be taken in moral development.&quot; According to Steiner, moral development reveals the extent to which one has achieved control over one's inner life and can exercise it in harmony with the spiritual life of other people; it shows the real progress in spiritual development, the fruits of which are given in spiritual perception. It also guarantees the capacity to distinguish between false perceptions or illusions (which are possible in perceptions of both the outer world and the inner world) and true perceptions: i.e., the capacity to distinguish in any perception between the influence of subjective elements (i.e., viewpoint) and the objective reality the perception points at.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;/&gt;

==Place in Western philosophy==
Steiner built upon [[Goethe]]'s conception of an imaginative power capable of synthesizing the sense-perceptible form of a thing (an image of its outer appearance) and the concept we have of that thing (an image of its inner structure or nature). Steiner added to this the conception that a further step in the development of thinking is possible when the thinker observes his or her own thought processes. &quot;The organ of observation and the observed thought process are then identical, so that the condition thus arrived at is simultaneously one of perception through thinking and one of thought through perception.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;/&gt;

Thus, in Steiner's view, we can overcome the subject-object divide through inner activity, even though all human experience begins by being conditioned by it. In this connection, Steiner examines the step from thinking determined by outer impressions to what he calls sense-free thinking. He characterizes thoughts he considers without sensory content, such as mathematical or logical thoughts, as free deeds. Steiner believed he had thus located the origin of free will in our thinking, and in particular in sense-free thinking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;/&gt;

Some of the [[Epistemology|epistemic]] basis for Steiner's later anthroposophical work is contained in the seminal work, [[Philosophy of Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Pifer, &quot;Saul Bellow Against the Grain&quot;, University of Pennsylvania Press, 1990; see also Steiner's doctoral thesis, ''Truth and Science''&lt;/ref&gt; In his early works, Steiner sought to overcome what he perceived as the dualism of [[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]] idealism and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian subjectivism by developing Goethe's conception of the human being as a natural-supernatural entity, that is: natural in that humanity is a product of nature, supernatural in that through our conceptual powers we extend nature's realm, allowing it to achieve a reflective capacity in us as philosophy, art and science.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tarnas&quot;&gt;Richard Tarnas, ''The Passion of the Western Mind'', ISBN 0-7126-7332-6&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner was one of the first European philosophers to overcome the subject-object split in [[Western thought]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tarnas&quot;/&gt; Though not well known among philosophers, his philosophical work was taken up by [[Owen Barfield]] (and through him influenced the [[Inklings]], an [[Oxford]] group of Christian writers that included [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[C. S. Lewis]])&lt;ref&gt;Doris T. Myers, &quot;C.S. Lewis in Context.&quot;  Kent State University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Richard Tarnas]].

Christian and Jewish mystical thought have also influenced the development of anthroposophy.&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Jürgen Bader, Lorenzo Ravagli, ''Rudolf Steiner als aktiver Gegner des Antisemitismus'',  Bund der Freien Waldorfschulen, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paddock, F. and Spiegler, M., Judaism and Anthroposophy, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Union of science and spirit===
Steiner believed in the possibility of applying the clarity of scientific thinking to spiritual experience, which he saw as deriving from an objectively existing spiritual world.&lt;ref&gt;Christoph Lindenberg, ''Rudolf Steiner'', Rowohlt 1992, ISBN 3-499-50500-2, pp. 77ff&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner identified [[mathematics]], which attains certainty through thinking itself, thus through inner experience rather than empirical observation,&lt;ref&gt;Albert Einstein, [http://www.tu-harburg.de/rzt/rzt/it/Geometry.html Geometry and Experience]&lt;/ref&gt; as the basis of his epistemology of spiritual experience.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, ''Anthroposophy and Science'', lecture of March 16, 1921&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to religion==

===Christ as the center of earthly evolution===
Steiner's writing, though appreciative of all religions and cultural developments, emphasizes Western tradition as having evolved to meet contemporary needs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lachman&quot;/&gt; He describes Christ and his mission on earth of bringing individuated consciousness as having a particularly important place in human evolution,&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt; whereby:&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;/&gt;
*Christianity has evolved out of previous religions;
*The being which manifests in Christianity also manifests in all faiths and religions, and each religion is valid and true for the time and cultural context in which it was born;
*All historical forms of Christianity need to be transformed considerably to meet the continuing evolution of humanity.

{{quote|Spiritual science does not want to usurp the place of Christianity; on the contrary it would like to be instrumental in making Christianity understood. Thus it becomes clear to us through spiritual science that the being whom we call Christ is to be recognized as the center of life on earth, that the Christian religion is the ultimate religion for the earth's whole future. Spiritual science shows us particularly that the pre-Christian religions outgrow their one-sidedness and come together in the Christian faith. It is not the desire of spiritual science to set something else in the place of Christianity; rather it wants to contribute to a deeper, more heartfelt understanding of Christianity.|&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner,[http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/AntChr_index.html &quot;Anthroposophy and Christianity&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, anthroposophy considers there to be a being who unifies all religions, and who is not represented by any particular religious faith. This being is, according to Steiner, not only the Redeemer of [[the Fall of Man|the Fall from Paradise]], but also the unique pivot and meaning of earth's evolutionary processes and of human history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;/&gt; To describe this being, Steiner periodically used terms such as the &quot;Representative of Humanity&quot; or the &quot;good spirit&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Steiner|first=Rudolf|title=The foundations of human experience|year=1996|publisher=Anthroposophic Press|isbn=0-88010-392-2|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steiner|first=Rudolf|title=A Chapter of Occult History|url=http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/19081216p01.html|date=December 16, 1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than any denominational term.

This view has certain similarities to the concepts of Christogenesis advocated by [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]].

===Divergence from conventional Christian thought===
Steiner's views of Christianity diverge from conventional Christian thought in key places, and include [[gnostism|gnostic]] elements:

* One central point of divergence is Steiner's views on [[reincarnation]] and karma.
* Steiner differentiated three contemporary paths by which he believed it possible to arrive at [[Christ]]:
** Through heart-filled experiences of the [[Gospels]]; Steiner described this as the historically dominant path, but becoming less important in the future.
** Through inner experiences of a spiritual reality; this Steiner regarded as increasingly the path of spiritual or religious seekers today.
** Through [[initiation|initiatory experiences]] whereby the reality of Christ's death and resurrection are experienced; Steiner believed this is the path people will increasingly take.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;/&gt;
* Steiner also believed that there were two different [[Jesus]] children involved in the [[Incarnation]] of the Christ: one child descended from [[Solomon]], as described in the [[Gospel of Matthew]], the other child from [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]], as described in the [[Gospel of Luke]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt; (The genealogies given in the two gospels diverge some thirty generations before Jesus' birth, and 'Jesus' was a common name in biblical times.)
* His view of [[the second coming]] of Christ is also unusual; he suggested that this would not be a physical reappearance, but that the Christ being would become manifest in non-physical form, visible to spiritual vision and apparent in community life for increasing numbers of people beginning around the year 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Steiner, [http://wn.rsarchive.org/Lectures/ReapChrist/19100125p01.html &quot;The Appearance of Christ in the Etheric World&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* He emphasized his belief that in the future humanity would need to be able to recognize the ''Spirit of Love'' in all its genuine forms, regardless of what name would be used to describe this being. He also warned that the traditional name of the ''Christ'' might be misused, and the true essence of this being of love ignored.

===Judaism===
Rudolf Steiner wrote and lectured on Judaism and Jewish issues for much of his life. In the 1880s and 1890s, he took part in debates on anti-semitism and on assimilation. He was a fierce opponent of anti-semitism and supported the unconditional acceptance and integration of the Jews in Europe.&lt;ref name=Ralf&gt;Ralf Sonnenberg, [http://www.hagalil.com/antisemitismus/deutschland/steiner.htm “Judentum, Zionismus und Antisemitismus aus der Sicht Rudolf Steiners”]&lt;/ref&gt; He also supported [[Émile Zola]]'s position in the [[Dreyfus affair]].&lt;ref name=Ralf/&gt; In his later life, Steiner was accused by the [[Nazis]] of being a Jew, and [[Adolf Hitler]] called anthroposophy &quot;Jewish methods&quot;. The anthroposophical institutions in Germany were banned during Nazi rule and several anthroposophists sent to concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo Ravagli, ''Unter Hammer und Hakenkreuz: Der völkisch-nationalsozialistische Kampf gegen die Anthroposophie'', Verlag Freies Geistesleben, ISBN 3-7725-1915-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner emphasized Judaism's central importance to the constitution of the modern era in the West but suggested that to appreciate the spirituality of the future it would need to overcome its tendency toward abstraction. Important early anthroposophists who were Jewish included two central members on the executive boards of the precursors to the modern Anthroposophical Society, &lt;ref&gt;[http://biographien.kulturimpuls.org/detail.php?&amp;id=24 Adolf Arenson] (board member 1904-1913) and [http://biographien.kulturimpuls.org/detail.php?&amp;id=724 Carl Unger] (board member 1908-1923)&lt;/ref&gt; and Karl König, the founder of the [[Camphill movement]]. [[Martin Buber]] and [[Hugo Bergmann]], who viewed Steiner's social ideas as a solution to the [[Arab–Israeli conflict|Arab–Jewish conflict]], were also influenced by anthroposophy.&lt;ref&gt;Paddock &amp; Spiegler 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several anthroposophical organisations in [[Israel]], including the anthroposophical [[kibbutz]] [[Harduf]], founded by [[Jesaiah Ben-Aharon]]. A number of these organizations are striving to foster positive relationships between the Arab and Jewish populations: The Harduf Waldorf school includes both Jewish and Arab faculty and students, and has extensive contact with the surrounding Arab communities. In Hilf near Haifa, there is a joint Arab-Jewish Waldorf kindergarten, the first joint Arab-Jewish kindergarten in Israel.

===Christian Community===
{{Main|Christian Community}}
Towards the end of Steiner's life, a group of theology students (primarily Lutheran, with some Roman Catholic members) approached Steiner for help in reviving Christianity, in particular &quot;to bridge the widening gulf between modern science and the world of spirit.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt; They approached a notable [[Lutheran]] pastor, [[Friedrich Rittelmeyer]], who was already working with Steiner's ideas, to join their efforts. Out of their co-operative endeavor, the ''Movement for Religious Renewal'', now generally known as [[The Christian Community]], was born. Steiner emphasized that he considered this movement, and his role in creating it, to be independent of his anthroposophical work,&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential&quot;/&gt; as he wished anthroposophy to be independent of any particular [[religion]] or religious denomination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;/&gt;

===Scientific basis===
Though Rudolf Steiner studied [[natural science]] at the Vienna Technical University at the undergraduate level, his [[doctorate]] was in epistemology and very little of his work is directly concerned with the empirical sciences. In his mature work, when he did refer to science it was often to present phenomenological or [[Goethean science]] as an alternative to what he considered the materialistic science of his contemporaries.&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt;

His primary interest was in applying the methodology of science to realms of inner experience and the spiritual worlds (Steiner's appreciation that the essence of science is its method of inquiry is unusual among [[esoteric]]ists&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt;), and Steiner called anthroposophy ''[[Geisteswissenschaft]]'' (lit.: Science of the mind, or cultural or spiritual science), a term generally used in German to refer to the [[humanities]] and [[social science]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philolex.de/geistwis.htm |title=Philolex entry |publisher=Philolex.de |date= |accessdate=2013-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; in fact, the term &quot;[[science]]&quot; is used more broadly in [[Europe]] as a general term that refers to any exact knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Barzun, ''Science: The Glorious Entertainment'', Harper and Row 1964. P. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[Anthroposophy's] methodology is to employ a scientific way of thinking, but to apply this methodology, which normally excludes our inner experience from consideration, instead to the human being proper.|&lt;ref name=Stein/&gt;}}

Whether this is a sufficient basis for anthroposophy to be considered a spiritual science has been a matter of controversy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;&gt;Carlo Willmann, ''Waldorfpädagogik: Theologische und religionspädagogische Befunde'', ISBN 3-412-16700-2, Chap. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hammer&gt;Olav Hammer, ''Claiming Knowledge: Strategies of Epistemology from Theosophy to the New Age'', Brill 2004, pp. 243, 329, 204, 225&amp;ndash;8&lt;/ref&gt; As Freda Easton explained in her study of Waldorf schools, &quot;Whether one accepts anthroposophy as a science depends upon whether one accepts Steiner's interpretation of a science that extends the consciousness and capacity of human beings to experience their inner spiritual world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Freda Easton, ''The Waldorf Impulse in Education'', Columbia University dissertation 1995&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sven Ove Hansson]] has disputed anthroposophy's claim to a scientific basis, stating that its ideas are not empirically derived and neither reproducible nor testable.&lt;ref&gt;Sven Ove Hansson, ''Is Anthroposophy Science?'', Professor, Philosophy Unit of the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology, in Conceptus XXV (1991), No. 64, pp. 37&amp;ndash;49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlo Willmann points out that as, on its own terms, anthroposophical methodology offers no possibility of being falsified except through its own procedures of spiritual investigation, no [[intersubjectivity|intersubjective validation]] is possible by conventional scientific methods; it thus cannot stand up to [[positivism|positivistic science]]'s criticism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willmann&quot;/&gt; Peter Schneider calls such objections untenable on the grounds that if a non-sensory, non-physical realm exists, then according to Steiner the experiences of pure thinking possible within the normal realm of consciousness would already be experiences of that, and it would be impossible to exclude the possibility of empirically grounded experiences of other supersensory content.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;/&gt;

Olav Hammer suggests that anthroposophy carries [[scientism]] &quot;to lengths unparalleled in any other Esoteric position&quot; due to its dependence upon claims of clairvoyant experience, its subsuming natural science under &quot;spiritual science&quot;, and its development of what Hammer calls &quot;fringe&quot; sciences such as [[anthroposophical medicine]] and [[biodynamic agriculture]] justified partly on the basis of the ethical and ecological values they promote, rather than purely on a scientific basis.&lt;ref name=Hammer/&gt;

Though Steiner saw that spiritual vision itself is difficult for others to achieve, he recommended open-mindedly exploring and rationally testing the results of such research; he also urged others to follow a spiritual training that would allow them directly to apply the methods he used eventually to achieve comparable results.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schneider&quot;/&gt; Some results of Steiner's research have been investigated and supported by scientists working to further and extend scientific observation in directions suggested by an anthroposophical approach.&lt;ref&gt;''Genetics and the Manipulation of Life, The Forgotten Factor of Context'', by biologist Craig Holdrege; ''The Wholeness of Nature, Goethe's Way toward A Science of Conscious Participation in Nature'', by physicist Henri Bortoft; ''Developmental Dynamics in Humans and Other Primates'', by theoretical chemist Jos Verhulst.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious nature===
As an explicitly spiritual movement, anthroposophy has sometimes been called a religious philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=anthroposophy definition - Dictionary - MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561500913/anthroposophy.html|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kyWUo6lQ|archivedate=2009-11-01|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, a California federal court ruled that a group alleging that anthroposophy is a religion for [[Establishment Clause]] purposes did not provide any legally admissible evidence in support of this view; the case is under appeal. In 2000, a French court ruled that a government minister's description of anthroposophy as a cult was defamatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Anthroposophical ideas have been criticized from both sides in the race debate:
*From the mid-1930s on, National Socialist ideologues attacked the anthroposophical world-view as being opposed to Nazi racist and nationalistic principles; anthroposophy considered &quot;Blood, Race and Folk&quot; as primitive instincts that must be overcome.&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Wilhelm Hauer, 7. Februar 1935. BAD R 4901&amp;ndash;3285.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Report of the SD-Hauptamtes Berlin: &quot;Anthroposophy”, May 1936, BAD Z/B I 904.&lt;/ref&gt;

*&quot;A naive version of the evolution of consciousness, a theory foundational to both Steiner's anthroposophy and Waldorf education, sometimes places one race below another in one or another dimension of development&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McDermott&quot;&gt;Ray McDermott et al.: [http://www.springerlink.com/content/5q9t836w350v8768/ ''Waldorf education in an inner-city public school''.] ''The Urban Review'', Volume 28, Number 2 / June, 1996, pp. 119&amp;ndash;140&lt;/ref&gt;

The Anthroposophical Society in America has stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We explicitly reject any racial theory that may be construed to be part of Rudolf Steiner's writings. The Anthroposophical Society in America is an open, public society and it rejects any purported spiritual or scientific theory on the basis of which the alleged superiority of one race is justified at the expense of another race.&lt;ref&gt;The General Council of the Anthroposophical Society in America (1998) [http://web.archive.org/web/20080106140711/http://www.anthroposophy.org/Gov/StatementOnDiversity.php Position Statement on Diversity].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
