The '''Black Russian''' is a [[cocktail]] of [[vodka]] and [[coffee liqueur]]. It contains five parts vodka to two parts coffee liqueur, per [[IBA Official Cocktail|IBA]] specified ingredients. Traditionally the drink is made by pouring the vodka over [[ice cube]]s or cracked ice in an [[old-fashioned glass]], followed by the coffee liqueur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = SpiritDrinks.com - Black Russian | publisher = SpiritDrinks | url = http://www.spiritdrinks.com/cocktails/Black_Russian.asp | accessdate = July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This combination first appeared in 1949, and is ascribed to Gustave Tops, a [[Demographics of Belgium|Belgian]] [[Bartender|barman]], who created it at the [[Hotel Metropole, Brussels|Hotel Metropole]] in [[Brussels]] in honor of [[Perle Mesta]], then [[United States|U.S.]] [[ambassador]] to [[Luxembourg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sicard&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | last = Sicard | first = Cheri | title = Featured Cocktails - Black Russian and White Russian | publisher = FabulousFoods.com | date = August 6, 2007 | url = http://www.fabulousfoods.com/index.php?option=com_resource&amp;controller=article&amp;article=21219&amp;category_id=237&amp;Itemid=177 | accessdate = June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cocktail owes its name to the use of vodka, a typical Russian spirit, and the blackness of the coffee liqueur.
