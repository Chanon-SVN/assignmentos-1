The '''Branch Davidians''' (also known as &quot;The Branch&quot;) are a religious group that originated in 1955 from a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] in the [[Davidian Seventh-day Adventist]]s (&quot;Davidians&quot;), a reform movement that began as an offshoot from the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] (&quot;Adventists&quot;) around 1930. The majority of those who accepted the reform message had been removed from membership of the Seventh-day Adventist Church because of aberrant teachings.

From its inception in 1930, the reform movement believed themselves to be living in a time when [[Bible]] prophecies of a final divine judgment were coming to pass as a prelude to Christ's [[second coming]]. The name &quot;Branch Davidian&quot; is most widely known for the [[Waco siege]] of 1993 on their property (known as the [[Mount Carmel Center]]) near [[Waco, Texas]].  The 51-day siege, by the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]], [[FBI]], and [[Texas National Guard]], resulted in the deaths of the Branch Davidians' leader, [[David Koresh]], as well as 82 other Branch Davidian men, women, and children, and four ATF agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120472/ |title= Waco: The Rules of Engagement (1997) |author1= Gazecki, William |author2= Gifford, Dan |author3= McNulty, Michael |work= Film Documentary |publisher= IMDb - Internet Movie Database |accessdate= 25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= The Branch Davidians of Waco: The History and Beliefs of an Apocalyptic Sect |author1= Newport, Kenneth G.C. |date= June 22, 2006 |publisher= Oxford University Press  |ISBN= 978-0199245741 |accessdate= 25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history ==
In 1929 [[Victor Houteff]], a [[Bulgaria]]n [[immigrant]] and a Seventh-day Adventist Sabbath School teacher in a local church in Southern California, claimed that he had a new message for the entire church. He presented this message in a book, ''[[Shepherd's Rod|The Shepherd's Rod: The 144,000—A Call for Reformation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists |url=http://www.the-branch.org/Shepherds_Rod_Volume_1_Houteff |title=The Shepherd's Rod, Vol. 1 |publisher=The-branch.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Adventist leadership rejected Houteff's message as contrary to the Adventists' basic teachings and disfellowshipped (removed from membership) Houteff and his followers. However, there was some controversy over the method the leadership took to disfellowship Houteff.

In 1935 Houteff established his headquarters to the west of Waco, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ird01 |title= Davidians and Branch Davidians |author1= Pitts, William L |publisher= Handbook of Texas - Texas State Historical Association |accessdate= November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Houteff died in 1955, the segment of the group loyal to Houteff continued as the [[Davidian Seventh-day Adventist]]s. 

But a splinter group, the Branch Davidian Seventh-day Adventists, was begun by [[Benjamin Roden]] and headed after Roden's death by his wife [[Lois Roden]]. After Lois Roden died a bitter power struggle ensued between Lois Roden's son [[George Roden]] and her designated successor [[David Koresh]] (then still using his birth name of Vernon Howell), eventually won by Koresh.

==Waco Siege==
{{main|Waco siege}}

By the time of the [[Waco Siege]], Koresh had encouraged his followers to think of themselves as &quot;students of the Seven Seals&quot; rather than as &quot;Branch Davidians.&quot; During the standoff one of his followers publicly announced that he wanted them to thereafter be identified by the name &quot;Koreshians&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mr. Ricks [FBI negotiator] said today that Ms. Schroeder had told him that members of the sect, a renegade offshoot of Seventh-day Adventists, henceforth wanted to be known as Koreshians.&quot; By Robert Reinhold, Published: March 15, 1993 ''New York Times'' [brackets added].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Since the Waco Siege==
It is claimed that Koresh was never authorised to use the name ‘Branch Davidians’ for his breakaway sect,&lt;ref&gt;The General Association of Branch Davidian Seventh Day Adventists,&lt;/ref&gt; and that the church of that name continues to represent that part of the Branch church which did not follow him.
