'''Agriculture''' is the cultivation of [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[Fungus|fungi]], and other life forms for [[food]], [[fiber]], [[biofuel]], [[medicinal]]s and other products used to sustain and enhance human life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Office1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= |title=Safety and health in agriculture |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GtBa6XIW_aQC&amp;pg=PA77 |year=1999 |publisher=International Labour Organization |isbn=978-92-2-111517-5 |pages=77– |accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture was the key development in the rise of [[sedentism|sedentary]] [[human civilization]], whereby farming of [[domestication|domesticated]] species created food [[economic surplus|surpluses]] that nurtured the development of [[civilization]]. The study of agriculture is known as [[agricultural science]]. The [[history of agriculture]] dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different [[climate]]s, [[Culture|cultures]], and technologies. However, all farming generally relies on techniques to expand and maintain the lands that are suitable for raising domesticated species. For plants, this usually requires some form of [[irrigation]], although there are methods of [[dryland farming]]. [[Livestock]] are raised in a combination of grassland-based and landless systems, in an industry that covers almost one-third of the world's ice- and water-free area. In the developed world, [[industrial agriculture]] based on large-scale [[monoculture]] has become the dominant system of modern farming, although there is growing support for [[sustainable agriculture]], including [[permaculture]] and [[organic farming|organic agriculture]].

Until the [[Industrial Revolution]], the vast majority of the human population labored in agriculture. Pre-industrial agriculture was typically [[subsistence agriculture]]/[[self-sufficiency]] in which farmers raised most of their crops for their own consumption instead of [[cash crop]]s for trade. A remarkable shift in agricultural practices has occurred over the past century in response to new technologies, and the development of world markets. This also has led to technological improvements in agricultural techniques, such as the [[Haber-Bosch]] method for synthesizing [[ammonium nitrate]] which made the traditional practice of recycling [[nutrient]]s with [[crop rotation]] and animal [[manure]] less important.

Modern [[agronomy]], [[plant breeding]], [[agrochemical]]s such as [[pesticide]]s and [[fertilizers]], and technological improvements have sharply increased yields from cultivation, but at the same time have caused widespread ecological damage and negative human health effects. [[Selective breeding]] and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about [[animal welfare]] and the health effects of the [[antibiotics]], [[growth hormones]], and other chemicals commonly used in industrial meat production. [[Genetically modified organisms]] are an increasing component of agriculture, although they are banned in several countries. Agricultural food production and water management are increasingly becoming global issues that are fostering debate on a number of fronts. Significant degradation of land and water resources, including the depletion of [[aquifer]]s, has been observed in recent decades, and the effects of global warming on agriculture and of agriculture on global warming are still not fully understood.

The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, [[fuel]]s, and [[raw material]]s. Specific foods include [[cereal]]s (grains), [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[cooking oil|oils]], [[meat]]s and [[spice]]s. Fibers include [[cotton]], [[wool]], [[hemp]], [[silk]] and [[flax]]. Raw materials include [[lumber]] and [[bamboo]]. Other useful materials are produced by plants, such as [[resin]]s, [[natural dye|dyes]], [[drug]]s, [[perfume]]s, [[biofuel]]s and ornamental products such as [[Floriculture|cut flowers]] and [[nursery (horticulture)|nursery plants]]. Over one third of the world's workers are employed in agriculture, second only to the services' sector, although the percentages of agricultural workers in developed countries has decreased significantly over the past several centuries.

==Etymology and terminology==
The word ''agriculture'' is a late [[Middle English]] adaptation of Latin ''agricultūra'', from ''ager'', &quot;field&quot;, and ''cultūra'', &quot;[[Tillage|cultivation]]&quot; or &quot;growing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=14|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Word Histories|editor=Chantrell, Glynnis|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=0-19-863121-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture usually refers to human activities, although it is also observed in certain species of [[ant]], [[termite]] and [[ambrosia beetle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.102003.152626|title=The Evolution of Agriculture in Insects|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|volume=36|pages=563–595|date=December 2005|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.102003.152626|author=Ulrich G. Mueller, Nicole M. Gerardo, Duur K. Aanen, Diana L. Six, and Ted R. Schultz}}&lt;/ref&gt; To practice agriculture means to use natural resources to &quot;produce commodities which maintain life, including food, fiber, forest products, horticultural crops, and their related services.&quot;&lt;ref name=Maine/&gt; This definition includes [[arable farming]] or [[agronomy]], and [[horticulture]], all terms for the growing of plants, [[animal husbandry]] and [[forestry]].&lt;ref name=Maine&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/education/aged/definition.html|title=Definition of Agriculture|publisher=State of Maine|accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction is sometimes made between forestry and agriculture, based on the former's longer management rotations, extensive versus intensive management practices and development mainly by nature, rather than by man. Even then, it is acknowledged that there is a large amount of knowledge transfer and overlap between [[silviculture]] (the management of forests) and agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=15–16|url=http://books.google.com/?id=VMw9VcLT-FYC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=differences+between+forestry+and+agriculture#v=onepage&amp;q=differences%20between%20forestry%20and%20agriculture&amp;f=false|title=Forestry Research: A Mandate for Change|author=Committee on Forestry Research, National Research Council|publisher=National Academies Press|year=1990|isbn=0-309-04248-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional farming, the two are often combined even on small landholdings, leading to the term [[agroforestry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80364e/80364E04.htm#Agro-forestry%20and%20forest%20laws,%20policies,%20and%20customs|chapter=Applicability of agro-forestry systems|author=Budowski, Gerardo|publisher=United Nations University|title=Agro-forestry in the African Humid Tropics|editor=MacDonald, L.H.|year=1982|isbn=92-808-0364-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agricultural practices such as [[irrigation]], [[crop rotation]], application of [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s, and the [[domestication]] of livestock were developed long ago, but have made great progress in the past century. The [[history of agriculture]] has played a major role in [[history of the world|human history]], as agricultural progress has been a crucial factor in worldwide [[social change|socio-economic change]]. [[Division of labour]] in agricultural societies made commonplace specializations rarely seen in [[hunter-gatherer]] cultures, which allowed the growth of towns and cities, and the complex societies we call [[civilization]]s. When farmers became capable of producing food beyond the needs of their own families, others in their society were free to devote themselves to projects other than food acquisition. Historians and anthropologists have long argued that the development of agriculture made civilization possible. According to geographer [[Jared Diamond]], the costs of agriculture were: &quot;the average daily number of work hours increased, nutrition deteriorated, infectious disease and body wear increased, and lifespan shortened.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The World Until Yesterday|author=Jared Diamond|page=353|isbn=978-0-670-02481-0|publisher=Viking|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prehistoric origins===
[[Forest gardening]], a plant-based food production system, is thought to be the world's oldest [[agroecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Forest Farms of Kandy: And Other Gardens of Complete Design|author=Douglas John McConnell|year=2003|page=1|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QYBSfUJPQXcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=the%20forest%20farms%20of%20kandy%20and%20other%20gardens%20of%20complete%20design&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-7546-0958-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forest gardens originated in [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] times along jungle-clad river banks and in the wet foothills of [[monsoon]] regions. In the gradual process of a family improving their immediate environment, useful tree and vine species were identified, protected and improved whilst undesirable species were eliminated. Eventually superior foreign species were selected and incorporated into the family's garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The forest-garden farms of Kandy, Sri Lanka|author=Douglas John McConnell|year=1992|page=1|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G3QPo7lThXsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20forest-garden%20farms%20of%20Kandy%2C%20Sri%20Lanka.&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-92-5-102898-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neolithic===
{{Further|Neolithic Revolution}}
[[File:Trilla del trigo en el Antiguo Egipto.jpg|thumb|Threshing of grain in ancient Egypt]]
The [[Fertile Crescent]] of [[Western Asia]] first saw the domestication of animals, starting the Neolithic Revolution. Between 10,000 and 13,000 years ago, the ancestors of modern cattle, sheep, goats and pigs were domesticated in this area. The gradual transition from wild harvesting to deliberate cultivation happened independently in several areas around the globe.&lt;ref name=NatGeo/&gt; Agriculture allowed for the support of an increased population, leading to larger societies and eventually the development of cities. It also created the need for greater organization of political power (and the creation of [[social stratification]]), as decisions had to be made regarding labor and harvest allocation and access rights to water and land. Agriculture bred immobility, as populations settled down for long periods of time, which led to the accumulation of material goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anthro.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/arch/neolithic/Neo3-LivRev.html|title= Living the Revolution|author=DK Jordan|date=24 November 2012|work=The Neolithic|publisher=University of California – San Diego|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early [[Neolithic]] villages show evidence of the ability to process grain, and the Near East is the ancient home of the ancestors of [[wheat]], [[barley]] and [[pea]]s. There is evidence of the cultivation of [[Common fig|figs]] in the [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]] as long as 11,300 years ago, and [[cereal]] (grain) production in Syria approximately 9,000 years ago. During the same period, farmers in China began to farm [[rice]] and [[millet]], using man-made floods and fires as part of their cultivation regimen.&lt;ref name=NatGeo&gt;{{cite web|url=https://genographic.nationalgeographic.com/development-of-agriculture/|title=The Development of Agriculture|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiber crops were domesticated as early as food crops, with China domesticating [[hemp]], [[cotton]] being developed independently in Africa and South America, and the Near East domesticating [[flax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Plant evolution and the origin of crop species|page=119|author=Hancock, James F.|url=http://books.google.com/?id=j_O9ZnFRNngC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=domestication+of+fiber+crops#v=onepage&amp;q=domestication%20of%20fiber%20crops&amp;f=false|publisher=CABI|year=2012|isbn=1-84593-801-1|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of soil amendments, including manure, fish, compost and ashes, appears to have begun early, and developed independently in several areas of the world, including [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Nile Valley]] and Eastern Asia.&lt;ref name=FertMan&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=qPkoOU4BvEsC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;dq=history+of+fertilizer#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20fertilizer&amp;f=false|page=46|author=UN Industrial Development Organization, [[International Fertilizer Development Center]]|title=The Fertilizer Manual|publisher=Springer|year=1998|edition=3rd|isbn=0-7923-5032-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harvester.jpg|thumb|Roman harvesting machine|left]]
[[Squash (plant)|Squash]] was grown in Mexico nearly 10,000 years ago, while [[maize]]-like plants, derived from the wild [[teosinte]], began to be seen at around 9,000 years ago. The derivation of teosinte into modern corn was slow, however, and it took until 5,500&lt;ref name=NatGeo/&gt; to 6,000 years ago to turn into what we know today as maize. It then gradually spread across North America and was the major crop of Native Americans at the time of European exploration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=S. Johannessen and C. A.

Combined with [[Bell pepper|peppers]], these crops provided a balanced diet for much of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anthro.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/arch/neolithic/Neo2-Beyond.html|title= Beyond Wheat|author=DK Jordan|date=24 November 2012|work=The Neolithic|publisher=University of California – San Diego|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grape]]s were first grown for [[wine]] approximately 8,000 years ago, in the [[Southern Caucasus]], and by 3000 BC had spread to the Fertile Crescent, the Jordan Valley and Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2011/01/domestics-grape-genome-sequenced/1#.UYWuIcrEl-A|title=Grapes domesticated 8,000 years ago|author=Vergano, Dan|date=19 January 2011|accessdate=4 May 2013|journal=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agriculture advanced to Europe slightly later, reaching the northeast of the continent from the east around 4000 BC. The idea that agriculture spread to Europe, rather than independently developing there, has led to two main hypotheses. The first is a &quot;wave of advance&quot;, which holds that agriculture traveled slowly and steadily across the continent, while the second, &quot;population pulse&quot; theory, holds that it moved in jumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anthro.ucsd.edu/~dkjordan/arch/neolithic/Neo1-AgRev.html|title= The &quot;Agricultural Revolution&quot;|author=DK Jordan|date=24 November 2012|work=The Neolithic|publisher=University of California – San Diego|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also around 6000 years ago, horses first began to be domesticated in the Eurasian [[steppe]]s. Initially used for food, it was quickly discovered that they were useful for field work and carrying goods and people.&lt;ref name=Horse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nal.usda.gov/awic/pubs/HorseHistory/intro.shtml|title=Horses in History: A Bibliography|publisher=USDA National Agricultural Library|accessdate=24 May 2013|author=Adams, Kristina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 5,000 years ago, [[sunflower]]s were first cultivated in North America, while South America's [[Andes|Andes region]] was developing the [[potato]].&lt;ref name=NatGeo/&gt; A minor center of domestication, the indigenous peoples of the eastern United States appear to have domesticated numerous crops, including [[tobacco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Heiser, Carl B., Jr.|year=1992|title= On Possible Sources of the Tobacco of Prehistoric Eastern North America|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=33|pages=54–56|doi=10.1086/204032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bronze and Iron Ages===
Beginning around 3000 BC, nomadic [[pastoralism]], with societies focused on the care of livestock for subsistence, appeared independently in several areas in Europe and Asia. The main region was the [[steppe]]s stretching from the [[Hungarian Plain]] to [[Manchuria]], where cattle, sheep, horses, and to a lesser extent [[yak]]s and [[bactrian camel]]s provided sustenance. The second was in [[Arabia]], where [[dromedary|one-humped camels]] were the main animal, with sheep, goats and horses also seen. The third area was a band of societies in areas of eastern and central Africa with a [[tropical savannah]] climate. Cattle and goats were found most often in this area, with smaller numbers of sheep, horses and camels. A fourth area, more minor than the others, was found in northern Europe and Asia and was focused on [[reindeer]] herding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Richerson/BooksOnline/101text.htm Principles of Human Ecology]|pages=79–80|url=http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Richerson/BooksOnline/He5-95.pdf|title=Chapter 5: Pastoral Societies|author=Richerson, Peter J.|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2500 and 2000 BC, the simplest form of the [[plough]], called the [[ard (plough)|ard]], spread throughout Europe, replacing the [[hoe (tool)|hoe]]. This change in equipment significantly increased cultivation ability, and affected the demand for land, as well as ideas about property, inheritance and family rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=cHRvtwTLcMAC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=ard+plough+3500+BC#v=onepage&amp;q=ard%20plough%203500%20BC&amp;f=false|page=28|title=Cambridge Economic History of Europe: Vol. 2: Trade and Industry in the Middle Ages|editor=Michael Moïssey Postan, H. J. Habakkuk, Miller, Edward|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1987|isbn=0-521-08709-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this period, simple [[digging stick]]s or hoes were used. These tools would have also been easier to transport, which was a benefit as people only stayed until the soil's nutrients were depleted. However, as the continuous cultivating of smaller pieces of land became a sustaining practice throughout the world, ards were much more efficient than digging sticks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Seventy Great Inventions of the Ancient World|author=Brian M. Fagan|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|year=2004|isbn=0-500-05130-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As humanity became more stationary, empires, such as the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] and the [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]], arose, dependent upon agriculture to feed their growing populations, and slavery, which was used to provide the labor needed for continually intensifying agricultural processes. Agricultural technology continued to improve, allowing the expansion of available crop varieties, including a wide range of fruits, vegetables, oil crops, spices and other products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/empires/egypt/newkingdom/farming.html|title=Farming|work=Egypt's Golden Empire|publisher=PBS|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/hort_306/text/lec18.pdf|title=Roman Agricultural History|author=Janick, Jules|year=2008|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; China was also an important center for agricultural technology development during this period. During the [[Zhou dynasty]] (1666–221 BC), the first canals were built, and irrigation was used extensively. The later [[Three Kingdoms]] and [[Northern dynasty|Northern]] and [[Southern dynasty|Southern dynasties]] (221–581 AD) brought the first biological pest control, extensive writings on agricultural topics and technological innovations such as [[steel]] and the [[wheelbarrow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/hort_306/text/lec12.pdf|format=PDF|title=History of Agricultural and Horticultural Technology in Asia|author=Janick, Jules|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=23 May 2013|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient world, fresh products, such as meats, dairy products and fresh fruits and vegetables, were likely consumed relatively close to where they were produced. Less perishable products, such as grains, preserved foods, olive oil and wine, were often traded over an extensive network of land and sea routes. The ancient trade in agricultural goods was well established, with wine traded in the Mediterranean region in the 6th century BC and Rome receiving extensive shipments of grain as tax payments by the 2nd century BC. Huge amounts of grain were transported, mainly by sea, and it was during this period that the subsidization of grain farming began, for the prevention of famine. Ancient Rome was a major center for agricultural trade. Trade routes stretched from Britain and Scandinavia in the west to India and China in the east, and included major crops, such as grain, wine and olive oil (also a fuel for [[oil lamp]]s), as well as additional products, including spices, fabrics and drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=194–196|title=Handbook to Life in Ancient Rome|url=http://books.google.com/?id=9JJdqJ8YGH8C&amp;pg=PA195&amp;lpg=PA195&amp;dq=ancient+grain+trade#v=onepage&amp;q=ancient%20grain%20trade&amp;f=false|author=Lesley Adkins, Roy A.

In [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], many scholars documented farming techniques, including the use of fertilizers.&lt;ref name=FertMan/&gt; Much of what was believed about farming and plant nutrition at this time was later found to be incorrect, but their theories provided the scientific foundation for the development of agricultural theories through the [[Middle Ages]]. Ideas about soil fertility and fertilization remained much the same from the time of Greco-Roman scholars until the 19th century, with correspondingly low crop yields.&lt;ref name=FertMan/&gt; By the time of [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquests (330–323 BC), the role of horses had developed, and they played a huge role in warfare and agriculture. Innovations continued to be developed which allowed them to work longer, harder and more efficiently.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Crescenzi calendar.jpg|thumb|Agricultural calendar from a manuscript of [[Pietro de Crescenzi]].]]

The Middle Ages saw significant improvements in the agricultural techniques and technology. During this time period, monasteries spread throughout Europe and became important centers for the collection of knowledge related to agriculture and forestry. The [[manorial system]], which existed under different names throughout Europe and Asia, allowed large landowners significant control over both their land and its laborers, in the form of peasants or [[serf]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hcs/TMI/HCS210/HortOrigins/MiddleAges.html|title=Medieval Horticulture/Agriculture|publisher=Ohio State University|accessdate=24 April 2013|author=Jourdan, Pablo}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the medieval period, the [[Arab world]] was critical in the exchange of crops and technology between the European, Asia and African continents. Besides transporting numerous crops, they introduced the concept of summer irrigation to Europe and developed the beginnings of the [[plantation]] system of [[sugarcane]] growing through the use of slaves for intensive cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/hort_306/text/lec22.pdf|title=Islamic Influences on Western Agriculture|author=Janick, Jules|year=2008|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Population continued to increase along with land use.

By 900 AD in Europe, developments in [[smelting|iron smelting]] allowed for increased production, leading to developments in the production of agricultural implements such as ploughs, hand tools and [[horse shoe]]s. The plough was significantly improved, developing into the [[mouldboard plough#Mouldboard plough|mouldboard plough]], capable of turning over the heavy, wet soils of northern Europe. This led to the clearing of forests in that area and a significant increase in agricultural production, which in turn led to an increase in population.&lt;ref name=Backer/&gt; A similar plough, which may have developed independently, was also found in China as early as the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=SaJlbWK_-FcC&amp;pg=PA270&amp;lpg=PA270&amp;dq=medieval+china+agriculture#v=onepage&amp;q=medieval%20china%20agriculture&amp;f=false|author=Glick, Thomas F.|page=270|title=Medieval Science, Technology And Medicine: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2005|isbn=0-415-96930-1|series=Volume 11 of The Routledge Encyclopedias of the Middle Ages Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, farmers in Europe moved from a two field [[crop rotation]] to a three field crop rotation in which one field of three was left fallow every year. This resulted in increased productivity and nutrition, as the change in rotations led to different crops being planted, including [[legumes]] such as peas, lentils and beans. Inventions such as improved [[horse harness]]es and the [[whippletree (mechanism)|whippletree]] also changed methods of cultivation.&lt;ref name=Backer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engr.sjsu.edu/pabacker/history/middle.htm|title=Part 1 – Medieval European history |author= Backer, Patricia|publisher=San Jose State University|accessdate=24 April 2013|work=History of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Watermill]]s were initially developed by the Romans, but were improved throughout the Middle Ages, along with [[windmill]]s, and used to grind grains into flour, cut wood and process flax and wool, among other uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=1-mss7-OStgC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=development+of+watermills+and+windmills#v=onepage&amp;q=development%20of%20watermills%20and%20windmills&amp;f=false|title=Daily Life in the Middle Ages|author=Newman, Paul B.|pages=88–89|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-7864-5052-5|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global exchange===
[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder- The Harvesters - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[The Harvesters (painting)|The Harvesters]]''. [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]] – 1565]]
After 1492, a [[Columbian exchange|global exchange]] of previously local crops and livestock breeds occurred. Key crops involved in this exchange included [[maize]], potatoes, [[sweet potatoes]] and [[manioc]] traveling from the New World to the Old, and several varieties of wheat, barley, rice and [[turnip]]s going from the Old World to the New. There were very few livestock species in the New World, with horses, cattle, sheep and goats being completely unknown before their arrival with Old World settlers. Crops moving in both directions across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] caused population growth around the world, and had a lasting effect on many cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/american-indians/essays/columbian-exchange|title=The Columbian Exchange|publisher=The Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History|author=Crosby, Alfred|accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its introduction from South America to Spain in the late 1500s, the potato became an important staple crop throughout Europe by the late 1700s. The potato allowed farmers to produce more food, and initially added variety to the European diet. The nutrition boost caused by increased potato consumption resulted in lower disease rates, higher birth rates and lower mortality rates, causing a population boom throughout the [[British Empire]], the US and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.history-magazine.com/potato.html |title=The Impact of the Potato|journal=History Magazine|author=Chapman, Jeff|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of the potato also brought about the first intensive use of fertilizer, in the form of [[guano]] imported to Europe from Peru, and the first artificial pesticide, in the form of an [[arsenic]] compound used to fight [[Colorado potato beetle]]s. Before the adoption of the potato as a major crop, the dependence on grain caused repetitive regional and national [[famine]]s when the crops failed: 17 major famines in England alone between 1523 and 1623. Although initially almost eliminating the danger of famine, the resulting dependence on the potato eventually caused the [[European Potato Failure]], a disastrous crop failure from [[potato blight|disease]] resulting in widespread famine, and the death of over one million people in Ireland alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/How-the-Potato-Changed-the-World.html|title=How the Potato Changed History|author=Mann, Charles C.|journal=Smithsonian|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Agricultural Revolution, with its massive increases in agricultural productivity and net output, is a topic of ongoing debate among historians and agricultural scholars. The changes in agriculture in Britain between the 16th and 19th centuries would subsequently affect agriculture around the world. Major points of development included [[enclosure]], [[mechanization]], [[crop rotation]] and [[selective breeding]]. Prior to the 1960s, historians viewed the British Agricultural Revolution of having been &quot;largely facilitated by a small number of key innovators,&quot; including [[Robert Bakewell (farmer)|Robert Bakewell]],&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://lra.le.ac.uk/handle/2381/1407|title=Zooarchaeology, improvement and the British agricultural revolution|author=Thomas, Richard M.|journal=International Journal of Historical Archaeology|date= June 2005|volume=9|issue=2|pages=71–88|doi=10.1007/s10761-005-8140-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (seventh creation)|Thomas Coke]] and [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Charles Townshend]]. However, modern historians disperse much of the importance surrounding these individual men, and instead point to them holding a smaller position within a major societal shift regarding agriculture in Britain.

The agricultural changes, along with industrialization and migration, allowed the population of Britain, as well as other countries who followed its model, such as the US, Germany and Belgium, to escape from the [[Malthusian trap]] and increase both their population and their [[standard of living]]. It is estimated that the productivity of wheat in England went up from about 19 bushels per acre in 1720 to 21–22 bushels by the middle of the century and finally stabilized at around 30 bushels by 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Snell|first=K.D.M|title=Annals of the Labouring Poor, Social Change and Agrarian England 1660–1900|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=0-521-24548-6}} Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kingsbury&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Noel Kingsbury|year=2009|title=Hybrid: The History and Science of Plant Breeding|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=doItXV8UN1oC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=Malthusian+trap+and+British+Agricultural+Revolution&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WUQC5GLeAe&amp;sig=ztY4ANuKHDcN9JL73JEzGZ1MsqU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=92jYUsH5FcH42QX3tIDwAQ&amp;ved=0CGIQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Malthusian%20trap%20and%20British%20Agricultural%20Revolution&amp;f=false|title=Preparing for the 21st century|author=Kennedy, Paul|page=11|publisher=Random House|year=2011|isbn=0-307-77357-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Premodern agriculture across [[Europe]] was characterized by the [[feudal]] [[open field system]], where farmers worked on strips of land in fields that were held in common; this was inefficient and reduced the incentive to improve productivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=J. M.|last=Neeson|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2CqhjjiwLtEC|title=Commoners: Common Right, Enclosure and Social Change in England, 1700–1820|isbn=0-521-56774-2|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1996|pages=11–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many farms began to be [[enclosure movement|enclosed]] by [[yeomen]] who improved the use of their land. This process of [[land reform]] accelerated in the 18th century with special acts of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] to expedite the legal process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw-Taylor 2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|first=Leigh|last=Shaw-Taylor|title=Parliamentary Enclosure and the Emergence of an English Agricultural Proletariat|journal=[[Journal of Economic History]]|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consolidation of large, privately owned holdings, encouraged the improvement of productivity through experimentation by enterprising landowners. By the 1750s, the market for agriculture was substantially commercialized - crop surpluses were routinely sold by the producers on the market or exported elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shaw-Taylor 2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gregory&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5liCbG4J9LYC|title=The Dictionary of Human Geography|editor=Derek Gregory, Ron Johnston, Geraldine Pratt, Michael Watts, Sarah Whatmore|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These social changes were coupled with technical improvements. New methods of crop rotation and land use resulted in large additions to the amount of [[arable land]]. The [[four-field crop rotation]] was popularized by [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Charles Townshend]] in the 18th century. The system ([[wheat]], [[turnip]]s, [[barley]] and [[clover]]), opened up a fodder crop and grazing crop allowing [[livestock]] to be bred year-round. Yields of [[cereal]] crops increased as farmers utilized [[nitrogen]]-rich manure and [[nitrogen fixing]]-crops such as [[clover]], increasing the available nitrogen in the soil and removing the limiting factor on cereal productions that had existed prior to the early 19th century. This improved production per farmer led to an increase in population and in the available workforce, creating the labor force needed for the [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/agricultural_revolution_01.shtml|title=Agricultural Revolution in England 1500–1850|author=Overton, Mark|date=2 February 2011|accessdate=16 January 2014|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of agriculture into its modern form was made possible through a continuing process of [[mechanised agriculture|mechanization]].&lt;ref name=ASRM/&gt; Prior to this, basic agricultural tools had slowly been improved over centuries of use. The plough, for example, was a heavy implement with wheels in the 1500s. By the 1600s it was lighter, and by 1730, the [[Plough#History|Rotherham plough]] dramatically changed farming with no wheels, [[interchangeable parts]], stronger construction and less weight. During the early 1800s, [[cast iron]] replaced wood for many parts, leading to longer-lasting implements. [[Seed drill]]s had been under development since the early 1500s, but it was [[Jethro Tull (agriculturist)|Jethro Tull]]'s 1731 invention of a horse-drawn seed drill and horse hoe (a small plough to hoe between crop rows) that would eventually revolutionize planting in Britain, although they would not become popular until the early 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nj8ixXhFgLAC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=seed+drill+invention&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YnbYUtCJKIaTyQG_g4GYBg&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=seed%20drill%20invention&amp;f=false|title=Agricultural Revolution in England: The Transformation of the Agrarian Economy 1500–1850|pages=121–122|author=Overton, Mark|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1996|isbn=0-521-56859-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Meikle]] patented the first practical [[threshing machine]] in 1784.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tityMquMYUsC|title=Scottish Agricultural Implements|author=Bob Powell|year=1988|publisher=Osprey Publishing|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Industrial Revolution]] caused a boom in international trade and shipping. Increased production caused a rise in the need for raw materials, with European merchants purchasing the majority of the goods. The value of goods traded worldwide increased by five times between 1750 and 1914, with annual shipping tonnages increasing from 4 million to 30 million tons between 1800 and 1900. In the second half of the 19th century, trade also expanded in the food (including grain and meat) and wool markets, and England (with the repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] in 1846) began to trade quantities of industrial products for wheat from around the world. The vast expansion of [[railroad]]s that followed the invention of the [[steam engine]] further revolutionized world trade, especially in the Americas and East Asia, as goods could now be more easily traded across vast land distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackstudies.ucsb.edu/antillians/trade2.html|title=European Trade|publisher=University of California, Santa Barbara|accessdate=13 September 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602065501/http://www.blackstudies.ucsb.edu/antillians/trade2.html|archivedate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developments of [[food processing|heat processing]] and [[refrigeration]] in the 19th century led to a similar revolution in the meat industry, as they allowed meat to be shipped long distances without spoiling.

In the mid-1800s, horse drawn machinery, such as the [[McCormick reaper]], revolutionized harvesting, while inventions such as the [[cotton gin]] made possible the processing of large amounts of crops. During this same period, farmers began to use [[Traction engine|steam-powered]] [[threshing machine|threshers]] and [[tractor]]s, although they were found to be expensive, dangerous and a fire hazard. The first [[gasoline engine|gasoline-powered]] tractors were successfully developed around 1900, and in 1923, the [[International Harvester]] [[Farmall]] tractor became the first all-purpose tractor, and marked a major point in the replacement of draft animals (particularly horses) with machines. Since that time, self-propelled mechanical harvesters ([[combine harvester|combines]]), planters, transplanters and other equipment have been developed, further revolutionizing agriculture.&lt;ref name=ASRM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/hort_306/text/lec32.pdf|title=Agricultural Scientific Revolution: Mechanical|author=Janick, Jules|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These inventions allowed farming tasks to be done with a speed and on a scale previously impossible, leading modern farms to output much greater volumes of high-quality produce per land unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nae.edu/Publications/Bridge/52548/52645.aspx|title=The Impact of Mechanization on Agriculture|journal=The Bridge on Agriculture and Information Technology|date=Fall 2011|volume=41|author=Reid, John F.|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific investigation of fertilization began at the [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]] in 1843 by [[John Bennet Lawes]]. He developed the first commercial process for fertilizer production - the obtaining of ''[[super phosphate|phosphate]]'' from the dissolution of [[coprolite]]s in [[sulphuric acid]].&lt;ref&gt;Coprolite Fertilizer Industry in Britain [http://www.pdmhs.com/PDFs/ScannedBulletinArticles/Bulletin%2014-5%20-%20The%20Origins%20and%20Development%20of%20the%20British%20.pdf] Accessed 3 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 the revolutionary [[Haber-Bosch]] method to synthesize [[ammonium nitrate]] was first demonstrated; it represented a major breakthrough and allowed [[crop yields]] to overcome previous constraints.

Despite the tremendous gains in agricultural productivity, famines continued to sweep the globe through the 20th century.

The Green Revolution refers to a series of research, development, and [[technology transfer]] initiatives, occurring between the 1940s and the late 1970s, that increased agriculture production around the world, beginning most markedly in the late 1960s.

Although the Green Revolution significantly increased rice yields in Asia, yield increases have not occurred in the past 15–20 years.

They in part base this on the experience of Vietnam, which went from a food importer to large food exporter and saw a significant drop in poverty, due mainly to the development of smallholder agriculture in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifad.org/operations/food/farmer.htm|title=Food prices: smallholder farmers can be part of the solution|publisher=International Fund for Agricultural Development|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disease and land degradation are two of the major concerns in agriculture today. For example, an epidemic of [[stem rust]] on wheat caused by the [[Ug99]] lineage is currently spreading across Africa and into Asia and is causing major concerns due to crop losses of 70% or more under some conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/agriculture/crops/rust/stem/rust-report/stem-ug99racettksk/en/|title=Wheat Stem Rust – UG99 (Race TTKSK)|publisher=FAO|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 40% of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded.&lt;ref&gt;Sample, Ian (31 August 2007).

In 2009, the [[Agriculture in China|agricultural output of China]] was the largest in the world, followed by the European Union, India and the United States, according to the [[International Monetary Fund]] (''[[Agriculture#List of countries by agricultural output|see below]]''). Economists measure the [[total factor productivity]] of agriculture and by this measure agriculture in the United States is roughly 1.7 times more productive than it was in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=USDA Economic Research Service|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/data/agproductivity/ |title=Agricultural Productivity in the United States|date=5 July 2012|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workforce==
{{as of|2011}}, the [[International Labour Organization]] states that approximately one billion people, or over 1/3 of the available work force, are employed in the global agricultural sector. Agriculture constitutes approximately 70% of the global employment of children, and in many countries employs the largest percentage of women of any industry.&lt;ref name=ILO/&gt; The [[service sector]] only overtook the agricultural sector as the largest global employer in 2007. Between 1997 and 2007, the percentage of people employed in agriculture fell by over four percentage points, a trend that is expected to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/story/191279|title=Services sector overtakes farming as world's biggest employer: ILO|author=AP|date=26 January 2007|accessdate=24 April 2013|publisher=''The Financial Express''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of people employed in agriculture varies widely on a per-country basis, ranging from less than 2% in countries like the US and Canada to over 80% in many African nations.&lt;ref name=LaborForce&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2048.html|title=Labor Force – By Occupation|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|work=The World Factbook|accessdate=4 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In developed countries, these figures are significantly lower than in previous centuries. During the 16th century in Europe, for example, between 55 and 75 percent of the population was engaged in agriculture, depending on the country. By the 19th century in Europe, this had dropped to between 35 and 65 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://economics.ouls.ox.ac.uk/13621/1/uuid9ef3c3c6-512f-44b6-b74e-53266cc42ae2-ATTACHMENT01.pdf|format=PDF|title=Economic structure and agricultural productivity in Europe, 1300–1800|journal=European Review of Economic History|volume=3|pages=1–25|author=Allen, Robert C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same countries today, the figure is less than 10%.&lt;ref name=LaborForce/&gt;

===Safety===
[[File:Ford Tractor with ROPS bar fitted.JPG|right|thumb|[[Rollover protection system|Rollover protection bar]] on a [[Fordson tractor]]]]

Agriculture remains a hazardous industry, and farmers worldwide remain at high risk of work-related injuries, lung disease, [[noise-induced hearing loss]], skin diseases, as well as certain cancers related to chemical use and prolonged sun exposure. On [[industrial agriculture|industrialized farms]], injuries frequently involve the use of [[agricultural machinery]], and a common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in developed countries is tractor rollovers.&lt;ref name=&quot;aginjury&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/aginjury/ |title=NIOSH Workplace Safety &amp; Health Topic: Agricultural Injuries|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can also be hazardous to worker health, and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illness or have children with birth defects.&lt;ref name=NIOSH_pest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2012-108/ |title=NIOSH Pesticide Poisoning Monitoring Program Protects Farmworkers|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an industry in which families commonly share in work and live on the farm itself, entire families can be at risk for injuries, illness, and death.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIOSH Agri&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/agriculture/ |title=NIOSH Workplace Safety &amp; Health Topic: Agriculture|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common causes of fatal injuries among young farm workers include drowning, machinery and motor vehicle-related accidents.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIOSH Agri&quot; /&gt;

The International Labour Organization considers agriculture &quot;one of the most hazardous of all economic sectors.&quot;&lt;ref name=ILO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/safework/info/standards-and-instruments/codes/WCMS_161135/lang--en/index.htm|title=Safety and health in agriculture|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=24 April 2013|date=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It estimates that the annual work-related death toll among agricultural employees is at least 170,000, twice the average rate of other jobs. In addition, incidences of death, injury and illness related to agricultural activities often go unreported.&lt;ref name=ILO2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/safework/areasofwork/hazardous-work/WCMS_110188/lang--en/index.htm|title=Agriculture: A hazardous work|publisher=International Labour Organization|accessdate=24 April 2013|date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has developed the [[Safety and Health in Agriculture Convention, 2001]], which covers the range of risks in the agriculture occupation, the prevention of these risks and the role that individuals and organizations engaged in agriculture should play.&lt;ref name=ILO/&gt;

==Agricultural production systems==

===Crop cultivation systems===
[[File:Paddy fields in India.jpg|thumb|Rice cultivation at a paddy field in [[Bihar]] state of India]]
[[File:Rice terraces.png|thumb|The [[Banaue Rice Terraces]] in [[Ifugao]], Philippines]]
Cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints; geography and climate of the farm; government policy; economic, social and political pressures; and the philosophy and culture of the farmer.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO FS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization|url=http://www.fao.org/farmingsystems/description_en.htm|title=Analysis of farming systems|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP APS&quot;&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. Agricultural Production Systems. pp. 283–317 in &quot;Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology&quot;. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shifting cultivation]] (or [[slash and burn]]) is a system in which forests are burnt, releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then [[perennial plant|perennial]] crops for a period of several years.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;&gt;Chrispeels, M.J.; Sadava, D.E. 1994. &quot;Farming Systems: Development, Productivity, and Sustainability&quot;. pp. 25–57 in ''Plants, Genes, and Agriculture''. Jones and Bartlett, Boston, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest, and the farmer moves to a new plot, returning after many more years (10–20). This fallow period is shortened if population density grows, requiring the input of nutrients (fertilizer or [[manure]]) and some manual [[pest control]]. Annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period. This requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs.

Further industrialization led to the use of [[monoculture]]s, when one [[cultivar]] is planted on a large acreage. Because of the low [[biodiversity]], nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up, necessitating the greater use of [[pesticide]]s and fertilizers.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP APS&quot;/&gt; Multiple cropping, in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year, and [[intercropping]], when several crops are grown at the same time, are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as [[polyculture]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot; /&gt;

In [[subtropics|subtropical]] and [[arid]] environments, the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall, either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year, or requiring [[irrigation]]. In all of these environments perennial crops are grown (coffee, chocolate) and systems are practiced such as [[agroforestry]]. In [[Temperateness|temperate]] environments, where ecosystems were predominantly [[grassland]] or [[prairie]], highly productive annual cropping is the dominant farming system.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;/&gt;

===Livestock production systems===
{{Main|Livestock}}
{{See also|List of domesticated animals}}
[[File:KerbauJawa.jpg|thumb|right|Ploughing rice paddies with [[water buffalo]], in Indonesia]]
Animals, including horses, [[mule]]s, [[ox]]en, [[water buffalo]], [[camel]]s, [[llama]]s, [[alpaca]]s, [[donkey]]s, and dogs, are often used to help [[Tillage|cultivate]] fields, [[harvest]] crops, wrangle other animals, and transport farm products to buyers. [[Animal husbandry]] not only refers to the breeding and raising of animals for meat or to harvest animal products (like milk, [[egg (food)|eggs]], or [[wool]]) on a continual basis, but also to the breeding and care of species for work and companionship.

Livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source, as [[grassland]]-based, mixed, and landless.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO lps&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Sere, C.; Steinfeld, H.; Groeneweld, J.|year=1995|url=http://www.fao.org/WAIRDOCS/LEAD/X6101E/x6101e00.htm#Contents|title=Description of Systems in World Livestock Systems – Current status issues and trends|publisher=U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization|accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2010}}, 30% of Earth's ice- and water-free area was used for producing livestock, with the sector employing approximately 1.3 billion people. Between the 1960s and the 2000s, there was a significant increase in livestock production, both by numbers and by carcass weight, especially among beef, pigs and chickens, the latter of which had production increased by almost a factor of 10. Non-meat animals, such as milk cows and egg-producing chickens, also showed significant production increases. Global cattle, sheep and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through 2050.&lt;ref name=LP&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1554/2853.full|title=Livestock production: recent trends, future prospects|author=Thornton, Philip K.|doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0134|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B|date=27 September 2010|volume=365|number= 1554}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aquaculture]] or fish farming, the production of fish for human consumption in confined operations, is one of the fastest growing sectors of food production, growing at an average of 9% a year between 1975 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1663604,00.html|title=Fish Farming's Growing Dangers|journal=Time|author=Stier, Ken|date=19 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second half of the 20th century, producers using [[selective breeding]] focused on creating livestock [[breed]]s and [[crossbreed]]s that increased production, while mostly disregarding the need to preserve [[genetic diversity]]. This trend has led to a significant decrease in genetic diversity and resources among livestock breeds, leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional breeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A global view of livestock biodiversity and conservation – GLOBALDIV|author=P. Ajmone-Marsan|journal=Animal Genetics|date=May 2010|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2052.2010.02036.x|volume=41| issue = supplement S1|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as [[shrubland]], [[rangeland]], and [[managed intensive rotational grazing|pastures]] for feeding [[ruminant]] animals. Outside nutrient inputs may be used, however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source. This system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil, representing 30–40 million pastoralists.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;/&gt; Mixed production systems use grassland, [[fodder]] crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastric (one stomach; mainly chickens and pigs) livestock. Manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO lps&quot;/&gt;

Landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm, representing the de-linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]](OECD) member countries. Synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure utilization becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAO lps&quot;/&gt; Industrialized countries use these operations to produce much of the global supplies of poultry and pork. Scientists estimate that 75% of the growth in livestock production between 2003 and 2030 will be in [[confined animal feeding operations]], sometimes called [[factory farming]]. Much of this growth is happening in developing countries in Asia, with much smaller amounts of growth in Africa.&lt;ref name=LP/&gt; Some of the practices used in commercial livestock production, including the usage of [[growth hormone]]s, are controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-02-604_en.pdf |title=Growth Promoting Hormones Pose Health Risk to Consumers, Confirms EU Scientific Committee|date=23 April 2002|accessdate=6 April 2013|publisher=European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production practices==
[[File:Mt Uluguru and Sisal plantations.jpg|thumb|300px|Road leading across the farm allows machinery access to the farm for production practices.]]
[[Tillage]] is the practice of plowing soil to prepare for planting or for nutrient incorporation or for pest control. Tillage varies in intensity from conventional to [[no-till farming|no-till]]. It may improve productivity by warming the soil, incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds, but also renders soil more prone to erosion, triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soil&quot;&gt;Brady, N.C. and R.R. Weil. 2002. Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils.

Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pest control]] includes the management of weeds, [[insect]]s, [[mite]]s, and diseases. Chemical ([[pesticide]]s), biological ([[biocontrol]]), mechanical (tillage), and cultural practices are used. Cultural practices include [[crop rotation]], [[culling]], [[cover crop]]s, [[intercropping]], [[composting]], avoidance, and [[Disease resistance in fruit and vegetables|resistance]]. [[Integrated pest management]] attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss, and recommends pesticides as a last resort.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP Pest&quot;&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. &quot;Pesticide Use in U.S. Crop Production&quot; pp.240–282 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nutrient management]] includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production, and the method of utilization of [[manure]] produced by livestock. Nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers, [[manure]], [[green manure]], [[compost]] and mined [[minerals]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP Soil&quot;&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. &quot;Soil and Land&quot; pp.165–210 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; Crop nutrient use may also be managed using cultural techniques such as crop rotation or a [[fallow]] period.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS nutrient&quot;&gt;Chrispeels, M.J.; Sadava, D.E. 1994. &quot;Nutrition from the Soil&quot; pp.187–218 in ''Plants, Genes, and Agriculture''.

Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; Manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is growing, such as in [[managed intensive rotational grazing]], or [[Manure spreader|by spreading]] either dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland or [[pasture]]s.

[[Water management]] is needed where rainfall is insufficient or variable, which occurs to some degree in most regions of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;/&gt; Some farmers use [[irrigation]] to supplement rainfall. In other areas such as the [[Great Plains]] in the U.S. and Canada, farmers use a [[fallow]] year to conserve soil moisture to use for growing a crop in the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCP Water&quot;&gt;Acquaah, G. 2002. &quot;Plants and Soil Water&quot; pp.211–239 in ''Principles of Crop Production, Theories, Techniques and Technology''.

According to a report by the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]], agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other; using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity, food security and trade by 2050, the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as 40% and food prices could be reduced by almost half.&lt;ref name=ifpri&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpri.org/publication/food-security-world-natural-resource-scarcity|author=International Food Policy Research Institute|title=Food Security in a World of Growing Natural Resource Scarcity|year=2014|publisher=CropLife International|accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;[[Payment for ecosystem services]] (PES) can further incentivise efforts to green the agriculture sector. This is an approach that verifies values and rewards the benefits of ecosystem services provided by green agricultural practices.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, www.unep.org/greeneconomy &lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Innovative PES measures could include reforestation payments made by cities to upstream communities in rural areas of shared watersheds for improved quantities and quality of fresh water for municipal users. Ecoservice payments by farmers to upstream forest stewards for properly managing the flow of soil nutrients, and methods to monetise the carbon sequestration and emission reduction credit benefits of green agriculture practices in order to compensate farmers for their efforts to restore and build SOM and employ other practices.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, www.unep.org/greeneconomy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crop alteration and biotechnology==
{{Main|Plant breeding}}
[[File:Ueberladewagen (jha).jpg|thumb|[[Tractor]] and [[chaser bin]]]]
Crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years, since the beginning of civilization. Altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make-up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans, for example, larger fruits or seeds, drought-tolerance, or resistance to pests. Significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist [[Gregor Mendel]]. His work on [[dominant allele|dominant]] and [[recessive allele]]s, although initially largely ignored for almost 50 years, gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques. Crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits, [[self-pollination]] and [[cross-pollination]], and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cls.casa.colostate.edu/TransgenicCrops/history.html |title=History of Plant Breeding|date=29 January 2004|publisher=Colorado State University|accessdate=11 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestication of plants has, over the centuries increased yield, improved [[disease resistance in fruit and vegetables|disease resistance]] and [[drought tolerance]], eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants. Careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture (grasses and clover) in [[New Zealand]]. Extensive X-ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive genetic engineering) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn (maize) and barley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Stadler |first= L.

The [[Green Revolution]] popularized the use of conventional [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] to sharply increase yield by creating &quot;high-yielding varieties&quot;. For example, average yields of corn (maize) in the USA have increased from around 2.5 tons per hectare (t/ha) (40 bushels per acre) in 1900 to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels per acre) in 2001. Similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t/ha in 1900 to more than 2.5 t/ha in 1990. South American average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha, African under 1 t/ha, and Egypt and Arabia up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation. In contrast, the average wheat yield in countries such as France is over 8 t/ha.

[[Genetically modified organism]]s (GMO) are [[organism]]s whose [[Genetics|genetic]] material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as [[recombinant DNA technology]]. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/biotech/20questions/en/index.html|title=20 Questions on Genetically Modified Foods|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some, GMO crops cause [[food safety]] and [[food labeling regulations|food labeling]] concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import and/or use of GMO foods and crops, which have been put in place due to concerns over potential health issues, declining agricultural diversity and contamination of non-GMO crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://current.com/groups/news-blog/93975745_peru-bans-genetically-modified-foods-as-us-lags.htm|title=Peru bans genetically modified foods as US lags|date=28 November 2012|publisher=Current TV|accessdate=7 May 2013|author=Whiteside, Stephanie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently a global treaty, the [[Biosafety Protocol]], regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shiva, Vandana|title=Earth Democracy: Justice, Sustainability, and Peace|publisher=[[South End Press]]|location= Cambridge, MA|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including [[glyphosate]]s. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y5031e/y5031e0i.htm|title=Benefits and risks of the use of herbicide-resistant crops|author=Kathrine Hauge Madsen and Jens Carl Streibig|publisher=FAO|accessdate=4 May 2013|work=Weed Management for Developing Countries}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays.

Agriculture imposes [[externality|external costs]] upon society through pesticides, nutrient runoff, excessive water usage, loss of natural environment and assorted other problems. A 2000 assessment of agriculture in the UK determined total external costs for 1996 of £2,343 million, or £208 per hectare.&lt;ref name=Pretty2000&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Pretty |year= 2000 |title= An assessment of the total external costs of UK agriculture |journal= Agricultural Systems |volume= 65 |issue= 2 |pages= 113–136 |doi= 10.1016/S0308-521X(00)00031-7 |first1= J |display-authors= 1 |last2= Brett |first2= C. |last3= Gee |first3= D. |last4= Hine |first4= R.E. |last5= Mason |first5= C.F. |last6= Morison |first6= J.I.L. |last7= Raven |first7= H. |last8= Rayment |first8= M.D. |last9= Van Der Bijl |first9= G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 analysis of these costs in the USA concluded that cropland imposes approximately $5 to 16 billion ($30 to $96 per hectare), while livestock production imposes $714 million.&lt;ref name=Tegtmeier2005&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Tegtmeier |first1= E.M. |last2= Duffy |first2= M. |year= 2005 |title= External Costs of Agricultural Production in the United States |journal= The Earthscan Reader in Sustainable Agriculture |url= http://www.organicvalley.coop/fileadmin/pdf/ag_costs_IJAS2004.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both studies, which focused solely on the fiscal impacts, concluded that more should be done to internalize external costs. Neither included subsidies in their analysis, but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society.&lt;ref name=Pretty2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tegtmeier2005/&gt; In 2010, the [[International Resource Panel]] of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] published a report assessing the environmental impacts of consumption and production. The study found that agriculture and food consumption are two of the most important drivers of environmental pressures, particularly habitat change, climate change, water use and toxic emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/resourcepanel/Publications/PriorityProducts/tabid/56053/Default.aspx |title=Priority products and materials: assessing the environmental impacts of consumption and production|author=International Resource Panel|publisher=United Nations Environment Programme|year=2010|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 UNEP Green Economy report states that &quot;[a]gricultural operations, excluding land use changes, produce approximately 13 per cent of anthropogenic global GHG emissions. This includes GHGs emitted by the use of inorganic fertilisers agro-chemical pesticides and herbicides; (GHG emissions resulting from production of these inputs are included in industrial emissions); and fossil fuel-energy inputs. &lt;ref&gt;UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, www.unep.org/greeneconomy&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;On average we find that the total amount of fresh residues from agricultural and forestry production for second- generation biofuel production amounts to 3.8 billion tonnes per year between 2011 and 2050 (with an average annual growth rate of 11 per cent throughout the period analysed, accounting for higher growth during early years, 48 per cent for 2011-2020 and an average 2 per cent annual expansion after 2020).&quot; &lt;ref&gt;UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, www.unep.org/greeneconomy &lt;/ref&gt;

===Livestock issues===
A senior UN official and co-author of a UN report detailing this problem, Henning Steinfeld, said &quot;Livestock are one of the most significant contributors to today's most serious environmental problems&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html |title=Livestock a major threat to environment |publisher=UN Food and Agriculture Organization |date=29 November 2006 |accessdate=24 April 2013|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080328062709/http%3A//www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000448/index.html |archivedate= 28 March 2008|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Livestock production occupies 70% of all land used for agriculture, or 30% of the land surface of the planet. It is one of the largest sources of [[greenhouse gas]]es, responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents. By comparison, all transportation emits 13.5% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It produces 65% of human-related [[nitrous oxide]] (which has 296 times the global warming potential of CO&lt;sub&gt;2,&lt;/sub&gt;) and 37% of all human-induced [[methane]] (which is 23 times as warming as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.) It also generates 64% of the [[ammonia]] emission. Livestock expansion is cited as a key factor driving [[deforestation]]; in the Amazon basin 70% of [[Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest|previously forested area]] is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feedcrops.&lt;ref name=&quot;LEAD&quot;&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080625012113/http://www.virtualcentre.org/en/library/key_pub/longshad/A0701E00.pdf |archivedate=25 June 2008 |last1=Steinfeld |first1=H. |last2=Gerber |first2=P. |last3=Wassenaar |first3=T. |last4=Castel |first4=V. |last5=Rosales |first5=M. |last6=de Haan |first6=C. |year=2006 |publisher=U.N.

Furthermore, the UNEP states that &quot;methane emissions from global livestock are projected to increase by 60 per cent by 2030 under current practices and consumption patterns.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, www.unep.org/greeneconomy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land and water issues===

Land transformation, the use of land to yield goods and services, is the most substantial way humans alter the Earth's ecosystems, and is considered the driving force in the loss of biodiversity.

[[Eutrophication]], excessive nutrients in [[aquatic ecosystem]]s resulting in [[algal bloom]]s and [[anoxic waters|anoxia]], leads to [[fish kill]]s, loss of biodiversity, and renders water unfit for drinking and other industrial uses. Excessive fertilization and manure application to cropland, as well as high livestock stocking densities cause nutrient (mainly [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]) [[surface runoff|runoff]] and [[leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] from agricultural land. These nutrients are major [[nonpoint source pollution|nonpoint pollutants]] contributing to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eutr&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Carpenter, S.R., N.F.

===Pesticides===
{{main|Environmental impact of pesticides}}
Pesticide use has increased since 1950 to 2.5 million tons annually worldwide, yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pimentel pesticide&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Pimentel, D. T.W. Culliney, and T. Bashore|year=1996 |url=http://ipmworld.umn.edu/chapters/pimentel.htm |title=Public health risks associated with pesticides and natural toxins in foods |work=Radcliffe's IPM World Textbook|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Health Organization estimated in 1992 that 3 million pesticide poisonings occur annually, causing 220,000 deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHO&quot;&gt;WHO. 1992. Our planet, our health: Report of the WHO commission on health and environment. Geneva: World Health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; Pesticides select for [[pesticide resistance]] in the pest population, leading to a condition termed the 'pesticide treadmill' in which pest resistance warrants the development of a new pesticide.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS Pest&quot;&gt;Chrispeels, M.J. and D.E. Sadava. 1994. &quot;Strategies for Pest Control&quot; pp.355–383 in ''Plants, Genes, and Agriculture''. Jones and Bartlett, Boston, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative argument is that the way to 'save the environment' and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming, a view exemplified by a quote heading the Center for Global Food Issues website: 'Growing more per acre leaves more land for nature'.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAvery&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Avery, D.T.|year=2000|title=Saving the Planet with Pesticides and Plastic: The Environmental Triumph of High-Yield Farming|publisher=Hudson Institute|location=Indianapolis, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Center for Global Food Issues|url=http://www.cgfi.org/ |title=Home|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, critics argue that a trade-off between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable,&lt;ref name=&quot;WH&quot;&gt;Lappe, F.M., J. Collins, and P. Rosset. 1998. &quot;Myth 4: Food vs. Our Environment&quot; pp. 42–57 in ''World Hunger, Twelve Myths'', Grove Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; and that pesticides simply replace [[good agricultural practices|good agronomic practices]] such as crop rotation.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS Pest&quot;/&gt; The UNEP introduces the [[Push–pull agricultural pest management]] technique which involves intercropping that uses plant aromas to repel or push away pests while pulling in or attracting the right insects. &quot;The implementation of push-pull in eastern Africa has significantly increased maize yields and the combined cultivation of N-fixing forage crops has enriched the soil and has also provided farmers with feed for livestock. With increased livestock operations, the farmers are able to produce meat, milk and other dairy products and they use the manure as organic fertiliser that returns nutrients to the fields.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, www.unep.org/greeneconomy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate change===
{{see also|Climate change and agriculture}}
[[Climate change]] has the potential to affect agriculture through changes in temperature, rainfall (timing and quantity), [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[solar radiation]] and the interaction of these elements.&lt;ref name=&quot;CS&quot;/&gt; Extreme events, such as droughts and floods, are forecast to increase as climate change takes hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harvey, Fiona|date=18 November 2011|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2011/nov/18/extreme-weather-climate-change-ipcc|title=Extreme weather will strike as climate change takes hold, IPCC warns|journal=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture is among sectors most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change; water supply for example, will be critical to sustain agricultural production and provide the increase in food output required to sustain the world's growing population. Fluctuations in the flow of rivers are likely to increase in the twenty-first century. Based on the experience of countries in the Nile river basin (Ethiopia, Kenya and Sudan) and other developing countries, depletion of water resources during seasons crucial for agriculture can lead to a decline in yield by up to 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicforesight.com/publication_pdf/11374Nile%20concise.pdf|title=Report: Blue Peace for the Nile|publisher=Strategic Foresight Group|accessdate=20 August 2013|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transformational approaches will be needed to manage natural resources in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bs-agro.com/index.php/20152-pessimism-about-future-grows-in-agribusiness|title=World: Pessimism about future grows in agribusiness}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, policies, practices and tools promoting climate-smart agriculture will be important, as will better use of scientific information on climate for assessing risks and vulnerability. Planners and policy-makers will need to help create suitable policies that encourage funding for such agricultural transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]]|url=http://cdkn.org/resource/srex-lessons-for-the-agricultural-sector/?loclang=en_gb|title=SREX: Lessons for the agricultural sector|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agriculture can both mitigate or worsen [[global warming]]. Some of the increase in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] comes from the [[decomposition]] of [[organic matter]] in the soil, and much of the methane emitted into the atmosphere is caused by the decomposition of organic matter in wet soils such as [[rice paddy|rice paddies]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Soils OM&quot;&gt;Brady, N.C. and R.R. Weil. 2002. &quot;Soil Organic Matter&quot; pp. 353–385 in ''Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils''. Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the normal digestive activities of farm animals. Further, wet or [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] soils also lose nitrogen through [[denitrification]], releasing the greenhouse gases [[nitric oxide]] and nitrous oxide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soils N&quot;&gt;Brady, N.C. and R.R. Weil. 2002. &quot;Nitrogen and Sulfur Economy of Soils&quot; pp. 386–421 in ''Elements of the Nature and Properties of Soils''. Pearson Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in management can reduce the release of these greenhouse gases, and soil can further be used to [[carbon capture and storage|sequester]] some of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soils OM&quot;/&gt; Informed by the UNEP, &quot;[a]griculture also produces about 58 per cent of global nitrous oxide emissions and about 47 per cent of global methane emissions. Both of these gases have a far greater global warming potential per tonne than CO2 (298 times and 25 times respectively).&quot; &lt;ref&gt;UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, www.unep.org/greeneconomy&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several factors within the field of agriculture that contribute to the large amount of CO2 emissions. The diversity of the sources ranges from the production of farming tools to the transport of harvested produce. Approximately 8% of the national carbon footprint is due to agricultural sources. Of that, 75% is of the carbon emissions released from the production of crop assisting chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hillier|first=Jonathon|author2=C. Hawes|author3=G. Squire|author4=A. Hilton|title=The carbon footprints of food crop production|journal=International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability|year=2009|volume=7|issue=2|pages=107–118|doi=10.3763/ijas.2009.0419}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factories producing insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and fertilizers are a major culprit of the greenhouse gas. Productivity on the farm itself and the use of machinery is another source of the carbon emission. Almost all the industrial machines used in modern farming are powered by fossil fuels. These instruments are burning fossil fuels from the beginning of the process to the end. Tractors are the root of this source. The tractor is going to burn fuel and release CO2 just to run. The amount of emissions from the machinery increase with the attachment of different units and need for more power. During the soil preparation stage tillers and plows will be used to disrupt the soil. During growth watering pumps and sprayers are used to keep the crops hydrated. And when the crops are ready for picking a forage or combine harvester is used. These types of machinery all require additional energy which leads to increased carbon dioxide emissions from the basic tractors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lal|first=Rattan|title=Carbon emission from farm operations|journal=Environmental International|year=2004|volume=30|issue=7|pages=981–990|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2004.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final major contribution to CO2 emissions in agriculture is in the final transport of produce. Local farming suffered a decline over the past century due to large amounts of farm subsidies. The majority of crops are shipped hundreds of miles to various processing plants before ending up in the grocery store. These shipments are made using fossil fuel burning modes of transportation. Inevitably these transport adds to carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=West|first=T.O.|author2=G. Marland|title=Net carbon flux from agricultural ecosystems: methodology for full carbon cycle analyses|journal=Environmental Pollution|year=2002|volume=116|issue=3|pages=439–444|doi=10.1016/s0269-7491(01)00221-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability===
{{See also|List of sustainable agriculture topics}}
Some major organizations are hailing farming within [[agroecosystems]] as the way forward for mainstream agriculture. Current farming methods have resulted in over-stretched water resources, high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility. According to a report by the [[International Water Management Institute]] and [[UNEP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Boelee, E. (Ed)|url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/topics/ecosystems/|title=Ecosystems for water and food security|year=2011|publisher=IWMI/UNEP|accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is not enough water to continue farming using current practices; therefore how critical water, land, and [[ecosystem]] resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered. The report suggested assigning value to ecosystems, recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs, and balancing the rights of a variety of users and interests. Inequities that result when such measures are adopted would need to be addressed, such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich, the clearing of land to make way for

Agricultural economics refers to economics as it relates to the &quot;production, distribution and consumption of [agricultural] goods and services&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uidaho.edu/cals/aers/agriculturaleconomics|title=Agricultural Economics|publisher=University of Idaho|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining agricultural production with general theories of marketing and business as a discipline of study began in the late 1800s, and grew significantly through the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/13649/1/wp06-01.pdf|format=PDF|page=4|title=Agricultural Economics: A Brief Intellectual History|author=Runge, C.

This is related to the greater efficiency of farming, combined with the increased level of [[value added|value addition]] (e.g. more highly processed products) provided by the supply chain. [[Market concentration]] has increased in the sector as well, and although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency, the changes redistribute [[economic surplus]] from producers (farmers) and consumers, and may have negative implications for rural communities.&lt;ref name=Sexton2000&gt;{{cite journal |author= Sexton, R.J. |year= 2000 |title= Industrialization and Consolidation in the US Food Sector: Implications for Competition and Welfare |journal= American Journal of Agricultural Economics |volume= 82 |issue= 5 |pages= 1087–1104 |doi= 10.1111/0002-9092.00106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

National government policies can significantly change the economic marketplace for agricultural products, in the form of taxation, [[subsidies]], [[tariffs]] and other measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/4101/WPS4864.pdf?sequence=1|title=How Do Agricultural Policy Restrictions to Global Trade and Welfare Differ across Commodities?|author=Peter J.

In the 1980s, it was clear that non-subsidized farmers in developing countries were experiencing adverse affects from national policies that created artificially low global prices for farm products. Between the mid-1980s and the early 2000s, several international agreements were put into place that limited agricultural tariffs, subsidies and other trade restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/8699/wps3901.pdf?sequence=1|title=Do Global Trade Distortions Still Harm Developing Country Farmers?|author=Kym Anderson and Ernesto Valenzuela|work=World Bank Policy Research Working Paper 3901|date=April 2006|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=16 April 2013|pages=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, {{as of|2009|lc=y}}, there was still a significant amount of policy-driven distortion in global agricultural product prices. The three agricultural products with the greatest amount of trade distortion were sugar, milk and rice, mainly due to taxation. Among the [[oilseed]]s, sesame had the greatest amount of taxation, but overall, feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products. Since the 1980s, policy-driven distortions have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/4101/WPS4864.pdf?sequence=1|title=How Do Agricultural Policy Restrictions to Global Trade and Welfare Differ across Commodities?|author=Peter J.

== Energy and agriculture ==
Since the 1940s, agricultural productivity has increased dramatically, due largely to the increased use of energy-intensive mechanization, fertilizers and pesticides. The vast majority of this energy input comes from [[fossil fuel]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/world-oil-supplies-are-set-to-run-out-faster-than-expected-warn-scientists-453068.html World oil supplies are set to run out faster than expected, warn scientists]&quot;. ''The Independent''. 14 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 1960–65 measuring cycle and the cycle from 1986 to 1990, the [[Green Revolution]] transformed agriculture around the globe, with world grain production increasing significantly (between 70% and 390% for wheat and 60% to 150% for rice, depending on geographic area)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future of the Green Revolution: Implications for International Grain Markets|author=Robert W.

Modern agriculture's heavy reliance on [[petrochemicals]] and mechanization has raised concerns that oil shortages could increase costs and reduce agricultural output, causing food shortages.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncseonline.org&quot;/&gt;

Modern or industrialized agriculture is dependent on fossil fuels in two fundamental ways: 1) direct consumption on the farm and 2) indirect consumption to manufacture inputs used on the farm. Direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery; and use of gasoline, liquid [[propane]], and electricity to power dryers, pumps, lights, heaters, and coolers. American farms directly consumed about 1.2 exajoules (1.1 quadrillion BTU) in 2002, or just over 1% of the nation's total energy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncseonline.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Schnepf, Randy|date=19 November 2004|title=Energy use in Agriculture: Background and Issues|work=CRS Report for Congress|url=http://www.nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/assets/crs/RL32677.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]]|accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indirect consumption is mainly oil and [[natural gas]] used to manufacture fertilizers and pesticides, which accounted for 0.6 exajoules (0.6 quadrillion BTU) in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncseonline.org&quot;/&gt; The natural gas and coal consumed by the production of [[nitrogen fertilizer]] can account for over half of the agricultural energy usage. China utilizes mostly coal in the production of nitrogen fertilizer, while most of Europe uses large amounts of natural gas and small amounts of coal. According to a 2010 report published by [[The Royal Society]], agriculture is increasingly dependent on the direct and indirect input of fossil fuels. Overall, the fuels used in agriculture vary based on several factors, including crop, production system and location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/365/1554/2991.full|title=Energy and the food system|author=Jeremy Woods, Adrian Williams, John K.

Together, direct and indirect consumption by US farms accounts for about 2% of the nation's energy use. Direct and indirect energy consumption by U.S. farms peaked in 1979, and has gradually declined over the past 30 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncseonline.org&quot;/&gt; [[Food systems]] encompass not just agricultural production, but also off-farm processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, and disposal of food and food-related items. Agriculture accounts for less than one-fifth of food system energy use in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;css.snre.umich.edu&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ers.usda.gov&quot;/&gt;

===Mitigation of effects of petroleum shortages===
[[File:Hubbert peak oil plot.svg|right|thumb|250px|[[M. King Hubbert]]'s prediction of world petroleum production rates. Modern agriculture is totally reliant on petroleum energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/world-oil-supplies-are-set-to-run-out-faster-than-expected-warn-scientists-6262621.html|title=World oil supplies are set to run out faster than expected, warn scientists|journal=The Independent|date=14 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In the event of a petroleum shortage (see [[peak oil]] for global concerns), organic agriculture can be more attractive than conventional practices that use petroleum-based pesticides, herbicides, or fertilizers. Some studies using modern organic-farming methods have reported yields as high as those available from conventional farming.&lt;ref name=UMinnSustainable&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.misa.umn.edu/Search_and_Ask/FAQ/FeedtheWorld/index.htm|title=Can Sustainable Agriculture Really Feed the World?|date=August 2010|publisher=University of Minnesota|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], with shortages of conventional petroleum-based inputs, Cuba made use of mostly organic practices, including [[biopesticides]], plant-based pesticides and sustainable cropping practices, to feed its populace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chge.med.harvard.edu/resource/cuban-organic-farming-experiment|title=Cuban Organic Farming Experiment|publisher=Harvard School of Public Health|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, organic farming may be more [[labour (economics)|labor]]-intensive and would require a shift of the workforce from urban to rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Strochlic, R.; Sierra, L.|year=2007|url=http://ccwiki.pbworks.com/f/CAStudy-Barriers-Organic-CIRS-2007.pdf|title= Conventional, Mixed, and &quot;Deregistered&quot; Organic Farmers: Entry Barriers and Reasons for Exiting Organic Production in California|publisher=California Institute for Rural Studies|accessdate=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[soil conditioner|reconditioning of soil]] to restore nutrients lost during the use of [[monoculture]] agriculture techniques also takes time.&lt;ref name=UMinnSustainable/&gt;

It has been suggested that rural communities might obtain fuel from the [[biochar]] and [[synfuel]] process, which uses agricultural ''waste'' to provide charcoal fertilizer, some fuel ''and'' food, instead of the normal [[food vs. fuel]] debate. As the synfuel would be used on-site, the process would be more efficient and might just provide enough fuel for a new organic-agriculture fusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cosis.net/abstracts/EGU05/11082/EGU05-J-11082-2.pdf|author=P.

==Policy==
[[File:United States farm subsidies (source Congressional Budget Office).svg|thumb|290px|From a [[Congressional Budget Office]] report]]
{{Main|Agricultural policy}}
[[Agricultural policy]] is the set of government decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products. Governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets. Some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment (including policies related to climate change, [[food safety]] and natural disasters), [[economic stability]] (including policies related to taxes), natural resources and [[environmental sustainability]] (especially [[water resource management|water policy]]), research and development, and market access for domestic commodities (including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page=13|title=Agricultural and food policy choices in Australia|journal=Sustainable agriculture and food policy in the 21st century: challenges and solutions|publisher=Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics – Bureau of Rural Sciences|date=October 2010|accessdate=22 April 2013|author=Lindsay Hogan and Paul Morris|url=http://adl.brs.gov.au/data/warehouse/pe_abarebrs99001749/CP10.15_Agric_food_policy_CONFERENCE_PAPER.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural policy can also touch on [[food quality]], ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality, [[food security]], ensuring that the food supply meets the population's needs, and [[Conservation biology|conservation]]. Policy programs can range from financial programs, such as subsidies, to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/pol/agr/|title=Agriculture: Not Just Farming&amp;nbsp;... |publisher=European Union|accessdate=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many influences on the creation of agricultural policy, including consumers, agribusiness, trade lobbies and other groups. [[Agribusiness]] interests hold a large amount of influence over policy making, in the form of [[lobbying]] and [[campaign contribution]]s. Political action groups, including those interested in environmental issues and [[labor union]]s, also provide influence, as do lobbying organizations representing individual agricultural commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://web.missouri.edu/ikerdj/papers/SFT-Corporatization%20of%20Fm%20Pol%20%289-10%29.htm|title=Corporatization of Agricultural Policy|author=Ikerd, John|journal=Small Farm Today Magazine|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a forum for the negotiation of global agricultural regulations and agreements. Dr. Samuel Jutzi, director of FAO's animal production and health division, states that lobbying by large corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment. For example, proposals in 2010 for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health, and environmental regulations, such as the number of animals an area of land can support without long-term damage, were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/sep/22/food-firms-lobbying-samuel-jutzi |title=Corporate Lobbying Is Blocking Food Reforms, Senior UN Official Warns: Farming Summit Told of Delaying Tactics by Large Agribusiness and Food Producers on Decisions that Would Improve Human Health and the Environment |location=London |first=Juliette |last=Jowit |date= 22 September 2010 |newspaper= The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
