When the [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[explorer]]s arrived in the 15th century, the [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|native tribes of current-day Brazil]], totaling about 2.5 million people, had lived virtually unchanged since the [[Stone Age]]. From [[Portugal]]'s colonization of [[Brazil]] (1500-1822) until the late 1930s, the market elements of the Brazilian economy relied on the production of [[primary products]] for [[export]]s. Within the [[Portuguese Empire]], Brazil was a colony subjected to an imperial [[mercantile]] policy, which had three main large-scale economic production cycles - [[sugar]], [[gold]] and, from the early 19th century on, [[coffee]]. The economy of Brazil was heavily dependent on African enslaved labour until the late 19th century (about 3 million imported African enslaved individuals in total). In that period Brazil was also the colony with the largest amount of European settlers (most of them being ethnic Portuguese, but also Dutch (see [[Dutch Brazil]]) and some Azoreans, Madeirans, Spaniards, English, French, Germans, Flemish, Danish, Scottish refugees and sephardic [[Brazilian Jews|Jews]]). Since then, Brazil experienced a period of strong economic and demographic growth accompanied by mass immigration from [[Europe]] (mainly from [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portugal]], [[Italian Brazilian|Italy]], the [[Portuguese Brazilian|Azores]], [[Spanish Brazilian|Spain]], [[German Brazilian|Germany]], [[Polish Brazilian|Poland]], [[Ukrainian Brazilian|Ukraine]], [[Swiss Brazilian|Switzerland]], [[Portuguese Brazilian|Madeira]], [[Austrian Brazilian|Austria]] and [[Russia|Russian]]. But also from the [[Dutch Brazilian|Netherlands]], [[French Brazilian|France]], [[Finnish Brazilian|Finland]], [[Icelandic Brazilian|Iceland]] and the [[Scandinavian Brazilian|Scandinavian]] countries, [[Lithuanians in Brazil|Lithuania]], [[Belgian Brazilian|Belgium]], [[Bulgarian Brazilian|Bulgaria]], [[Hungarian Brazilian|Hungary]], [[Greek Brazilian|Greece]], [[Latvian Brazilian|Latvia]], [[English Brazilian|England]], [[Irish Brazilian|Ireland]], [[Scottish Brazilian|Scotland]], [[Croat Brazilian|Croatia]], [[Czech Brazilian|Czech Republic]], [[Maltese Brazilian|Malta]], [[Macedonians in Brazil|Macedonia]] and [[Luxembourg Brazilian|Luxembourg]]), the [[Arab Brazilian|Middle East]] (mainly from [[Lebanese Brazilian|Lebanon]], [[Syrian Brazilian|Syria]] and [[Armenian Brazilian|Armenia]]), [[Japan]], smaller amounts from the [[Confederados|United States]] and some [[Afrikaners]] from South Africa) until the 1930s. In the New World, the United States, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Australia, Uruguay, New Zealand, Chile, Mexico, Cuba, Venezuela, Paraguay, Puerto Rico and Peru (in descending order) were the countries that received most immigrants. In Brazil's case, statistics show that 4.5 million people emigrated to the country between 1882 and 1934.

Currently, with a population of over 190 million and abundant [[natural resources]], Brazil is one of the ten largest markets in the world, producing tens of millions of tons of steel, 26 million tons of cement, 3.5 million television sets, and 3 million refrigerators. In addition, about 70 million cubic meters of [[petroleum]] were being processed annually into fuels, lubricants, propane gas, and a wide range of hundred petrochemicals. Furthermore, Brazil has at least 161,500 kilometers of paved roads and more than 93 Gigawatts of installed electric power capacity.

Its real per capita GDP has surpassed [[United States dollar|US$]] 10,500 in 2008, due to the strong and continued appreciation of the [[Brazilian real|real]] for the first time this decade. Its industrial sector accounts for three fifths of the [[Latin America]]n economy's industrial production.&lt;ref name=&quot;BG&quot;/&gt; The country’s [[Brazilian science and technology|scientific and technological]] development is argued to be attractive to [[foreign direct investment]], which has averaged US$30 billion per year the last years, compared to only US$2 billion per year last decade,&lt;ref name=&quot;BG&quot;&gt;[http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/ About Brazil] Brazilian Government.

The agricultural sector, locally called the ''agronegócio'' (agrobusiness), has also been remarkably dynamic: for two decades this sector has kept Brazil amongst the most highly productive countries in areas related to the rural sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;BG&quot;/&gt; The agricultural sector and the mining sector also supported trade surpluses which allowed for massive currency gains (rebound) and external debt paydown.

Data from the [[Asian Development Bank]] and the [[Tax Justice Network]] show the untaxed &quot;shadow&quot; economy of GDP for Brazil is 39%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-05/the-secret-strength-of-pakistans-economy The Secret Strength of Pakistan's Economy - Businessweek&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 67.0 percent, followed by the industrial sector at 27.5 percent. Agriculture represents 5.5 percent of GDP (2011).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worlddiplomacy.org/Countries/Brazil/InfoBra.html&lt;/ref&gt; Brazilian labor force is estimated at 100.77 million of which 10 percent is occupied in agriculture, 19 percent in the industry sector and 71 percent in the service sector.

{{Main|Agriculture in Brazil}}
A performance that puts agribusiness in a position of distinction in terms of [[Brazil|Brazil’s]] [[trade balance]], in spite of trade barriers and subsidizing policies adopted by the developed countries.&lt;ref name = &quot;BGA&quot;/&gt;

In the space of fifty five years (1950 to 2005), the population of Brazil grew from 51 million to approximately 187 million inhabitants,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibge.gov.br/english/disseminacao/online/popclock/popclock.php Popclock] IBGE&lt;/ref&gt; an increase of over 2 percent per year. In order to meet this demand, it was necessary to take the development of cattle and crop raising activities a step further. Since then, an authentic green revolution has taken place, allowing the country to create and expand a complex [[agribusiness]] sector.&lt;ref name = &quot;BGA&quot;/&gt; However, some of this is at the expense of the environment, including the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]].

The importance given to the rural producer takes place in the shape of the agricultural and [[cattle]]-raising plan and through another specific program geared towards family [[agriculture]] (Pronaf), which guarantee financing for equipment and cultivation and encourage the use of new [[technology]], as shown by the use of agricultural land zoning. With regards to family agriculture, over 800 thousand rural inhabitants are assisted by credit, research and extension programs. The special line of credit for women and young farmers is an innovation worth mentioning, providing an incentive towards the entrepreneurial spirit.&lt;ref name = &quot;BGA&quot;/&gt;

With The Land Reform Program, on the other hand, the country's objective is to provide suitable living and working conditions for over one million families who live in areas allotted by the State, an initiative capable of generating two million [[Employment|jobs]]. Through partnerships, public policies and international partnerships, the government is working towards the guarantee of an infrastructure for the settlements, following the examples of [[school]]s and health outlets. The idea is that access to land represents just the first step towards the implementation of a quality land reform program.&lt;ref name = &quot;BGA&quot;/&gt;

Over 600,000&amp;nbsp;km² of land are divided into approximately five thousand areas of rural [[property]]; an agricultural area currently with three borders: the [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-western region]] (savanna), the [[North Region, Brazil|Northern region]] (area of transition) and parts of the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern region]] (semi-arid). At the forefront of grain crops, which produce over 110 million tonnes/year, is the soybean, yielding 50 million tonnes.&lt;ref name = &quot;BGA&quot;/&gt;

In the [[bovine]] cattle-raising sector, the &quot;green ox,&quot; which is raised in pastures, on a [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] of hay and [[mineral]] salts, conquered markets in [[Asia]], [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]], particularly after the &quot;mad [[cow]] disease&quot; scare period.

A pioneer and leader in the manufacture of short-fiber timber [[cellulose]], Brazil has also achieved positive results within the [[packaging]] sector, in which it is the fifth largest world producer. In the foreign markets, it answers for 25 percent of global exports of raw cane and refined sugar; it is the world leader in [[soybean]] exports and is responsible for 80 percent of the planet's orange juice, and since 2003, has had the highest sales figures for [[beef]] and [[chicken]], among the countries that deal in this sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;BGA&quot;&gt;[http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/brasil_topics/ Agriculture] Brazilian Government.

{{Main|Industry in Brazil}}
[[Brazil]] has the second biggest industrial sector in the [[Americas]]. Accounting for 28.5 percent of [[gross domestic product|GDP]], Brazil's diverse industries range from [[automobile]]s, [[steel]] and [[petrochemical]]s to [[computer]]s, [[aircraft]], and [[consumer durable]]s. With increased economic stability provided by the [[Plano Real]], Brazilian and multinational businesses have invested heavily in new equipment and technology, a large proportion of which has been purchased from U.S. firms.

Brazil has a diverse and sophisticated services industry as well. During the early 1990s, the banking sector accounted for as much as 16 percent of the GDP. Although undergoing a major overhaul, Brazil's financial services industry provides local [[business]]es with a wide range of products and is attracting numerous new entrants, including U.S. financial firms. On May 8, 2008, the São Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa) and the São Paulo-based Brazilian Mercantile and Futures Exchange (BM&amp;F) merged, creating BM&amp;FBOVESPA, one of the largest stock exchanges in the world. Also, the previously monopolistic reinsurance sector is being opened up to third party companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/dinheiro/ult91u113719.shtml|title=Government breaks reinsurance monopoly, discards privatization (in Portuguese)|accessdate=2008-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2005|alt=As of}} 31 December 2007, there were an estimated 21,304,000 broadband lines in Brazil. Over 75 percent of the broadband lines were via [[digital subscriber line|DSL]] and 10 percent via cable modems.

Proven [[mineral resources]] are extensive. Large iron and manganese reserves are important sources of industrial raw materials and export earnings. Deposits of nickel, tin, chromite, uranium, bauxite, beryllium, copper, lead, tungsten, zinc, gold, and other minerals are exploited. High-quality cooking-grade coal required in the steel industry is in short supply.

===Energy===
{{Main|Energy policy of Brazil|Renewable energy in Brazil}}
The Brazilian government has undertaken an ambitious program to reduce dependence on imported [[petroleum]]. Imports previously accounted for more than 70% of the country's oil needs but Brazil became self-sufficient in oil in 2006-2007. Brazil is one of the world's leading producers of [[hydroelectric power]], with a current capacity of about 260,000 megawatts. Existing [[hydroelectric power]] provides 90 percent of the nation's electricity. Two large hydroelectric projects, the 19,900 megawatt [[Itaipu Dam]] on the [[Paraná River]] (the world's largest dam) and the Tucurui Dam in [[Pará]] in [[North Region, Brazil|northern Brazil]], are in operation. Brazil's first commercial [[nuclear reactor]], [[Angra I]], located near [[Rio de Janeiro]], has been in operation for more than 10 years. [[Angra II]] was completed in 2002 and is in operation too. An [[Angra III]] has its planned inauguration scheduled for 2014. The three reactors would have combined capacity of 9,000 megawatts when completed. The government also plans to build 19 more nuclear plants by the year 2020.

=== Sustainable growth ===
[[File:Stacked-Export Destinations of Brazil.png|thumbnail|left|Export Destinations of Brazil from 2000 to 2012&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dataviva.info/apps/builder/stacked/secex/all/all/all/wld/?controls=true&amp;value_var=val_usd&amp;sort=name&amp;depth=wld_2&amp;layout=value&amp;order=asc Stacked: Export Destinations of Brazil.] [[DataViva]]. Retrieved on 01/09/14.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

After the arrival of the Portuguese explorers in 1500, it was only in 1808 that [[Brazil]] obtained a permit from the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese colonial government]] to set up its first factories and manufacturers. In the 21st century, Brazil reached the status of 8th largest economy in the world. Originally, the export list was basic raw and primary goods, such as sugar, rubber and gold. Today, 84 percent of exports consists of manufactured and semi-manufactured products.

The period of great economic transformation and growth occurred between 1875 and 1975.

In the last [[decade]], domestic production increased by 32.3 percent and [[agribusiness]] (agriculture and cattle-raising), which grew by 47 percent or 3.6 percent per year, was the most dynamic sector – even after having weathered international crises that demanded constant adjustments to the Brazilian economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/brasil_topics/economy/categoria_view Sustainable growth] Brazilian Government. Retrieved on 2011-10-24.&lt;/ref&gt; The Brazilian government also launched a program for economic development acceleration called [[Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento]], aiming to spur growth.

Brazil's transparency ranking status in the international world is 75th according to [[Transparency International]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2009/cpi_2009_table Transparency by country 2009] [[Transparency International]]. Retrieved on 2011-10-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Control and reform ===
Among measures recently adopted in order to [[Balance (accounting)|balance]] the economy, Brazil carried out reforms to its [[Social security]] (state and retirement pensions) and Tax systems. These changes brought with them a noteworthy addition: a Law of Fiscal Responsibility which controls public expenditure by the Executive Branches at [[Federal republic|federal]], [[State (administrative division)|state]] and [[municipal]] levels. At the same time, investments were made towards administration efficiency and policies were created to encourage [[export]]s, [[industry]] and [[trade]], thus creating &quot;windows of opportunity&quot; for local and international investors and producers.

With these alterations in place, Brazil has reduced its vulnerability: it doesn't import the oil it consumes; it has halved its domestic [[debt]] through exchange rate-linked certificates and has seen exports grow, on average, by 20% a year. The exchange rate does not put pressure on the industrial sector or [[inflation]] (at 4% a year), and does away with the possibility of a [[liquidity crisis]]. As a result, the country, after 12 years, has achieved a positive balance in the accounts which measure exports/imports, plus interest payments, services and overseas payment. Thus, respected economists say that the country won't be deeply affected by the current world economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/brasil_topics/economy/categoria_view Control and reform] Brazilian Government. Retrieved on 2011-10-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CentroRJ.jpg|thumb|right|Central Business District of [[Rio de Janeiro]].]]
=== Consistent policies ===
Support for the productive sector has been simplified at all levels; active and independent, [[National Congress of Brazil|Congress]] and the Judiciary Branch carry out the evaluation of rules and regulations. Among the main measures taken to stimulate the economy are the reduction of up to 30 percent on [[Manufactured]] Products Tax (IPI), and the investment of $8 billion on road cargo transportation fleets, thus improving distribution logistics. Further resources guarantee the propagation of business and information telecenters.

The Policy for [[Industry]], [[Technology]] and [[Foreign Trade]], at the forefront of this sector, for its part, invests $19.5 billion in specific sectors, following the example of the software and semiconductor, pharmaceutical and medicine product, and capital goods sectors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brasil.gov.br/ingles/about_brazil/brasil_topics/economy/categoria_view Consistent policies] Brazilian Government.

=== Mergers &amp; acquisitions ===
[[File:Boa Viagem Beach - Recife - Pernambuco - Brazil.jpg|thumb|right|View of [[Recife]].]]
Between 1993 and 2010, 7.012 [[Mergers and acquisitions|mergers &amp; acquisitions]] with a total known value of $707 billion USD with the involvement of Brazilian firms have been announced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imaa-institute.org/statistics-mergers-acquisitions.html#MergersAcquisitions_Brazil Mergers and Acquisitions: Brazil] Institute of Mergers, Acquisitions and Alliances. Retrieved on 2011-10-24.&lt;/ref&gt; The year 2010 was a new record in terms of value with $115 billion of transactions. The largest transaction with involvement of Brazilian companies has been: [[Vale (mining company)|Cia Vale do Rio Doce]] acquired [[Vale Inco|Inco]] in a tender offer valued at $18.9 billions.

=== Entrepreneurship ===
According to a search of [[Global Entrepreneurship Monitor]] in 2011 Brazil had 27 million adults aged between 18 and 64 either starting or owning a business, meaning that more than one in four Brazilian adults were entrepreneurs. In comparison to the other 54 countries studied, Brazil was the third-highest in absolute number of entrepreneurs. Ipea, a government agency, found that 37 million jobs in Brazil were associated with businesses with up to 10 employees.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.grupomaquina.com/maquinaNet/techEngine?sid=MaquinaNet&amp;command=noticiaClippingSite&amp;action=visualizar&amp;idNoticia=2368106366895 A spirit for entreprise, Finantial Times Online, May 8th,2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent research of Global Entrepreneurship Monitor revealed in 2013 that 50.4% of Brazilian new entrepreneurs are men, 33.8% are in the 35-44 age group, 36.9% completed high school and 47.9% earn 3-6 times the Brazilian minimum wage. In contrast, 49.6% of entrepreneurs are female, only 7% are in the 55–64 age group, 1% have postgraduate education and 1.7% earn more than 9 times the minimum wage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gemconsortium.org/docs/2645/gem-2012-global-report GEM 2012 Global Report&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Credit rating ===
Brazil's credit rating was downgraded by Standard &amp; Poor's to BBB in March 2014, just one notch above junk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-27/rousseff-losing-bond-investors-as-downgrade-to-junk-looms.html Rousseff Losing Bond Investors as Downgrade to Junk Looms - Bloomberg] Bloomberg&lt;/ref&gt;
