'''Baku''' ({{lang-az|Bakı}}, {{IPA-tr|bɑˈcɯ|IPA}}) is the capital and largest city of [[Azerbaijan]], as well as the largest city on the [[Caspian Sea]] and of the [[Caucasus]] region. Baku is located {{convert|28|m|ft}} below [[sea level]], which makes it the lowest lying national capital in the world and also the largest city in the world located below sea level. It is located on the southern shore of the [[Absheron Peninsula]], which projects into the [[Caspian Sea]]. The city consists of two principal parts: the downtown area and the old [[Old City (Baku)|Inner City]] (21.5 [[hectare|ha]]). At the beginning of 2009, Baku's [[urban population]] was estimated at just over two million people.&lt;ref name=&quot;pop&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Baku is divided into [[Baku#Governance|eleven administrative districts]] (raions) and 48 townships. Among these are the townships on islands in the [[Bay of Baku|Baku Bay]] and the town of [[Oil Rocks]] built on stilts in the [[Caspian Sea]], {{convert|60|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} away from Baku. The Inner City of Baku along with the [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs|Shirvanshah's Palace]] and [[Maiden Tower (Baku)|Maiden Tower]] were inscribed as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in 2000. According to the [[Lonely Planet]]'s ranking, Baku is also among the world's top ten destinations for urban nightlife.&lt;ref name=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;{{cite news

The city is the scientific, cultural and industrial center of Azerbaijan.

It hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|57th Eurovision Song Contest]] in 2012 and will host the [[2015 European Games]], 2016 [[European Grand Prix]] and [[Euro 2020]].

The city is renowned for its harsh winds. This is reflected in the city's nickname, the &quot;[[City of Winds]]&quot;.

==Etymology==
Various different hypotheses have been also proposed to explain the etymology of the word ''Baku'' to suit a given political agenda . According to L.G.Lopatinski&lt;ref&gt;Ган К.Ф. Oпыть объяснения кавказских географических названий. Тифлис, 1909&lt;/ref&gt; and Ali Huseynzade,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;.[http://window2baku.com/eng/9002toponimbaku.htm The Name “Baku”]&lt;/ref&gt; for example, ''Baku'' is derived from [[Turkic language|Turkic]] word for &quot;hill&quot;. Caucasian history specialist [[Kerope Patkanov]] also explains the name as &quot;hill&quot; but in the [[Lak language]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; The Turkish ''Islamic Encyclopedia'' presents the origin of the word ''Baku'' as being derived from the words ''Bey-Kyoy'', which mean &quot;the main city&quot; in Turkic. Another theory suggests that the name Baku is derived from the ancient [[Caucasian Albania]]n city which was called Baguan.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} A less probable [[folk etymology]] explains the name as deriving from ''Baghkuy'', meaning &quot;God's town&quot;. ''Baga'' (now ''بغ'' ''bagh'') and ''kuy'' are the [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] words for &quot;god&quot; and &quot;town&quot; respectively; the name ''Baghkuy'' may be compared with ''[[Baghdad|Baghdād]]'' (&quot;God-given&quot;) in which ''dād'' is the Old Persian word for &quot;give&quot;. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] sources refer to the city as ''Baku'', ''Bakukh'', ''Bakuya'', and ''Bakuye'', all of which seem to come from a Persian name.

==History==
{{Main|History of Baku}}

===Antiquity===
[[File:Qobustan inscription.jpg|thumb|Roman stone inscription in [[Gobustan National Park|Gobustan]] dating back to 84-96 A.D.]]
Around 100,000 years ago, the territory of modern Baku and [[Absheron Rayon|Absheron]] was savanna with rich flora and fauna. Traces of human settlement go back to the [[Stone age]]. From the [[Bronze age]] there have been rock carvings discovered near Bayil, and a bronze figure of a small fish discovered in the territory of the Old City. This have led some to suggest the existence of a Bronze Age settlement within the city's territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://azerisite.narod.ru/2.html Город Баку...] Retrieved on 24 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Near [[Nardaran]], in a place called Umid Gaya, a prehistoric observatory was discovered, where on the rock the images of sun and various constellations are carved together with a primitive astronomic table.&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Observatory of Absheron. ''Gobustan'', No 3 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; Further archeological excavations revealed various prehistoric settlements, native temples, statues and other artifacts within the territory of the modern city and around it.

In the 1st century, [[Roman Empire|Romans]] organized two Caucasian campaigns and reached Baku. Near the city, in [[Gobustan National Park|Gobustan]], Roman inscriptions dating from 84–96&amp;nbsp;AD were discovered. This is one of the earliest written evidences for Baku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldheritage.heindorffhus.dk/frame-AzerbaijanBaku.htm|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20080102011734/http://worldheritage.heindorffhus.dk/frame-AzerbaijanBaku.htm|archivedate=2 January 2008 |title=Azerbaijan – Walled City of Baku with the Shirvanshah's Palace...|accessdate=14 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise of the Shirvanshahs and the Safavid era===
{{See also|Shirvanshah}}
[[File:1541-Battle in the war between Shah Isma'il and the King of Shirvan-Shahnama-i-Isma'il.jpg|upright|thumb|A [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature painting]] marking the downfall of the Shirvanshahs at the hands of the Safavids.]]
During the 8th century Baku was the realm of the [[Shirvanshahs]]. The city frequently came under assault of the [[Khazars]] and (starting from the 10th century) the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]]. [[Akhsitan I ibn Minuchihr III|Shirvanshah Akhsitan I]] built a navy in Baku and successfully repelled another Rus assault in 1170. After a devastating earthquake struck [[Shamakhy]], the capital of [[Shirvan]], Shirvanshah’s court moved to Baku in 1191.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaspiy.az/rubrics.php?code=316 &quot;Ичери Шехер&quot;: быть или не быть] Retrieved on 25 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sabayil relics.jpg|thumb|Relics from the sunken [[Sabayil Castle]].]]
The Shirvan era greatly influence Baku and the remainder of Azerbaijan. Between the 12th and 14th centuries, massive fortifications were undertaken in Baku and the surrounding towns. The [[Maiden Tower (Baku)|Maiden Tower]], the [[Ramana Tower]], the [[Nardaran Fortress]], the Shagan Castle, the [[Quadrangular castle (Mardakan)|Mardakan Castle]], the [[Round Castle (Mardakan)|Round Castle]] and also the famous [[Sabayil Castle]] on the island of the [[Bay of Baku]] was built during this period. The [[Old City (Baku)|city walls of Baku]] were also rebuilt and strengthened.

By the early 16th century Baku's wealth and strategic position attracted the focus of its larger neighbors, and had already been ruled in the previous two centuries by the in Persia centred [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Ak Koyunlu]]. The fall of the Ak Koyunlu brought the city immediately into the sphere of the newly formed [[Safavid dynasty]], who, led by [[Ismail I|Shah Ismail I]] laid siege to Baku in 1501 and captured it making it an integral part of his empire for the next centuries to come. The House of Shirvan, who ruled Baku since the 9th century, was extinguished.

At this time the city was enclosed within the lines of strong walls, which were washed by the sea on one side and protected by a wide trench on land. In 1540 Baku was again captured by the Safavid troops following an occupation by the Ottomans as a result of the [[Battle of Chaldiran]]. In 1578 the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] captured Baku and held it till 1603, when it was again put under Persian control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=3SapTk5iGDkC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=ottoman+empire+captured+baku&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8s-Ic6Pf7p&amp;sig=nOe15LuG88LoalmhJBRjKX2xtGo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ekyWUsvNHsbMkQez8YH4AQ&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=ottoman%20empire%20captured%20baku&amp;f=false Cities of the Middle East and North Africa: A Historical Encyclopedia - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1604 the Baku fortress was destroyed by Shah [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]].

===Downfall of the Safavids and the Khanate of Baku===
The fall of the Iranian Safavids gave rise to the various [[Khanates of the Caucasus|Azerbaijani khanates]], who most of them were already established in the late Safavid era while the rest of them were established during the rule of Iranian ruler [[Nader Shah]]. After the death of Nader Shah in 1747, the semi-independent principality of [[Baku Khanate]] was formed. It was ruled by Mirza Muhammed Khan but soon became a dependency of the much stronger [[Quba Khanate]]. During the time, the population of Baku was small (approximately 5,000), and the economy was ruined as a result of constant warfare.

===Russo-Persian Wars and Persia's forced ceding===
[[File:Баку. Набережная. 1861.jpg|left|thumb|Painting of Baku's shoreline in 1861 by [[Alexey Bogolyubov]].]]
On 26 June 1723, [[Russo-Persian War (1722–23)|after a long siege]], Baku surrendered to the Russians and the Safavids were forced to cede the city alongside many other of their Caucasian territories. By 1730, the situation had deteriorated for the Russians as [[Nader Shah|Nadir Shah's]] successes in Shirvan forced the Russians to make an agreement near [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] on 10 March 1735, ceding the city and all other conquered territories in the Caucasus back to Persia.

By the end of the 18th century, [[Tsar]]ist Russia now began a more firm policy with the intent to conquer all of the Caucasus at the expense of especially Persia and to a lesser extent Ottoman Turkey. In the spring of 1796, by [[Yekaterina II]]’s order, General [[Valerian Zubov]]’s troops started a large campaign in the North Caucasus and Transcaucasia against [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] Persia following the [[Battle of Krtsanisi|sack of Tblisi]] and Persia's subsequent restoring of its suzerainty over Georgia and [[Dagestan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.academia.edu/9137125/Relations_between_Tehran_and_Moscow_1979-2014|title=Relations between Tehran and Moscow, 1797-2014|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ijbssnet.com/journals/Vol_3_No_12_Special_Issue_June_2012/18.pdf|title=The Qajar Dynasty in Iran: The Most Important Occurence Evented in the Qajars Monarchy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zubov had sent 13,000 men to capture Baku, and it was overrun subsequently without any resistance. On 13 June 1796, a Russian flotilla entered Baku Bay, and a garrison of Russian troops was placed inside the city. Later, however, [[Paul I of Russia|Pavel I]] ordered the cessation of the campaign and the withdrawal of Russian forces following his predecessor, [[Catherine the Great]] her death. In March 1797, the tsarist troops left Baku.

In 1813, following the [[Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)]], Russia signed the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] with Persia, which provided for the forced cession of Baku and most of its territories in the [[North Caucasus]] and [[South Caucasus]] from Persia to Russia. However it was not until the aftermatch of the [[Russo-Persian War (1826-1828)]] and the [[Treaty of Gulistan]] that Baku came under nominal Russian rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mojtahed-Zadeh, Pirouz|year=2007|title=Boundary Politics and International Boundaries of Iran: A Study of the Origin, Evolution, and Implications of the Boundaries of Modern Iran with Its 15 Neighbors in the Middle East by a Number of Renowned Experts in the Field|publisher=Universal|isbn=1-58112-933-5|page=372}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
When Baku was occupied by the Russian troops during the war of 1804-1813, nearly the entire population of some 8,000 people was ethnic [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.nl&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=oZCOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=azeris+flee+to+iran+russo+persian+wars&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GYOZVLaEG4vvUuyqgaAL&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=azeris%20flee%20to%20iran%20russo%20persian%20wars&amp;f=false|title=Ethnic Groups of North, East, and Central Asia: An Encyclopedia|accessdate=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery of oil===
{{main|Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan}}
[[File:BibiEybat.jpg|thumb|Oil workers, known as 'Neftchiler', digging an oil well by hand at Bibi-Heybat.]]
The first [[oil well]] was mechanically drilled in the [[Bibi-Heybat Mosque|Bibi-Heybat]] suburb of Baku in 1846, though a number of hand-dug wells predate it. Large-scale oil exploration started in 1872, when Russian imperial authorities auctioned the parcels of oil-rich land around Baku to private investors. Within a short period of time Swiss, British, French, Belgian, German, Swedish and American investors appeared in Baku. Among them were the firms of the [[Robert Nobel|Nobel brothers]] together with the family [[Schuch|von Börtzell-Szuch]] (Carl Knut Börtzell, who also owned the [[Livadia Palace]]) and the [[Rothschild family]]. An industrial oil belt, better known as Black City, was established near Baku.

Professor A. V. Williams Jackson of Columbia University wrote in his work ''From Constantinople to the Home of Omar Khayyam'' (1911):
{{quotation|Baku is a city founded upon oil, for to its inexhaustible founts of naphtha it owes its very existence, its maintenance, its prosperity.... At present Baku produces one-fifth of the oil that is used in the world, and the immense output in crude petroleum from this single city far surpasses that in any other district where oil is found. Verily, the words of the Scriptures find illustration here: 'the rock poured me out rivers of oil.

Oil is in the air one breathes, in one's nostrils, in one's eyes, in the water of the morning bath (though not in the drinking water, for that is brought in bottles from distant mineral springs), in one's starched linen – everywhere. This is the impression one carries away from Baku, and it is certainly true in the environs.''&lt;ref&gt;Abraham Valentine Williams Jackson. {{cite web|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/fromconstantino00jackgoog#page/n10/mode/2up|title=From Constantinople to the Home of Omar Khayyam|publisher=The Macmillan Company, 1911, p. 25|accessdate=1 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By the beginning of the 20th century almost half of world production was being extracted in Baku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.window2baku.com/eng/9001history_3.htm |title=Window2Baku.com |publisher=Window2Baku.com |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oil boom contributed to the massive growth of Baku. Between 1856 and 1910 Baku's population grew at a faster rate than that of [[London]], [[Paris]] or [[New York]].

===World War I===
[[File:Army of Azerbaijan in 1918.jpg|thumb|Soldiers and officers of the army of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic shortly after the [[Battle of Baku]].]]
[[File:Neftchiler Avenue 1918-1920.jpg|thumb|[[Neftchiler Avenue]] in Baku, circa 1920.]]
In 1917, after the [[October Revolution|October revolution]] and amidst the turmoil of [[World War I]] and the [[Russian revolution|breakup of the Russian Empire]], Baku came under the control of the [[26 Baku Commissars|Baku Commune]], which was led by veteran Bolshevik [[Stepan Shahumyan|Stepan Shaumyan]]. Seeking to capitalize on the existing inter-ethnic conflicts, by spring 1918, Bolsheviks inspired and condoned civil warfare in and around Baku. During the infamous [[March Days]], Bolsheviks and [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnaks]] seeking to establish control over the Baku streets, were faced with armed Azerbaijani groups. The Azerbaijanis suffered a crushing defeat by the united forces of the Baku Soviet and were massacred by Dashnak teams. An estimated 12.000 Azerbaijanis were killed in their own capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;smithmusavat&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=Michael |last2= |first2= |date=April 2001 |title=Anatomy of Rumor: Murder Scandal, the Musavat Party and Narrative of the Russian Revolution in Baku, 1917-1920 |journal=Journal of Contemporary History |publisher= |volume=36 |issue=2 |page=228 |url= |doi= 10.1177/002200940103600202|quote=''The results of the March events were immediate and total for the Musavat.

Russia and Azerbaijan: A Borderland in Transition. Columbia University Press, 1995. ISBN 0-231-07068-3, ISBN 978-0-231-07068-3 and Reinhard Schulze. A Modern History of the Islamic World. I.B.Tauris, 2000. ISBN 1-86064-822-3, ISBN 978-1-86064-822-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The newly independent Azerbaijani republic, being unable to defend the independence of the country on their own, asked the Ottoman Empire for military support in accordance with clause 4 of the treaty between the two countries. Shortly after, Azerbaijani forces, with support of the [[Ottoman Army of Islam]] led by [[Nuri Killigil|Nuru Pasha]], started their advance into Baku, eventually capturing the city from the loose coalition of [[Bolshevik]]s, [[Socialist-Revolutionary Party|Esers]], [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnaks]], [[Menshevik]]s and British forces under the command of General [[Lionel Dunsterville]] on 15 September 1918.

After the [[Battle of Baku]], the Azerbaijani irregular troops, with the tacit support of the Turkish command, conducted four days of pillaging and killing of the Armenian residents of Baku. This pogrom, known as the [[September Days]] was the retaliation for the previous pogrom of Azerbaijanis, known as the [[March Days]]. Shortly after this Baku was proclaimed the new capital of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.

===Soviet conquest===
The independence of the Azerbaijani republic was a significant but a short lived chapter. On 28 April 1920, the [[11th Army (Soviet Union)|11th Red Army]] invaded Baku and reinstalled the Bolsheviks, making Baku the capital of the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]].

The city underwent many major changes. As a result, Baku played a great role in many branches of the Soviet life. Since about 1921, the city was headed by the Baku City Executive Committee, commonly known in Russian as ''Bakgorispolkom''. Together with the Baku Party Committee (known as the ''Baksovet''), it developed the economic significance of the Caspian metropolis. From 1922 to 1930, Baku was the venue for one of the major [[Trade fair]]s of the Soviet Union, serving as a commercial bridgehead to Iran and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Etienne Forestier-Peyrat, ″[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/ab_imperio/summary/v2013/2013.4.forestier-peyrat.html Red Passage to Iran: The Baku Trade Fair and the Unmaking of the Azerbaijani Borderland, 1922-1930]″, ''Ab Imperio'', Vol 2013, Issue 4, pp. 79-112.&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
Baku's growing importance as a major energy hub remained in sight of the major powers. During [[World War II]] and the [[Case Blue|Nazi German invasion of the southwestern Soviet Union]], Baku had become of vital strategic importance. In fact, capturing the [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan#World War II|oil fields of Baku]] was one of the ultimate goals of [[Operation Edelweiss]], carried out between May and November 1942. However the German Army's closest approach to Baku was no closer than some {{convert|530|km|0|abbr=off}} northwest of Baku in November 1942, falling far short of the city's capture before being driven back during the Soviet [[Operation Little Saturn]] in mid-December 1942.

===Fall of the Soviet Union===
After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Baku embarked on a process of restructuring on a scale unseen in its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Money from oil changes the face of Azerbaijan|url=http://news.az/articles/society/41029|publisher=news.az|accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of buildings from the Soviet period were demolished to make way for a green belt on its shores; parks and gardens were built on the land reclaimed by filling up the beaches of the [[Baku Bay]]. Improvements were made in the general cleaning, maintenance, and garbage collection, and these services are now at Western European standards. The city is growing dynamically and developing at full speed on an east-west axis along the shores of the [[Caspian Sea]].

==Geography==
[[File:Baku, Azerbaijan, satellite image, LandSat-5, 2010-09-06.jpg|thumb|Greater Baku satellite image, [[Landsat 5]], 6 September 2010]]
Baku is situated on the western coast of [[Caspian Sea]]. In the vicinity of the city there are a number of [[mud volcano]]es (Keyraki, Bogkh-bogkha, [[Lokbatan]] and others) and [[salt lake]]s ([[Lake Boyukshor|Boyukshor]], Khodasan and so on).

===Climate===
Baku has a [[subtropical]] [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''BSk'') with warm and dry summers, cool and occasionally wet winters, and strong winds all year long. However, unlike many other cities with this climate, Baku does not see extremely hot summers. This is largely because of its northerly [[latitude]] and the fact that it is located on a peninsula on the shore of the Caspian Sea.
Baku and the [[Absheron Peninsula]] on which it is situated, is the most arid part of Azerbaijan ([[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] here is around or less than {{convert|200|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} a year). The majority of the light annual precipitation occurs in seasons other than summer, but none of these months are particularly wet.
During Soviet times, Baku with its long hours of sunshine and dry healthy climate, was a vacation destination where citizens could enjoy beaches or relax in now-dilapidated [[destination spa|spa]] complexes overlooking the Caspian Sea. The city's past as a Soviet industrial center has left it as one of the most polluted cities in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;ForbesPollution&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2008/02/26/pollution-baku-oil-biz-logistics-cx_tl_0226dirtycities.html |title=The World's Dirtiest Cities |work=Forbes |author=Tiffany M. Luck |date=26 February 2008 |accessdate=17 November 2010| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20101202072636/http://www.forbes.com/2008/02/26/pollution-baku-oil-biz-logistics-cx_tl_0226dirtycities.html| archivedate= 2 December 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time Baku is noted as a very windy city throughout the year, hence the city's nickname the &quot;[[City of Winds]]&quot;, and gale-force winds, the cold northern wind ''[[khazri]]'' and the warm southern wind ''[[gilavar]]'' are typical here in all seasons. Indeed, the city is renowned for its fierce winter snow storms and harsh winds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Web.archive.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iranchamber.com/podium/culture/020920_politicizing_linguistics.php |archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20071013212555/http://iranchamber.com/podium/culture/020920_politicizing_linguistics.php |archivedate=13 October 2007 |title=Culture &amp; Religion on Podium: Politicizing Linguistics |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=25 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The speed of the ''khazri'' sometimes reaches 144 kph (89&amp;nbsp;mph), which can cause damage to crops, trees and roof tiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.global-ict.mincom.gov.az/aboutazerb.php |title=Global ICT Conference: 25–28, November, 2004 : Baku, Azerbaijan |publisher=Global-ict.mincom.gov.az |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The daily mean temperature in July and August averages {{convert|26.4|°C|°F}}, and there is very little rainfall during that season. During summer the ''khazri'' sweeps through, bringing desired coolness. Winter is cool and occasionally wet, with the daily mean temperature in January and February averaging {{convert|4.3|°C|°F}}. During winter the ''khazri'' sweeps through, driven by polar [[air mass]]es; temperatures on the coast frequently drop below freezing and make it feel bitterly cold. Winter [[Winter storm|snow storms]] are occasional; [[snow]] usually melts within a few days after each snowfall.

The average annual temperature in Baku and that of the Earth differ by less than {{convert|0.1|C-change|2|abbr=on}}: it is {{convert|14.2|°C|°F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.window2baku.com/eng/9000capital.htm |title=Window to Baku |publisher=Window2baku.com |accessdate=17 April 2010| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20100510014037/http://www.window2baku.com/eng/9000capital.htm| archivedate= 10 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1988 Baku had very large Russian, Armenian, and Jewish populations which contributed to [[cultural diversity]] and added in various ways (music, literature, architecture and progressive outlook) to Baku's history. With the onset of the [[Karabakh War]] and the [[Pogrom of Armenians in Baku|pogrom against Armenians]] starting in January 1990, the city's large Armenian population was expelled.&lt;ref&gt;Azerbaijan: The status of Armenians, Russians, Jews and other minorities, report, 1993, INS Resource Informacion Center, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-44300/Azerbaijan#481451.hook |title=Azerbaijan – The Soviet and post-Soviet periods |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Under Communism, the Soviets took over the majority of Jewish property in Baku and Kuba. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, [[President of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani President]] [[Heydar Aliyev]] returned several synagogues and a Jewish college, nationalized by the Soviets, to the Jewish community. He encouraged the restoration of these buildings and is well liked by the Jews of Azerbaijan. Renovation has begun on seven of the original 11 synagogues, including the Gilah synagogue, built in 1896, and the large Kruei Synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Azerbaijan.html |title=JewishVirtualLibrary.org |publisher=JewishVirtualLibrary.org |date=10 July 2006 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic groups===
Today the vast majority of the population of Baku are ethnic [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]] (more than 90%). When Baku was occupied by the Russian troops during the [[Russo-Persian War (1804-1813)]], nearly the entire population of some 8,000 people was ethnic [[Tat people (Caucasus)|Tat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.nl&quot;/&gt; The intensive growth of the population started in the middle of the 19th century when Baku was a small town with a population of about 7,000 people. The population increased again from about 13,000 in the 1860s to 112,000 in 1897 and 215,000 in 1913, making Baku the largest city in the Caucasus region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-946.html |title=Country-data.com |publisher=Country-data.com |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baku has been a cosmopolitan city at certain times during its history, meaning ethnic Azerbaijanis did not constitute the majority of population.&lt;ref&gt;Audrey Altstadt, Conflict, Cleavage, and Change in Central Asia and the Caucasus, [[Cambridge University Press]], 1997, p. 112, table 4.1, Ethnic composition of Baku, 1897, 1903,1913&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 Baku additionally had 153,400 [[internally displaced person]]s and 93,400 refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baku-online.com/ru/baku.htm|archiveurl=//web.archive.org/web/20070701132551/http://www.baku-online.com/ru/baku.htm|archivedate=1 July 2007|script-title=ru:Баку|accessdate=15 July 2007|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
[[File:Bibi-Eybat mosque, Baku, 2009.jpg|thumb|The 13th-century [[Bibi-Heybat Mosque]]. The mosque was built over the tomb of a descendant of the Prophet [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bibi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Sharifov|first=Azad|title=Legend of the Bibi-Heybat Mosque|url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/63_folder/63_articles/63_bibiheybat.html|publisher=Azerbaijan International Magazine|accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] Zoroastrianism had a long [[Zoroastrianism in Azerbaijan|history in Azerbaijan]].

The urban landscape of Baku is shaped by many communities. The religion with the largest community of followers is Islam. The majority of the Muslims are [[Shia Islam|Shia Muslims]], and the Republic of Azerbaijan has the second highest Shia population percentage in the world after [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;Juan Eduardo Campo,''Encyclopedia of Islam'', p.625&lt;/ref&gt; The city's notable mosques include [[Juma Mosque (Baku)|Juma Mosque]], [[Bibi-Heybat Mosque]], [[Muhammad Mosque (Baku)|Muhammad Mosque]] and [[Taza Pir Mosque]].

There are some other faiths practiced among the different ethnic groups within the country. By article 48 of its [[Constitution of Azerbaijan|Constitution]], Azerbaijan is a [[secular state]] and ensures religious freedom. Religious minorities include [[Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox Christians]], [[Levant|Catholic Levantines]], [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Georgian Orthodox Christians]], [[Lutherans]], [[Azerbaijani Jews|Ashkenazi]] Jews and [[Sufi]] Muslims.

==Economy==
[[File:Downtown of Baku panoramics.png|thumb|Downtown Baku, with the [[Flame Towers]] in the background.]]

Baku's largest industry is petroleum, and its petroleum exports make it a large contributor to Azerbaijan's [[balance of payments]]. The existence of petroleum has been known since the 8th century. In the 10th century, the Arabian traveler, Marudee, reported that both white and black oil were being extracted naturally from Baku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/22_folder/22_articles/22_historyofoil.html |title=The History of Oil in Azerbaijan by Natig Aliyev |publisher=Azer.com |accessdate=22 May 2009| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20090424163308/http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/22_folder/22_articles/22_historyofoil.html| archivedate= 24 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 15th century, oil for lamps was obtained from hand-dug surface wells.
Commercial exploitation began in 1872, and by the beginning of the 20th century the [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan|Baku oil fields]] were the largest in the world. Towards the end of the 20th century much of the onshore petroleum had been exhausted, and drilling had extended into the sea offshore. By the end of the 19th century [[skilled worker]]s and specialists flocked to Baku. By 1900 the city had more than 3,000 oil wells, of which 2,000 were producing oil at industrial levels. Baku ranked as one of the largest centres for the production of [[Petroleum industry|oil industry]] equipment before World War II. The World War II [[Battle of Stalingrad]] was fought to determine who would have control of the Baku oil fields. Fifty years before the battle, Baku produced half of the world's oil supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aghazade|first=Emil|title=Азербайджан: сто лет надежд|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/business/newsid_4649000/4649873.stm|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=12 May 2011|date=4 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently the oil economy of Baku is undergoing a resurgence, with the development of the massive [[Azeri–Chirag–Guneshli|Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli]] field (Shallow water Gunashli by [[State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic|SOCAR]], deeper areas by a consortium led by [[BP]]), development of the [[Shah Deniz gas field]], the expansion of the [[Sangachal Terminal]] and the construction of the [[Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline|BTC Pipeline]].

The [[Baku Stock Exchange]] is Azerbaijan's largest [[stock exchange]], and largest in the [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] region by [[market capitalization]]. A relatively large number of transnational companies are headquartered in Baku. One of the more prominent institutions headquartered in Baku is the [[International Bank of Azerbaijan]], which is run by [[Jahangir Hajiyev|Dr. Jahangir Hajiyev]] and employs over 1,000 people. International banks with branches in Baku include [[HSBC]], [[Société Générale]] and [[Credit Suisse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abdullayev|first=Rovshan|title=Which foreign banks has Azerbaijan capital been trusted in? |url=http://www.nhmt-az.org/ts_general/eng/news/n-6.htm|accessdate=6 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism and shopping===
Baku is one of the most important tourist destinations in the Caucasus, with hotels in the city earning 7 million euros in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azerbaijan24.com/component/content/article/1-latest-news/224-hotels-in-baku.html |title=Hotels in Baku earned 6,8 million euros last year |publisher=Azerbaijan24.com |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many sizable world [[hotel chain]]s have a presence in the city. Baku has many popular tourist and entertainment spots, such as the downtown [[Fountains Square, Baku|Fountains Square]], the One and Thousand Nights Beach, [[Shikhov Beach]] and [[Oil Rocks]].

===Architecture===
{{Main|Architecture in Baku}}
[[File:Baku Maiden Tower 2010.jpg|thumb|The [[Maiden Tower (Baku)|Maiden Tower]] in [[Old Baku]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] built in the 11th–12th century, recognized as the symbol of the city.]]
Baku has wildly varying architecture, ranging from the [[Old City (Baku)|Old City]] core to modern buildings and the spacious layout of the Baku port. Many of the city's most impressive buildings were built during the early 20th Century, when architectural elements of the European styles were combined in [[eclecticism|eclectic]] style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/24_folder/24_articles/24_architecture.html |title=Baku's Architecture:A Fusion of East and West |publisher=Azer.com |accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baku thus has an original and unique appearance, earning it a reputation as the 'Paris of the East'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.window2baku.com/006development.htm Архитектурное развитие города] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late modern and postmodern architecture began to appear in the early 2000s. With economic development, old buildings such as Atlant House were razed to make way for new ones. Buildings with all-glass shells have appeared around the city, the most prominent examples being the [[Azerbaijan Tower]], [[Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center]], [[Flame Towers]], [[Baku Crystal Hall]], [[Baku White City]] and [[SOCAR Tower]]. These projects also caught the attention of international media as notable programs such as [[Discovery Channel]]'s [[Extreme Engineering]] did pieces focusing in on changes to the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heydar Aliyev Cultural Center And Flame Towers|url=http://science.discovery.com/tv/build-bigger/projects/azerbaijan/heydar-aliyev-cultural-center.html|publisher=Discovery Communications|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Old City of Baku, also known as the Walled City of Baku, refers to the ancient Baku settlement. Most of the walls and towers, strengthened after the Russian conquest in 1806, survived. This section is picturesque, with its maze of narrow alleys and ancient buildings: the cobbled streets past the [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs]], two [[Caravanserai|caravansaries]], the baths and the [[Juma Mosque (Baku)|Juma Mosque]] (which used to house the [[Azerbaijan National Carpet Museum|Azerbaijan National Carpet and Arts Museum]] but is now a mosque again). The old town core also has dozens of small mosques, often without any particular sign to distinguish them as such.

In 2003, UNESCO placed the Inner City on the [[List of World Heritage in Danger]], citing damage from a [[2000 Baku earthquake|November 2000 earthquake]], poor conservation as well as &quot;dubious&quot; restoration efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/958 |title=Walled City of Baku with the Shirvanshah's Palace and Maiden Tower – UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |accessdate=22 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2010, the [[Baku International Sea Trade Port]] is being reconstructed. The construction will take place in three stages and will be completed by 2016. The estimated costs are 400 Million US$.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m-hesse.com/Aserbaidschan_Reisebericht.html|title=Azerbaijan, Baku|publisher=m-hesse.com|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; From April to November the Baku Port is accessible to ships loading cargoes for direct voyages from Western European and Mediterranean ports.

The State Road M-1 and the [[European route E60]] are the two main motorway connections between Europe and Azerbaijan. The motorway network around Baku is well developed and is constantly being extended.

The [[Heydar Aliyev International Airport]] is the only commercial airport serving Baku. The new [[Baku Cargo Terminal]] was officially opened in March 2005. It was constructed to be a major cargo hub in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries and is actually now one of the biggest and most technically advanced in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airport-technology.com/projects/baku/ |title=Heydar Aliyev International Airport (BAK/UBBB), Baku, Azerbaijan |publisher=Airport-technology.com |accessdate=17 April 2010| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20100312085043/http://www.airport-technology.com/projects/baku/| archivedate= 12 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also several smaller [[military airbase]]s near Baku, such as [[Baku Kala Air Base]], intended for private aircraft, [[helicopter]]s and charters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://az.apa.az/print.php?id=146672 Fevralın 14-ü Azərbaycan Hərbi Hava Qüvvələrinin (HHQ) yaranma günüdür] {{az icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
{{See also|List of universities in Baku}}
[[File:BDU logo.svg|thumb|Logo of [[Baku State University]], established in 1919 as Azerbaijan's first university]]
Baku hosts many universities, junior colleges and vocational schools. [[Baku State University]], the first established university in Azerbaijan was opened in 1919 by the government of the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]]. In the early years of the Soviet era, Baku already had [[Azerbaijan State Oil Academy]], [[Azerbaijan Medical University]] and [[Azerbaijan State Economic University]]. In the post-WWII period, a few more universities were established such as [[Azerbaijan Technical University]], [[Azerbaijan University of Languages]] and the [[Azerbaijan Architecture and Construction University]]. After 1991 when Azerbaijan gained independence from the Soviet Union, the fall of communism led to the development of a number of private institutions, including [[Qafqaz University]] and [[Khazar University]] which are currently considered the most prestigious academic institutions. Apart from the private universities, the government established the [[Academy of Public Administration (Azerbaijan)|Academy of Public Administration]], the [[Azerbaijan Diplomatic Academy]] and various military academies. The largest universities according to the student population are Baku State University and Azerbaijan State Economic University. In addition, there are the [[Baku Music Academy]] and the Azerbaijan National Conservatoire in Baku established in early 1920s. Publicly run kindergartens and elementary schools (years 1 through 11) are operated by local wards or municipal offices.

The [[Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences]], the main state research organization in Azerbaijan is locating in Baku as well. Moreover, Baku has numerous libraries, many of which contain vast collections of historic documents from the Roman, Byzantine, Ottoman and Soviet periods, as well as from other civilisations of the past. The most important libraries in terms of historic document collections include the [[Nizami Museum of Azerbaijan Literature]], the [[National Library of Azerbaijan]], the Mirza Alakbar Central Library, the Samad Vurgun Library and the Baku Presidential Library.

==Health care==
The city has many public and private hospitals, clinics and laboratories within its bounds and numerous medical research centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan: Energy-Rich, Healthcare-Poor|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav073008af.shtml|publisher=Eurasianet.org|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these facilities have [[high tech]]nology equipment, which has contributed to the recent upsurge in &quot;[[medical tourism]]&quot; to Baku, particularly from post-Soviet countries such as [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Moldova]], whose governments send lower-income patients to the city for inexpensive high-tech medical treatments and operations.

==Notable residents==
