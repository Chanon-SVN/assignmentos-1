'''Austria-Hungary''', also known as the '''Austro-Hungarian Empire''' and by [[#Names|other names]], was a [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutional]] union of the [[Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the Imperial Council|Empire of Austria]] and the [[Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown of Saint Stephen|Kingdom of Hungary]] that existed from 1867 to 1918, when it collapsed as a result of defeat in [[World War I]]. The union was a result of the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Compromise of 1867]]. It was ruled by the [[House of Habsburg]], and constituted the last phase in the constitutional evolution of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. Following the 1867 reforms, the Austrian and the Hungarian states were co-equal within the Empire. The Compromise required regular renewal, as did the customs union between the two halves of the Empire. Foreign affairs and the military fell under joint control, but all other government faculties were divided between the respective states.

Austria-Hungary was a [[multinational state|multinational realm]] and one of the world's [[great power]]s. Austria-Hungary was geographically the second-largest country in Europe after the [[Russian Empire]], at {{convert|621538|km2|sqmi|sp=us|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=ah1911/&gt; and the third-most populous (after Russia and the [[German Empire]]). The Empire built up the fourth-largest machine building industry of the world, after the [[United States]], Germany, and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;Schulze, Max-Stephan. ''Engineering and Economic Growth: The Development of Austria-Hungary's Machine-Building Industry in the Late Nineteenth Century'', {{nowrap|p. 295}}. Peter Lang ([[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]]), 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austro-Hungarian Empire consisted of two monarchies (Austria and Hungary) and one autonomous country under the Hungarian crown, [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia–Slavonia]], which negotiated [[Croatian–Hungarian Settlement|its own compromise]] (''Nagodba'') with Hungary in 1868. After 1878, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina under Austro-Hungarian rule|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was under Austro-Hungarian military and civilian rule&lt;ref&gt;Minahan, James. [http://books.google.ro/books?id=RSxt-JB-PDkC&amp;pg=PA48 ''Miniature Empires: A Historical Dictionary of the Newly Independent States'', {{nowrap|p. 48}}].&lt;/ref&gt; until it was fully annexed in 1908, provoking [[Bosnia Crisis|a diplomatic crisis]] among the other powers.&lt;ref name=b1911&gt;&quot;[[:s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Bosnia–Herzegovina|Bosnia–Herzegovina]]&quot; in the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', {{nowrap|11th ed.}} 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]], a province of the [[Ottoman Empire]], was also under joint occupation during that period but the Austro-Hungarian army withdrew as part of their annexation of Bosnia.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Frank Maloy and Amos Shartle Hershey, [https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/boshtml/bos128.htm ''Handbook for the Diplomatic History of Europe, Asia, and Africa 1870-1914.- The Austrian occupation of Novibazar, 1878-1909'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Austria-Hungary was one of the [[Central Powers]] in [[World War I]]. It was already effectively dissolved by the time the military authorities signed an [[armistice at Villa Giusti]] on 3 November 1918. The [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Hungarian Kingdom]] and the [[First Austrian Republic|Austrian Republic]] were treated as its [[Successor state|successors ''de jure'']], while the independence of the West Slavs and South Slavs of the Empire as the [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Republic of Czechoslovakia]] and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], respectively, was also recognized by the victorious powers.

==Structure and name==
[[File:Pietzner, Carl (1853-1927) - Emperor Franz Josef I - ca 1885.jpg|thumb|right|Franz Joseph I. (1885)]]

The realm's full, official name was '''&quot;The Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Council]] and the [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Lands of the Hungarian Holy Crown of St. Stephen]]&quot;'''.

In German: ''{{lang|de|Die im Reichsrat vertretenen Königreiche und Länder und die Länder der Heiligen Ungarischen Stephanskrone}}''

In Hungarian: ''{{lang|hu|A Birodalmi Tanácsban képviselt királyságok és országok és a Magyar Szent Korona országai}}''

The [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] monarch ruled as [[Emperor of Austria]]&lt;ref name=&quot;title&quot;/&gt; over the western and northern half of the country that was the [[Austrian Empire]] ([[Cisleithania]] or &quot;Lands represented in the Imperial Council&quot;)&lt;ref name=ah1911/&gt; and as [[King of Hungary]]&lt;ref name=&quot;title&quot;/&gt; over the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] ([[Transleithania]] or &quot;[[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=ah1911/&gt; Each enjoyed considerable sovereignty with only a few joint affairs (principally [[diplomacy|foreign relations]] and defence).&lt;ref name=&quot;responsible&quot;/&gt;

Certain regions, such as [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Polish Galicia]] within Cisleithania and Croatia within Hungary, enjoyed autonomous status, each with its own unique governmental structures (see: [[Austrian Poland#Galician autonomy|Polish Autonomy in Galicia]] and [[Croatian–Hungarian Settlement]]).

The division between Austria and Hungary was so marked that there was no common citizenship: one was either an Austrian citizen or a Hungarian citizen, never both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EvCfTIsTOskC&amp;pg=PA401 |title=Austria-Hungary and the Successor States: A Reference Guide from the Renaissance to the Present |author=Eric Roman |page=401 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-8160-7469-3 |accessdate=1 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=q48xAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=austria-hungary+%22common+citizenship%22 |title=The New Encyclopædia Britannica |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-85229-961-6 |accessdate=1 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This also meant that there were always separate Austrian and Hungarian passports, never a common one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epa.oszk.hu/00600/00691/00036/15.html |first=Ferenc Tibor| last=Szávai |title=Könyvszemle (Book review): Kozári Monika: ''A dualista rendszer (1867–1918)'': Modern magyar politikai rendszerek |work=Magyar Tudomány |issue=2006/12 |page=1542 |language=Hungarian |accessdate=20 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://tortenelemszak.elte.hu/data/25756/SzavaiFeri.pdf |first=Ferenc |last=Szávai |title=Osztrák-magyar külügyi ingatlanok hovatartozása a Monarchia felbomlása után |language=Hungarian| page=598 |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Empire of Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary had always maintained separate parliaments: the [[Imperial Council (Austria)]] and the [[Diet of Hungary]]. Except for the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]], common laws never existed in the Empire of Austria and the Kingdom of Hungary.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} All laws, even those with identical content such as the compromise of 1867, had to pass the parliaments of both Vienna and Budapest. They were published in the respective official media: in the Austrian part it was called ''[[Reichsgesetzblatt]],'' and was issued in eight languages.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The administration and government of the Kingdom of Hungary (between 1527 and 1848) were not united with the administration and government structure of the Austrian Empire. Hungary's central government structures remained well separated from the imperial government: the two were linked largely in the person of the common monarch. The country was governed by the Council of Lieutenancy of Hungary (the Gubernium) - located in [[Bratislava|Pressburg]] and later in [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] - and by the Hungarian Royal Court Chancellery in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Éva H. Balázs: Hungary and the Habsburgs, 1765–1800: An Experiment in Enlightened Absolutism. p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian government and Hungarian parliament were suspended after the Hungarian revolution of 1848, and they regained their former status after the Austro-Hungarian Compromise in 1867.

Despite Austria and Hungary sharing a common currency, they were fiscally sovereign and independent entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=European Review of Economic History|date=April 2006|volume=10|issue=1|first=Marc|last=Flandreau|asin=B00440PZZC |id=1361–4916|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=431004|pages=3–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the beginnings of the personal union (from 1527), the government of the Kingdom of Hungary could preserve its separated and independent budget. After the revolution of 1848–1849, the Hungarian budget was amalgamated with the Austrian, and it was only after the Compromise of 1867 that Hungary obtained a separate budget.&lt;ref name=h1911&gt;&quot;[[:s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Hungary|Hungary]]&quot; in the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', {{nowrap|11th ed.}}, {{nowrap|Vol. XIII}}, {{nowrap|p. 900}}. 1911.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1527 (the creation of the monarchic [[personal union]]) to 1851, the Kingdom of Hungary maintained its own customs controls, which separated her from the other parts of the Habsburg-ruled territories.&lt;ref&gt;Richard L. Rudolph: Banking and Industrialization in Austria-Hungary: The Role of Banks in the Industrialization of the Czech Crownlands, 1873–1914, Cambridge University Press, 2008 (page 17)&lt;/ref&gt; After 1867, the Austrian and Hungarian customs union agreement had to be renegotiated and stipulated every ten years. The agreements were renewed and signed by Vienna and Budapest at the end of every decade because both countries hoped to derive mutual economic benefit from the customs union. The Austrian Empire and Kingdom of Hungary contracted their foreign commercial treaties independently of each other.&lt;ref name=ah1911&gt;&quot;[[:s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Austria-Hungary|Austria-Hungary]]&quot; in the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', {{nowrap|11th ed.}} 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

Austria-Hungary was a [[great power]] but it contained a large number of ethnic groups that sought their own nation. It was ruled by a coalition of two powerful minorities, the Germans and the Hungarians. Stresses regarding nationalism were building up, and the severe shock of a poorly handled war caused the system to collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5oJ7HpQu4GgC&amp;pg=PA201 |title=Disaster Ending in Final Victory: The Dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire |author=Gaetano Cavallaro |publisher=Gaetano Cavallaro |year=2010 |page=201 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AwxMAaCXTfwC&amp;pg=PA130 |title=Researching World War I: A Handbook |authors=Robin D. S. Higham, Dennis E. Showalter |page=130 |publisher=Greenwood |year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vienna served as the Monarchy's primary capital. The Cisleithanian (Austrian) part contained about 57 percent of the total population and the larger share of its economic resources, compared to the Hungarian part.

{{anchor|Names}}
Following a decision of [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph II]] in 1868, the realm bore the official name of the &quot;'''Austro-Hungarian Monarchy'''&quot; in its international relations. This was ''{{lang|de|Österreichisch-Ungarische Monarchie}}'' in German and ''{{lang|hu|Osztrák-Magyar Monarchia}}'' in Hungarian. It was often contracted to the '''Dual Monarchy''' in English of the time or simply referenced as '''Austria'''.&lt;ref name=eb9&gt;&quot;[[:s:Encyclopædia Britannica, Ninth Edition/Austria|Austria]]&quot; in the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', {{nowrap|9th ed.}}, {{nowrap|Vol. III}}. 1878.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867}}

The [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]] (called the ''Ausgleich'' in German and the ''Kiegyezés'' in Hungarian), which inaugurated the empire's dual structure in place of the former [[unitary state|unitary]] [[Austrian Empire]] (1804–67), originated at a time when Austria had declined in strength and in power—both in the [[Italian Peninsula]] (as a result of the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] of 1859) and among the states of the [[German Confederation]] (it had been surpassed by [[Prussia]] as the dominant German-speaking power following the [[Austro-Prussian War]], also named the German War, of 1866).&lt;ref&gt;Kann (1974); Sked (1989); Taylor (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other factors in the constitutional changes were continued Hungarian dissatisfaction with rule from Vienna and increasing national consciousness on the part of other nationalities (or ethnicities) of the Austrian Empire. Hungarian dissatisfaction arose partly from Austria's suppression with [[Russian Empire|Russian]] support of the [[Revolutions of 1848|Hungarian liberal revolution]] of 1848–49. However, dissatisfaction with Austrian rule had grown for many years within Hungary and had many other causes.

By the late 1850s, a large number of Hungarians who had supported the 1848–49 revolution were willing to accept the Habsburg monarchy. They argued that while Hungary had the right to full internal independence, under the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]], foreign affairs and defense were &quot;common&quot; to both Austria and Hungary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kann 1974&quot;&gt;Kann (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Austrian defeat at [[Battle of Königgrätz|Königgrätz]], the government realized it needed to reconcile with Hungary to regain the status of a great power. The new foreign minister, [[Count Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust]], wanted to conclude the stalemated negotiations with the Hungarians. To secure the monarchy, Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] began negotiations for a compromise with the [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] nobility, led by [[Ferenc Deák]], to ensure their support. In particular, Hungarian leaders demanded and received the Emperor's coronation as King of Hungary and the re-establishment of a separate parliament at [[Budapest]] with powers to enact laws for the lands of the [[Holy Crown of Hungary]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kann 1974&quot;/&gt;

From 1867 onwards, the abbreviations heading the names of official institutions in Austria-Hungary reflected their responsibility: {{lang|de|K. u. k.}} (''{{lang|de|kaiserlich und königlich}}'' or [[Imperial and Royal]]) was the label for institutions common to both parts of the Monarchy, e.g. the ''{{lang|de|k.u.k. Kriegsmarine}}'' (War Fleet) and, during the war, the ''{{lang|de|k.u.k. Armee}}'' (Army). There were three ''{{lang|de|k.u.k.}}'' or joint ministries:
* The Imperial and Royal Ministry of the Exterior and the Imperial House
* The Imperial and Royal War Ministry
* The Imperial and Royal Ministry of Finance

The last was responsible only for financing the Imperial and Royal household, the diplomatic service, the common army and the common war fleet. All other state functions were to be handled separately by each of the two states.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor 1964&quot;&gt;Taylor (1964)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1867 onwards, common expenditures were allocated 70% to Austria and 30% to Hungary. This split had to be negotiated every 10 years. By 1907, the Hungarian share had risen to 36.4%.&lt;ref name=&quot;kronenbitter&quot;/&gt; The negotiations in 1917 ended with the dissolution of the Dual Monarchy.

The common army changed its label from ''{{lang|de|k.k.}}'' to ''{{lang|de|k.u.k.}}'' only in 1889 at the request of the Hungarian government.

* ''{{lang|de|K. k.}}'' (''{{lang|de|kaiserlich-königlich}}'') or [[Imperial-Royal]] was the term for institutions of [[Cisleithania]] (Austria); &quot;royal&quot; in this label referred to the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Crown of Bohemia]].
* ''{{lang|de|K. u.}}'' (''{{lang|de|königlich-ungarisch}}'') or ''{{lang|de|M. k.}}'' (''{{lang|de|Magyar királyi}}'') (&quot;Hungarian Royal&quot;) referred to [[Transleithania]], the lands of the Hungarian crown.

===Government===
{{See also|Imperial Council (Austria)|Diet of Hungary}}
There were three parts to the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire:&lt;ref&gt;Kann, ''A History of the Habsburg Empire: 1526–1918'' (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;

#common foreign, military and joint financial policy under the monarch
#the &quot;Austrian&quot; or Cisleithanian government
#the Hungarian government

Hungary and Austria maintained separate [[parliament]]s each with its own [[prime minister]]. Linking/co-ordinating the two parliaments fell to a government under the monarch. In this sense Austria-Hungary remained under an authoritarian government, as the Emperor-King appointed both Austrian and Hungarian Prime ministers along with their respective cabinets. In the Hungarian half, the King-appointed Government was responsible only to the Parliament instead of the King, which gave Hungary a great amount of autonomy, especially in internal matters. In the Austrian half, however, the Emperor had the power to both appoint and dismiss its Prime minister and cabinet members. The monarch's common government, in which its ministers were appointed by the Monarch and responsible to him, had the responsibility for the [[Austro-Hungarian Army|army]], for the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy|navy]], for foreign policy, and for the [[customs union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kann 1974&quot;/&gt;

Due to the lack of common law between Austria and Hungary, to conclude identical texts, each parliament elected 60 of its members to form a delegation that discussed motions of the Imperial &amp; Royal ministries separately and worked towards a compromise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor 1964&quot;/&gt;

A common Ministerial Council ruled the common government: it comprised the three ministers for the joint responsibilities (joint finance, military, and foreign policy), the two prime ministers, some Archdukes and the monarch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sked 1989&quot;&gt;Sked (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; Two delegations of representatives (60–60 members), one each from the Austrian and Hungarian parliaments, met separately and voted on the expenditures of the Common Ministerial Council giving the two governments influence in the common administration. However, the ministers ultimately answered only to the monarch who had the final decision on matters of foreign and military policy.

Overlapping responsibilities between the joint ministries and the ministries of the two halves caused friction and inefficiencies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor 1964&quot;/&gt; The armed forces suffered particularly from overlap. Although the unified government determined the overall military direction, the Austrian and Hungarian governments each remained in charge of recruiting, supplies and training. Each government could have a strong influence over common governmental responsibilities. Each half of the Dual Monarchy proved quite prepared to disrupt common operations to advance its own interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sked 1989&quot;/&gt;

Relations during the half-century after 1867 between the two parts of the Empire featured repeated disputes over shared external tariff arrangements and over the financial contribution of each government to the common treasury. Under the terms of the &quot;Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867&quot;, an agreement renegotiated every ten years, determined these matters. There was political turmoil during the build-up to each renewal of the agreement. The disputes between the two parts of the Empire culminated in the early 1900s in a prolonged [[constitutional crisis]]. It was triggered by disagreement over which language to use for command in [[Military of Hungary|Hungarian army]] units, and deepened by the advent to power in Budapest in April 1906 of a Hungarian nationalist coalition. Provisional renewals of the common arrangements occurred in October 1907 and in November 1917 on the basis of the ''status quo''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor 1964&quot;/&gt;

===Judicial system===

'''Empire of Austria'''

{{Expand section|date=March 2013}}

'''Kingdom of Hungary'''

The judicial power was independent of the administrative power. The judicial authorities in Hungary were:

(1) the district courts with single judges (458 in 1905);
 
(2) the county courts with collegiate judgeships (76 in number); to these were attached 15 jury courts for press offences. These were courts of first instance.

(3) Royal Tables (12 in number), which were courts of second instance, established at Budapest, Debrecen, Győr, Kassa, Kolozsvár, Marosvásárhely, Nagyvárad, Pécs, Pressburg, Szeged, Temesvár and Zagreb.

(4) The Royal Supreme Court at Budapest, and the Supreme Court of Justice, or Table of Septemvirs, at Zagrab, which were the highest judicial authorities. There were also a special commercial court at Budapest, a naval court at Fiume, and special army courts.&lt;ref name=ah1911/&gt;

The organization of the administrative system in the Austrian Empire was complicated by the fact that between the State and the purely local communal administration there intruded yet a third element, grounded in history, the territories (Lander). The State administration comprised all affairs having relation to rights, duties and interests &quot; which are common to all territories&quot;; all other administrative tasks were left to the territories. Finally, the communes had self-government within their own sphere.

To this division of the work of administration corresponded a three-fold organization of the authorities: State, territorial and communal. The State authorities were divided on geographical lines into central, intermediate and local, and side by side with this there was a division of the offices for the transaction of business according to the various branches of the administration. The central authorities, which as early as the 18th century worked together in a common mother cell of the State chancery, became differentiated so soon as the growing tasks of administration called for specialization; in 1869 there were seven departments, and in the concluding decade of the Austrian Empire there were set up Ministries of Labour, Food, Public Health and Social Care. Under these ministries came the Statthalter, whose administrative area had ordinarily the proportions of a Crown territory (Kronland); but the immense variations in area of the Crown territories made a uniform and consistent intermediate administrative organization practically impossible. The lowest administrative unit was the political sub-district (Bezirk) under an official (Bezirkshauptmann), who united nearly all the administrative functions which were divided among the various ministries according to their attributions.&lt;ref name=ah1911/&gt;

'''Kingdom of Hungary'''

As regards local government, the country was divided into municipalities or counties, which possessed a certain amount of self-government. Hungary proper was divided into sixty-three rural, and – including Fiume – twenty-six urban municipalities (see section on Administrative Divisions). These urban municipalities were towns which for their local government were independent of the counties in which they were situated, and have, therefore, a larger amount of municipal autonomy than the communes or the other towns. The administration of the municipalities is carried on by an official appointed by the king, aided by a representative body. Since 1876 each municipality had a council of twenty members to exercise control over its administration. According to this division Hungary proper is divided into seven circles.

Besides these sixty-three rural counties for Hungary, and eight for Croatia-Slavonia, Hungary had twenty-six urban counties or towns with municipal rights. These were: Arad, Baja, Debreczen, Győr, Hódmezővasarhely, Kassa, Kecskemét, Kolozsvár, Komarom, Marosvásárhely, Nagyvárad, Pancsova, Pécs, Pozsony, Selmecz-es Bélabanya, Sopron, Szabadka, Szatmárnémeti, Szeged, Székesfehervár, Temesvár, Újvidék, Versecz, Zombor, the town of Fiume, and Budapest, the capital of the county.

In [[Croatia-Slavonia]] there were three urban counties or towns with municipal rights namely: Osijek, Varaždin and Zagreb.

===Politics===
{{See also|Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen}}
The first prime minister of Hungary after the Compromise was Count [[Gyula Andrássy]] (1867–1871). The old Hungarian Constitution was restored, and Franz Joseph was crowned as King of Hungary. Andrássy next served as the Foreign Minister of Austria-Hungary (1871–1879).

The Empire relied increasingly on a cosmopolitan bureaucracy&amp;nbsp;– in which Czechs played an important role&amp;nbsp;– backed by loyal elements, including a large part of the German, Hungarian, Polish and Croat aristocracy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Analysis: Austria's troubled history&quot;/&gt;

====Political struggles in the Empire====
The traditional aristocracy and land-based gentry class gradually faced increasingly wealthy men of the cities, who achieved wealth through trade and industrialization. The urban middle and upper class tended to seek their own power and supported progressive movements in the aftermath of revolutions in Europe. They were described as &quot;leftist liberals&quot; and their representatives began to be elected to the parliaments of Vienna and Budapest. These leftist liberal parliamentary parties were backed by the big industrialists, bankers, businessmen and the predominant majority of newspaper publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary B. Cohen|title=The Politics of Ethnic Survival: Germans in Prague, 1861–1914|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ydRVnwglOxQC&amp;pg=PA53|year=2006|publisher=Purdue University Press|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in the German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire frequently used liberal economic policies and practices. From the 1860s, businessmen succeeded in industrializing parts of the Empire. Newly prosperous members of the [[bourgeoisie]] erected large homes, and began to take prominent roles in urban life that rivaled the aristocracy's. In the early period of the Empire, they encouraged the government to seek foreign investment to build up infrastructure, such as railroads, in aid of industrialization, transportation and communications, and development.

The influence of liberals in Austria, most of them ethnic Germans, weakened under the leadership of [[Eduard Taaffe, 11th Viscount Taaffe|Count Edouard von Taaffe]], the Austrian prime minister from 1879 to 1893. Taaffe used a coalition of clergy, conservatives and Slavic parties to weaken the liberals. In [[Bohemia]], for example, he authorized [[Czech language|Czech]] as an official language of the bureaucracy and school system, thus breaking the German speakers' monopoly on holding office. Such reforms encouraged other ethnic groups to push for greater autonomy as well. By playing nationalities off one another, the government ensured the monarchy's central role in holding together competing interest groups in an era of rapid change.

During the First World War, rising national sentiments and labour movements contributed to strikes, protests and civil unrest in the Empire. After the war, republican, national parties contributed to the disintegration and collapse of the monarchy in Austria and Hungary. Republics were established in Vienna and Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Aviel Roshwald|title=Ethnic Nationalism and the Fall of Empires: Central Europe, the Middle East and Russia, 1914–23|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ba97xyhIZDcC&amp;pg=PA116|year=2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign policy===
{{see also|International relations (1814–1919)|Foreign Ministry of Austria-Hungary}}
[[File:Sarajevo 1878..jpg|thumb|right|Muslim Bosniak resistance during the battle of Sarajevo in 1878 against the [[Austro-Hungarian campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878|Austro-Hungarian occupation]].]] 
The minister of foreign affairs conducted the foreign relations of the Dual Monarchy, and negotiated treaties.&lt;ref&gt;F.R. Bridge, ''From Sadowa to Sarajevo: The Foreign Policy of Austria-Hungary 1866–1914'' (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dual Monarchy was created in the wake of a losing war in 1866 with Prussia and Italy. To rebuild Habsburg prestige and gain revenge against Prussia, [[Count Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust]] became foreign secretary. He hated Prussia's diplomat, [[Otto von Bismarck]], who had repeatedly outmaneuvered him. Beust looked to France and negotiated with Emperor [[Napoleon III]] and Italy for an anti-Prussian alliance. No terms could be reached. The decisive victory of Prusso-German armies in the war of 1870 with France and the founding of the German Empire ended all hope of revenge and Beust retired.&lt;ref&gt;Hans A. Schmitt, &quot;Count Beust and Germany, 1866–1870: Reconquest, Realignment, or Resignation?&quot; ''Central European History'' (1968) 1#1 p. 20–34 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/4545476 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

After being forced out of Germany and Italy, the Dual Monarchy turned to the Balkans, which were in tumult as nationalistic efforts were trying to end the rule of the Ottomans. Both Russia and Austria-Hungary saw an opportunity to expand in this region. Russia in particular took on the role of protector of the Slavs and the orthodox Christians. Austria envisioned a multi-ethnic, religiously diverse empire under Vienna's control. Count [[Gyula Andrássy]], a Hungarian who was Foreign Minister of the Empire (1871 to 1879), made the centerpiece of his policy one of opposition to Russian expansion in the Balkans and blocking Serbian ambitions to dominate a new South Slav federation. He wanted Germany to ally with Austria, not Russia.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Langer, ''European Alliances and Alignments: 1871–1890'' (2nd ed. 1950) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

When Russia defeated Turkey in a war the resulting [[Treaty of San Stefano]] was seen in Austria as much too favourable for Russia and its Orthodox-Slavic goals. The [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878 let Austria occupy (but not annex) the province of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], a predominantly Slavic area. In 1914, Slavic militants in Bosnia rejected Austria's plan to fully absorb the area; they [[assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinated the Austrian heir]] and precipitated World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Langer, ''European Alliances and Alignments: 1871–1890'' pp. 138, 155–6, 163&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Austria-Hungary}}
[[File:BanknoteA-H.jpg|thumb|right|A 20-[[Austro-Hungarian krone|crown]] banknote of the Dual Monarchy, using all official languages]]
The Austro-Hungarian economy changed dramatically during the Dual Monarchy. The [[capitalism|capitalist]] way of production spread throughout the Empire during its 50-year existence, replacing medieval{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} institutions. [[Technological change]] accelerated [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]]. The first Austrian stock exchange (the [[Wiener Börse]]) was opened in 1771 in Vienna, the first stock exchange of the Kingdom of Hungary (the [[Budapest Stock Exchange]]) was opened in Budapest in 1864. The [[central bank]] of the Empire (Bank of issue) was founded as Austrian National Bank in 1816. In 1878, it transformed into Austro-Hungarian National Bank with principal offices in both Vienna and Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Barcsay: Banking in Hungarian economic development 1867–1919, (Publisher: Ryeson Polytechnical Institute, 1991) page: 216. [http://www.thebhc.org/publications/BEHprint/v020/p0216-p0225.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The central bank was governed by alternating Austrian or Hungarian governors and vice-governors.&lt;ref&gt;Peter F. Sugar, Péter Hanák: A History of Hungary (Publisher: Indiana University Press ) Page: 262&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Measures of national income and output|gross national product]] per capita grew roughly 1.76% per year from 1870 to 1913. That level of growth compared very favorably to that of other European nations such as Britain (1%), France (1.06%), and Germany (1.51%).&lt;ref name=&quot;economic&quot;/&gt; However, in a comparison with Germany and Britain, the Austro-Hungarian economy as a whole still lagged considerably, as sustained modernization had begun much later. Like the German Empire, that of Austria-Hungary frequently employed liberal economic policies and practices. In 1873, the old Hungarian capital Buda and Óbuda (Ancient Buda) were officially merged with the third city, Pest, thus creating the new metropolis of Budapest. The dynamic Pest grew into Hungary's administrative, political, economic, trade and cultural hub. Many of the state institutions and the modern administrative system of Hungary were established during this period. Economic growth centered on [[Vienna]] and [[Budapest]], the Austrian lands (areas of modern Austria), the Alpine region and the Bohemian lands. In the later years of the 19th century, rapid economic growth spread to the central [[Great Hungarian Plain|Hungarian plain]] and to the Carpathian lands. As a result, wide disparities of development existed within the empire. In general, the western areas became more developed than the eastern. The Kingdom of Hungary became the world's second largest flour exporter after the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|author=Max-Stephan Schulze|title=Engineering and Economic Growth: The Development of Austria-Hungary's Machine-Building Industry in the Late Nineteenth Century|publisher=Frankfurt am Main: Peter Lang|year=1996|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large Hungarian food exports were not limited to neighbouring Germany and Italy: Hungary became the most important foreign food supplier of the large cities and industrial centres of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Commercial Relations of the United States: Reports from the Consuls of the United States on the Commerce, Manufactures, Etc., of Their Consular Districts. Publisher: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1881 (page: 371)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by the end of the 19th century, economic differences gradually began to even out as economic growth in the eastern parts of the Empire consistently surpassed that in the western. The strong agriculture and [[food industry]] of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] with the centre of [[Budapest]] became predominant within the empire and made up a large proportion of the export to the rest of Europe. Meanwhile, western areas, concentrated mainly around [[Prague]] and Vienna, excelled in various manufacturing industries. This [[division of labour]] between the east and west, besides the existing [[economic and monetary union]], led to an even more rapid economic growth throughout Austria-Hungary by the early 20th century. Austria could preserve its dominance within the empire in the sectors of the [[first industrial revolution]], but Hungary had a better position in the industries of the [[second industrial revolution]], in these modern industrial sectors the Austrian competition could not become overwhelming.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan T. Berend: &quot;''Case Studies on Modern European Economy: Entrepreneurship, Inventions, and Institutions''&quot;, Routledge, 2013, page 151 [http://books.google.com/books?id=L_GEE9YDgtYC&amp;pg=PA151&amp;dq=%22Hungary+had+a+better+position+in+the+new+industries+of+the+second+industrial+revolution%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NSU3UozILMqRtQbonIDwCw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Hungary%20had%20a%20better%20position%20in%20the%20new%20industries%20of%20the%20second%20industrial%20revolution%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

The empire's [[heavy industry]] had mostly focused on machine building, especially for the [[electric power industry]], [[History of rail transport|locomotive industry]] and [[automotive industry]], while in [[light industry]] the [[precision mechanics]] industry was the most dominant. Through the years leading up to [[World War I]] the country became the 4th biggest machine manufacturer in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The two most important trading partners were traditionally Germany (1910: 48% of all exports, 39% of all imports), and Great Britain (1910: almost 10% of all exports, 8% of all imports), the third most important partner was the United States, it followed by Russia, France, Switzerland, Rumania, the Balkan states and South America.&lt;ref name=ah1911/&gt; Trade with the geographically neighbouring Russia, however, had a relatively low weight (1910: 3% of all exports /mainly machinery for Russia, 7% of all imports /mainly raw materials from Russia).

===Transport===

====Railways====

{{Main|Imperial Austrian State Railways|Hungarian State Railways}}

[[Rail transport]] expanded rapidly in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Its [[predecessor state]], the [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Empire]], had built a substantial core of railways in the west, originating from Vienna, by 1841. Austria's [[Emperor Ferdinand Northern Railway|first steam railway]] from Vienna to [[Moravia]] with its terminus in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] (Bochnie) was opened in 1839. The first train travelled from Vienna to Lundenburg (Břeclav) on 6 June 1839 and one month later between the imperial capital in Vienna and the capital of Moravia [[Brno|Brünn]] (Brno) on 7 July. At that point, the government realized the military possibilities of rail and began to invest heavily in construction. [[Pozsony]] ([[Bratislava]]), [[Budapest]], [[Prague]], [[Kraków]], [[Graz]], Laibach ([[Ljubljana]]) and [[Venice|Venedig]] ([[Venice]]) became linked to the main network. By 1854, the empire had almost {{convert|2000|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on}} of track, about 60–70% of it in state hands. The government then began to sell off large portions of track to private investors to recoup some of its investments and because of the financial strains of the [[Revolutions of 1848|1848 Revolution]] and of the [[Crimean War]].

From 1854 to 1879, private interests conducted almost all rail construction. What would become Cisleithania gained {{convert|7952|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on}} of track, and Hungary built {{convert|5839|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on}} of track. During this time, many new areas joined the railway system and the existing rail networks gained connections and interconnections. This period marked the beginning of widespread rail transportation in Austria-Hungary, and also the integration of transportation systems in the area. Railways allowed the empire to integrate its economy far more than previously possible, when transportation depended on rivers.

After 1879, the Austrian and the Hungarian governments slowly began to renationalize their rail networks, largely because of the sluggish pace of development during the worldwide [[depression (economics)|depression]] of the 1870s. Between 1879 and 1900, more than {{convert|25000|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on}} of railways were built in Cisleithania and Hungary. Most of this constituted &quot;filling in&quot; of the existing network, although some areas, primarily in the far east, gained rail connections for the first time. The railway reduced transportation costs throughout the empire, opening new markets for products from other lands of the Dual Monarchy. In 1914, of a total of {{convert|22981|km|2|sp=us|abbr=on}} of railway tracks on Austrian part of the Empire, {{convert|18859|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on}} (82%) were state owned.

The first Hungarian steam locomotive railway line was opened on 15 July 1846 between [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] and [[Vác]].&lt;ref&gt;Mikulas Teich,Roy Porter: The Industrial Revolution in National Context: Europe and the USA (page: 266.)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 most large Hungarian private railway companies were nationalized as a consequence of the poor management of private companies, except the strong Austrian-owned Kaschau-Oderberg Railway (KsOd) and the Austrian-Hungarian Southern Railway (SB/DV). They also joined the zone tariff system of the MÁV (Hungarian State Railways). By 1910, the total length of the rail networks of Hungarian Kingdom reached 22,869&amp;nbsp;km (14,210&amp;nbsp;mi), the Hungarian network linked more than 1,490 settlements. Nearly half of the empire's railways were built in Hungary, thus the railroad density there became higher than that of Cisleithania. This has ranked Hungarian railways the 6th most dense in the world (ahead of countries as Germany or France).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=a9csmhIT_BQC&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=%22steel+output%22+%22austria-hungary%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22steel%20output%22%20%22austria-hungary%22&amp;f=false|title=History Derailed: Central and Eastern Europe in the Long Nineteenth Century|author=Tibor Iván Berend|language=Hungarian|page=152|publisher=University of California Press|year=2003|page=330|isbn=978-0-520-23299-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Horse-drawn tramway]]s appeared in the first half of the 19th century. Between the 1850s and 1880s many horse-drawn tramways were built in the municipalities of the empire. [[Wien]] (1865), Budapest (1866), Brno (1869). Steam trams appeared in the late 1860s. The electrification of tramways started from the late 1880s. The first electrified tramway in Austria-Hungary was built in Budapest in 1887.

====Shipping and ports====

The most significant seaport was [[Trieste]] (today part of Italy), where the Austrian merchant marine was based. In addition, the two major shipping companies (Austrian Lloyd and Austro-Americana) and several shipyards were located there. The k.u.k. navy used the port's shipyards to construct new naval ships. This port grew as Venice declined. From 1815 to 1866, Venice was included within the monarchy and was prevented from competing with Austrian-ruled ports. The merchant marine did not develop until Venice's shipping interest declined. The navy became significant during the time of the k.u.k. monarchy, as industrialization and development provided sufficient revenues to develop it.

The most important seaport for the Hungarian part of the k.u.k. was Fiume ([[Rijeka]], today part of Croatia), where the Hungarian shipping companies, such as the Adria, operated. The largest Hungarian shipbuilding company was the Ganz-Danubius. Another significant seaport was Pola ([[Pula]], today part of Croatia)&amp;nbsp;– especially for the navy. In 1889, the Austrian merchant marine consisted of 10,022 ships, with 7,992 fishing vessels. The coast and sea trade had a total of 1,859 sailboats with crews of 6,489 men and a load capacity of 140,838 tons; and 171 steamers with a load capacity of 96,323 tons and a crew of 3,199 men.

The first Danubian steamer company, Donau-Dampfschiffahrt-Gesellschaft (DDSG), was the largest inland shipping company in the world until the collapse of the k.u.k. The Austrian Lloyd was one of the biggest ocean shipping companies of the time. Prior to the beginning of World War I, the company owned 65 middle-sized and large steamers. The Austro-Americana owned one third of them, including the biggest Austrian passenger ship, the SS ''Kaiser Franz Joseph I''. In comparison to the Austrian Lloyd, the Austro-American concentrated on destinations in North and South America.&lt;ref name=&quot;dradio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;theshipslist&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dame&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aeiou&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;www&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;danube&quot;/&gt;

====Telegraph====
In 1847, the first telegraph connection (Vienna – Brno – Prague) started operation.&lt;ref&gt;Paula Sutter Fichtner: Historical Dictionary of Austria (p.69)&lt;/ref&gt; The first telegraph station on Hungarian territory was opened in December 1847 in Pressburg/ Pozsony /[[Bratislava]]/. In 1848, – during the Hungarian Revolution – another telegraph centre was built in [[Buda]] to connect the most important governmental centres. The first telegraph connection between Vienna and Pest – Buda (later Budapest) was constructed in 1850.&lt;ref name=&quot;docs.google.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:9_PYHC6wqAUJ:www.vasynet.com/downloads/doc2/isi/Debreceni%2520Egyetem%2520-%2520Mernok%2520Informatika/Tavkozlo%2520halozatok/jegyzet%2520az%2520ftp-rol/Telekommunikacio/TKMI.doc+&amp;hl=hu&amp;gl=hu&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgFOvFjnmltg5B4xWPUKJAXbSI07Gv_HUm7SPM0yjzsFdbW_hN0yElBODWJ3NTNOTml7LcHMCYXlCZSlq1wTo1s6LIvCzomBdBq5SxAqhkb84nOiK2sS1pS4TyIfV1FmhPp_9z7&amp;sig=AHIEtbTApFj3flFRjvilOnBd883Fc-MHhQ |title=Google Drive – Megtekintő |publisher=Docs.google.com |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in 1850, Austria joined a telegraph union with German states.&lt;ref&gt;Kiesewetter, Herbert: ''Industrielle Revolution in Deutschland.

In July 1849, the Hungarian Revolutionary Parliament proclaimed and enacted ethnic and minority rights. (The next such laws were in Switzerland), but these were overturned after the Russian and Austrian armies crushed the Hungarian Revolution. After the Kingdom of Hungary reached the Compromise with the Habsburg Dynasty in 1867, one of the first acts of its restored Parliament was to pass a Law on Nationalities (Act Number XLIV of 1868). It was a liberal piece of legislation, and offered extensive language and cultural rights. It did not recognize non-Hungarians to have rights to form states with any territorial autonomy.&lt;ref name=&quot;suedosteuropa-gesellschaft&quot;/&gt;

The &quot;Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867&quot; created the semi-independent states of Hungary and Austria linked by personal union under a common monarch. The Hungarian majority asserted more of their identity within the Kingdom of Hungary. The nationalism of German speakers prevalent in the Empire of Austria created tension between [[ethnic Germans]] and [[Czechs|ethnic Czechs]]. In addition, the emergence of [[nation|national identity]] in the newly independent Romania and Serbia also contributed to ethnic issues in the empire.

Article 19 of the 1867 &quot;Basic State Act&quot; (''Staatsgrundgesetz''), valid only for the Cisleithanian (Austrian) part of Austria-Hungary,&lt;ref name=&quot;verfassungen&quot;/&gt; said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;All races of the empire have equal rights, and every race has an inviolable right to the preservation and use of its own nationality and language. The equality of all customary languages (&quot;{{lang|de|landesübliche Sprachen}}&quot;) in school, office and public life, is recognized by the state. In those territories in which several races dwell, the public and educational institutions are to be so arranged that, without applying compulsion to learn a second country language (&quot;{{lang|de|Landessprache}}&quot;), each of the races receives the necessary means of education in its own language.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The implementation of this principle led to several disputes, as it was not clear which languages could be regarded as &quot;customary&quot;. The Germans, the traditional bureaucratic, capitalist and cultural elite, demanded the recognition of their language as a customary language in every part of the empire. Italian was regarded as an old &quot;culture language&quot; (''{{lang|de|Kultursprache}}'') by German intellectuals and had always been granted [[Social equality|equal rights]] as an [[official language]] of the Empire, but the Germans had difficulty in accepting the [[Slavic languages]] as equal to their own. On one occasion [[Count Anton Alexander von Auersperg|Count A. Auersperg]] (Anastasius Grün) entered the Diet of [[Carniola]] carrying what he claimed to be the whole [[text corpus|corpus]] of [[Slovene literature]] under his arm; this was to demonstrate that the [[Slovene language]] could not be substituted for German as the language of higher education.

The following years saw official recognition of several languages, at least in Austria. From 1867, laws awarded [[Croatian language|Croatian]] equal status with Italian in [[Dalmatia]]. From 1882, there was a Slovene majority in the Diet of Carniola and in the capital [[Ljubljana|Laibach (Ljubljana)]]; they ruled to replace German with Slovene as their primary official language. [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] designated Polish instead of German in 1869 as the customary language of government. The Poles systematically disregarded the large [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] minority in their territory, and did not grant [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] the status of an official language.

The language disputes were most fiercely fought in [[Bohemia]], where the Czech speakers formed a majority and sought equal status for their language to German. The [[Czechs]] had lived primarily in [[Bohemia]] since the 6th century and German immigrants had begun settling the Bohemian periphery since the 13th century. The constitution of 1627 made the German language a second official language and equal to Czech. German speakers lost their majority in the Bohemian Diet in 1880 and became a minority to Czech speakers in the cities of [[Prague]] and [[Plzeň|Pilsen]] (while retaining a slight numerical majority in the city of [[Brno|Brno (Brünn)]]). The old [[Charles University in Prague]], hitherto dominated by German speakers, was divided into German and Czech-speaking faculties in 1882.

At the same time, Hungarian dominance faced challenges from the local majorities of [[Romanians]] in [[Transylvania]] and in the eastern [[Banat]], [[Slovaks]] in today's [[Slovakia]], and [[Croats]] and [[Serbs]] in the crown lands of [[Croatia]] and of [[Dalmatia]] (today's Croatia), in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and in the provinces known as the [[Vojvodina]] (today's northern [[Serbia]]). The Romanians and the Serbs began to agitate for union with their fellow nationalists and language speakers in the newly founded states of [[Romania]] (1859–78) and Serbia.

Hungary's leaders were generally less willing than their Austrian counterparts to share power with their subject minorities, but they granted a large measure of autonomy to [[Triune Kingdom of Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia|Croatia]] in 1868. To some extent, they modelled their relation to that kingdom on their own compromise with Austria of the previous year. In spite of nominal autonomy, the Croatian government was an economic and administrative part of Hungary, which the Croatians resented. In the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|triune kingdom of Croatia]] and Bosnia and Herzegovina many advocated the idea of a [[Trialism in Austria-Hungary|trialist Austro-Hungaro-Croatian]] monarchy among the supporters of the idea where [[Archduke Leopold Salvator of Austria|Archduke Leopold Salvator]],  [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] and emperor and king [[Charles I of Austria|Charles I. (IV.)]] who during his short reign supported the trialist idea only to be vetoed by the Hungarian government and Count [[Istvan Tisza]]. The count finally signed the trialist proclamation after heavy pressure from the king on 23 October 1918. one day after the king.&lt;ref name=&quot;Budisavljević&quot;&gt;Budisavljević, Srđan, ''Stvaranje-Države-SHS, Creaton of the state of SHS'', Zagreb, 1958, p. 132.-133.&lt;/ref&gt;

Language was one of the most contentious issues in Austro-Hungarian politics. All governments faced difficult and divisive hurdles in deciding on the languages of government and of instruction. The minorities sought the widest opportunities for education in their own languages, as well as in the &quot;dominant&quot; languages—Hungarian and German. By the &quot;Ordinance of 5 April 1897&quot;, the Austrian Prime Minister [[Count Kasimir Felix Badeni]] gave Czech equal standing with German in the internal government of [[Bohemia]]; this led to a crisis because of nationalist German agitation throughout the empire. The Crown dismissed Badeni.

The Hungarian Minority Act of 1868 gave the minorities (Slovaks, Romanians, Serbs, et al.) individual (but not also communal) rights to use their language in offices, schools (although in practice often only in those founded by them and not by the state), courts and municipalities (if 20% of the deputies demanded it). From June 1907, all public and [[private school]]s in Hungary were obliged to ensure that [[Magyarization|after the fourth grade, the pupils could express themselves fluently in Hungarian]]. This led to the closing of several minority schools, devoted mostly to the Slovak and Rusyn languages.

The two kingdoms sometimes divided their [[sphere of influence|spheres of influence]]. According to [[Misha Glenny]] in his book, ''The Balkans, 1804–1999'', the Austrians responded to Hungarian support of Czechs by supporting the Croatian national movement in [[Zagreb]].

In recognition that he reigned in a multi-ethnic country, Emperor Franz Joseph spoke (and used) German, Hungarian and Czech fluently, and Polish and Italian to some degree.

In 1914, Jews in the empire numbered about two million;{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} their position was ambiguous. [[Antisemitism|Antisemitic]] parties and movements existed, but the governments of Vienna and Budapest did not initiate [[pogroms]] or implement official antisemitic policies.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} They feared that such [[ethnic violence]] could ignite other [[minority group|ethnic minorities]] and escalate out of control. The antisemitic parties remained on the periphery of the political sphere due to their low popularity among voters in the parliamentary elections.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

In that period, the majority of Jews in Austria-Hungary lived in small towns (''[[shtetls]]'') in [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] and rural areas in Hungary and Bohemia, although there were large communities in Vienna, Budapest, Prague and other large cities. Of the pre-World War military forces of the major European powers, the Austro-Hungarian army was almost alone in its regular promotion of Jews to positions of command.{{sfn|Rothenberg|1976|p=118}} While the Jewish population of the lands of the Dual Monarchy was about five percent, Jews made up nearly eighteen percent of the reserve officer corps.{{sfn|Rothenberg|1976|p=128}} Thanks to the constitution's modern laws and to the benevolence of emperor Franz Joseph, the Austrian Jews came to regard the era of Austria-Hungary as a golden era of their history.&lt;ref&gt;David S. Wyman,Charles H. Rosenzveig: ''The World Reacts to the Holocaust''. (page: 474)&lt;/ref&gt; By 1910 about 900,000 Jews made up approximately 5 percent of the population of Hungary and about 23 percent of Budapest's citizenry. Jews accounted for 54 percent of commercial business owners, 85 percent of financial institution directors and owners, and 62 percent of all employees in commerce&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/hungary/25.htm |title=Hungary - Social Changes |publisher=Countrystudies.us |accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linguistic distribution===
In the Austrian Empire, 36.8% of the total population spoke German as a mother tongue, and more than 71% of the inhabitants spoke some German. In the Kingdom of Hungary, 54.4% of the total population spoke Hungarian as a mother tongue. Not counting autonomous Croatia, more than 64% of the inhabitants of the Hungarian Kingdom spoke Hungarian.

[[File:KuK Infanterie 1898.jpg|thumb|k.u.k. [[Infantry]] 1898]]
The military system of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy was similar in both states, and rested since 1868 upon the principle of the universal and personal obligation of the citizen to bear arms. Its military force was composed of the [[common army]] (''k. und k.''); the special armies, namely the [[Austrian Landwehr]], and the [[Hungarian Honved]], which were separate national institutions, and the [[Landsturm]] or levy-en masse. As stated above, the common army stood under the administration of the joint minister of war, while the special armies were under the administration of the respective ministries of national defence. The yearly contingent of recruits for the army was fixed by the military bills voted on by the Austrian and Hungarian parliaments, and was generally determined on the basis of the population, according to the last census returns. It amounted in 1905 to 103,100 men, of which Austria furnished 59,211 men, and Hungary 43,889. Besides 10,000 men were annually allotted to the Austrian Landwehr, and 12,500 to the Hungarian Honved. The term of service was two years (three years in the cavalry) with the colours, seven or eight in the reserve and two in the Landwehr; in the case of men not drafted to the active army the same total period of service was spent in various special reserves.

The common minister of war was the head for the administration of all military affairs, except those of the Austrian Landwehr and of the Hungarian Honved, which were committed to the ministries for national defence of the two respective states. But the supreme command of the army was vested in the monarch, who had the power to take all measures regarding the whole army.&lt;ref name=ah1911/&gt;

The Austro-Hungarian navy was mainly a coast defence force, and also included a flotilla of monitors for the Danube. It was administered by the naval department of the ministry of war.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Preludes: Bosnia and Herzegovina===
{{Main|Bosnia and Herzegovina in Austria-Hungary}}

Russian [[Pan-Slavic]] organizations sent aid to the Balkan rebels and so pressured the tsar's government that Russia declared war on the Ottoman Empire in 1877 in the name of protecting Orthodox Christians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kann 1974&quot;/&gt; Unable to mediate between the Ottoman Empire and Russia over the control of Serbia, Austria-Hungary declared neutrality when the conflict between the two powers escalated into a [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|war]]. With help from Romania and Greece, Russia defeated the Ottomans and by the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] created a large pro-Russian Bulgaria. This treaty sparked an international uproar that almost resulted in a general European war. Austria-Hungary and Britain feared that an enlarged Bulgaria would become a Russian satellite that would enable the tsar to dominate the Balkans. [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British prime minister]] Benjamin Disraeli moved warships into position against Russia to halt the advance of Russian influence in the eastern Mediterranean so close to Britain's route through the [[Suez Canal]].&lt;ref&gt;Rene Albrecht-Carrie, ''A Diplomatic History of Europe Since the Congress of Vienna'' (1973) CH 6&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Archduke Eugen Bosniaks.jpg|thumb|left|230px|[[Bosniaks]] were [[Bosnian-Herzegovinian Infantry|recruited into elite units]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] as early as 1879 and were commended for their bravery in service of the Austrian emperor, winning more medals than any other unit. The jaunty military march ''[[Die Bosniaken Kommen (March)|Die Bosniaken Kommen]]'' was composed in their honor by [[Eduard Wagnes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.se/books?id=XkLDVyYZPBYC&amp;pg=PA264| title=The Enemy at the Gate: Habsburgs, Ottomans and the Battle for Europe, p. 264 |first=Andrew |last=Wheatcroft}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[Congress of Berlin]] rolled back the Russian victory by partitioning the large Bulgarian state that Russia had carved out of Ottoman territory and denying any part of Bulgaria full independence from the Ottomans. Austria occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina as a way of gaining clout in the Balkans. Serbia and Montenegro became fully independent. Nonetheless the Balkans remained a site of political unrest with teeming ambition for independence and great power rivalries. At the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878 [[Gyula Andrássy]] (Minister of Foreign Affairs) managed to force Russia to retreat from further demands in the Balkans. As a result, [[Greater Bulgaria]] was broken up and Serbian independence was guaranteed.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;/&gt; In that year, with Britain's support, Austria-Hungary stationed troops in Bosnia to prevent the Russians from expanding into nearby Serbia. In another measure to keep the Russians out of the Balkans Austria-Hungary formed an alliance, the Mediterranean Entente, with Britain and Italy in 1887 and concluded mutual defence pacts with Germany in 1879 and Romania in 1883 against a possible Russian attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;webcitation&quot;/&gt; Following the Congress of Berlin the European powers attempted to guarantee stability through a complex series of alliances and treaties.

Anxious about Balkan instability and Russian aggression, and to counter French interests in Europe, Austria-Hungary forged a [[defensive alliance]] with Germany in October 1879 and in May 1882. In October 1882 Italy joined this partnership in the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] largely because of Italy's imperial rivalries with France. Tensions between Russia and Austria-Hungary remained high so [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] replaced the [[League of the Three Emperors]] with the [[Reinsurance Treaty]] with Russia to keep the Habsburgs from recklessly starting a war over Pan-Slavism.&lt;ref&gt;Rene Albrecht-Carrie, ''A Diplomatic History of Europe Since the Congress of Vienna'' (1973) pp&amp;nbsp;201–14&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Sandžak|Sandžak- Raška]] region was under Austro-Hungarian occupation between 1878 and 1909, when it was ceded to the [[Ottoman Empire]], before being ultimately divided between kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mount HolyOak&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/boshtml/bos128.htm |title=The Austrian Occupation of Novibazar, 1878–1909 |publisher=Mount HolyOak |accessdate=24 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the heels of the Great Balkan Crisis, Austro-Hungarian forces occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina in August 1878 and the monarchy eventually [[Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina in October 1908]] as a common holding of Cis- and Transleithania under the control of the [[finance minister|Imperial &amp; Royal finance ministry]] rather than attaching it to either territorial government. This occupation was a response to Russia's advances into [[Bessarabia]]. The annexation in 1908 led some in Vienna to contemplate combining Bosnia and Herzegovina with Croatia to form a third Slavic component of the Empire. The deaths of Franz Joseph's brother, [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian]] (1867), and his only son, [[Rudolf, Crown Prince of Austria|Rudolf]] made the Emperor's nephew, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]], heir to the throne. The Archduke was rumoured to have been an advocate for this trialism as a means to limit the power of the Hungarian aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Rene Albrecht-Carrie, ''A Diplomatic History of Europe Since the Congress of Vienna'' (1973) ch 8&lt;/ref&gt;

====The status of Bosnia-Herzegovina====
A proclamation issued on the occasion of its annexation to the Habsburg Monarchy in 1908 promised these lands constitutional institutions, which should secure to their inhabitants full civil rights and a share in the management of their own affairs by means of a local representative assembly. In performance of this promise a constitution was promulgated in 1910. This included a Territorial Statute (Landesstatut) with the setting up of a Territorial Diet, regulations for the election and procedure of the Diet, a law of associations, a law of public meetings, and a law dealing with the district councils. According to this statute Bosnia-Herzegovina formed a single administrative territory under the responsible direction and supervision of the Ministry of Finance of the Dual Monarchy in Vienna. The administration of the country, together with the carrying out of the laws, devolved upon the Territorial Government in Sarajevo, which was subordinate and responsible to the Common Ministry of Finance. The existing judicial and administrative authorities of the Territory retained their previous organization and functions. That statute introduced the modern rights and laws in Bosnia – Herzegovina, and it guaranteed generally the civil rights of the inhabitants of the Territory, namely citizenship, personal liberty, protection by the competent judicial authorities, liberty of creed and conscience, preservation of the national individuality and language, freedom of speech, freedom of learning and education, inviolability of the domicile, secrecy of posts and telegraphs, inviolability of property, the right of petition, and finally the right of holding meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Rene Albrecht-Carrie, ''A Diplomatic History of Europe Since the Congress of Vienna'' (1973) pp&amp;nbsp;259–72&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bosnian Diet (Sabor) set up consisted of a single Chamber, elected on the principle of the representation of interests. It numbered 92 members. Of these 20 consisted of representatives of all the religious confessions, the president of the Supreme Court, the president of the Chamber of Advocates, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, and the mayor of Sarajevo. In addition to these were 72 deputies, elected by three curiae or electoral groups. The first curia included the large landowners, the highest taxpayers, and people who had reached a certain standard of education without regard to the amount they paid in taxes. To the second curia belonged inhabitants of the towns not qualified to vote in the first; to the third, country dwellers disqualified in the same way. With this curial system was combined the grouping of the mandates and of the electors according to the three dominant creeds (Catholic, Serbian Orthodox, Muslim). To the adherents of other creeds the right was conceded of voting with one or other of the religious electoral bodies within the curia to which they belonged.&lt;ref name=b1911/&gt;

====Sarajevo assassination====
{{Main|Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand}}
On 28 June 1914, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] visited the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] capital, [[Sarajevo]]. A group of six assassins ([[Cvjetko Popović]], [[Gavrilo Princip]], [[Muhamed Mehmedbašić]], [[Nedeljko Čabrinović]], [[Trifko Grabež]], [[Vaso Čubrilović]]) from the nationalist group [[Young Bosnia|Mlada Bosna]], supplied by the [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Black Hand]], had gathered on the street where the Archduke's motorcade would pass. Čabrinović threw a [[Hand grenade|grenade]] at the car, but missed. It injured some people nearby, and Franz Ferdinand's convoy could carry on. The other assassins failed to act as the cars drove past them quickly. About an hour later, when Franz Ferdinand was returning from a visit at the Sarajevo Hospital, the convoy took a wrong turn into a street where [[Gavrilo Princip]] by coincidence stood. With a pistol, Princip shot and killed Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie. The reaction among the Austrian people was mild, almost indifferent. As historian Z.A.B. Zeman later wrote, &quot;the event almost failed to make any impression whatsoever. On Sunday and Monday [June 28 and 29], the crowds in Vienna listened to music and drank wine, as if nothing had happened.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

====Decision for war====
{{Main|Causes of World War I}}
While the empire's military spending had not even doubled since the 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]], Germany's spending had risen fivefold, and the British, Russian, and French expenditures threefold. The empire had lost ethnic Italian areas to [[Piedmont]] because of nationalist movements that had swept through Italy, and many Austro-Hungarians perceived as imminent the threat of losing to [[Serbia]] the southern territories inhabited by Slavs. Serbia had recently gained considerable territory in the [[Second Balkan War]] of 1913, causing much distress in government circles in Vienna and Budapest. Former ambassador and foreign minister Count [[Alois Aehrenthal]] had assumed that any future war would be in the Balkan region.

Hungarian prime minister and political scientist [[István Tisza]] opposed the expansion of the empire on the Balkan (see [[Bosnian crisis]] in 1908), because &quot;the Dual Monarchy already had too many Slavs&quot;, which would further threaten the integrity of the Dual Monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;William Jannen: Lions of July: Prelude to War, 1914 - PAGE:456&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1914, Tisza wrote a memorandum to Emperor Francis Joseph. His letter had strongly apocalyptic predictive and embittered tone. He used exactly the hitherto unknown &quot;Weltkrieg&quot; (means World War) phrase in his letter.
&quot;It is my firm conviction that Germany's two neighbors [Russia and France] are carefully proceeding with military preparations, but will not start the war so long as they have not attained a grouping of the Balkan states against us that confronts the monarchy with an attack from three sides and pins down the majority of our forces on our eastern and southern front.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;David G. Herrmann: The Arming of Europe and the Making of the First World War - PAGE: 211 , Princeton University Press, (1997) ISBN 9780691015958&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day of the assassination of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]], Tisza immediately traveled to [[Vienna]] where he met Minister of Foreign Affairs Count Berchtold and Army Commander Conrad von Hötzendorf. They proposed to solve the dispute with arms, attacking [[Serbia]]. Tisza proposed to give the government of Serbia time to take a stand as to whether it was involved in the organisation of the murder and proposed a peaceful resolution, arguing that the international situation would settle soon. Returning to Budapest, he wrote to [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] saying he would not take any responsibility for the armed conflict because there was no proof that Serbia had plotted the assassination. Tisza opposed a war with Serbia, stating (correctly, as it turned out) that any war with the Serbs was bound to trigger a war with Russia and hence a general European war.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Fritz: Germany’s Aims in the First World War, New York, W.W. Norton, 1967, ISBN 978-0-393-09798-6 (PAGE: 52)&lt;/ref&gt; He did not trust in the Italian alliance, due to the political aftermath of the [[Second Italian War of Independence]]. He thought that even a successful Austro-Hungarian war would be disastrous for the integrity of Kingdom of Hungary, where Hungary would be the next victim of Austrian politics. After a successful war against Serbia, Tisza adumbrated a possible Austrian military attack against the Kingdom of Hungary, where the Austrians want to break up the territory of Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/tisza.htm Michael Duffy: Who's Who - Count Istvan Tisza de Boros-Jeno]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members of the government, such as [[Count Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf]], had wanted to confront the resurgent Serbian nation for some years in a preventive war, but the Emperor, 84 years old and an enemy of all adventures, disapproved.

The foreign ministry of Austro-Hungarian Empire sent ambassador [[László Szőgyény-Marich, Jr.|László Szőgyény]] to Potsdam, where he inquired about the standpoint of the German Emperor on 5 July.
Szőgyény described what happened in a secret report to Vienna later that day:

{{Quotation|&quot;I presented His Majesty [Wilhelm] with [Franz Joseph’s] letter and the attached memorandum. The Kaiser read both papers quite carefully in my presence. First, His Majesty assured me that he had expected us to take firm action against Serbia, but he had to concede that, as a result of the conflicts facing [Franz Joseph], he needed to take into account a serious complication in Europe, which is why he did not wish to give any definite answer prior to consultations with the chancellor....

When, after our déjeuner, I once again emphasized the gravity of the situation, His Majesty authorized me to report to [Franz Joseph] that in this case, too, we could count on Germany’s full support. As mentioned, he first had to consult with the chancellor, but he did not have the slightest doubt that Herr von Bethmann Hollweg would fully agree with him, particularly with regard to action on our part against Serbia. In his [Wilhelm’s] opinion, though, there was no need to wait patiently before taking action.
The Kaiser said that Russia’s stance would always be a hostile one, but he had been prepared for this for many years, and even if war broke out between Austria-Hungary and Russia, we could rest assured that Germany would take our side, in line with its customary loyalty. According to the Kaiser, as things stood now, Russia was not at all ready for war. It would certainly have to think hard before making a call to arms.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Source: Ladislaus Count von Szögyény-Marich (Berlin) to Leopold Count von Berchtold (July 5, 1914), in Ludwig Bittner, et. al., eds., Österreich-Ungarns Aussenpolitik von der Bosnischen Krise 1908 bis zum Kriegsausbruch 1914 [Austria-Hungary’s Foreign Policy prior to the Bosnian Crisis of 1908 up to the Outbreak of War in 1914]. 8 vols, Vienna, 1930, vol. 8, no. 10,058.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

But now the leaders of Austria-Hungary, especially General [[Leopold Graf Berchtold|Count Leopold von Berchtold]], backed by its ally Germany, decided to confront Serbia militarily before it could incite a revolt; using the assassination as an excuse, they presented a list of ten demands called the [[July Ultimatum]],&lt;ref name=&quot;firstworldwar&quot;/&gt; expecting Serbia would never accept. When Serbia accepted nine of the ten demands but only partially accepted the remaining one, Austria-Hungary declared war. Franz Joseph I finally followed the urgent counsel of his top advisers.

Over the course of July and August 1914, these events caused the start of [[World War I]], as Russia mobilized in support of Serbia, setting off a series of counter-mobilizations. Italy initially remained neutral, although it had an alliance with Austria-Hungary. In 1915, it switched to the side of the [[Triple Entente|Entente powers]], hoping to gain territory from its former ally.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Clark (historian)|Christopher Clark]], ''The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914'' pp. 420–30 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Main events===
General von Hötzendorf was the Chief of the Austro-Hungarian General Staff. Franz Joseph I, who was much too old to command the army, appointed Archduke Friedrich von Österreich-Teschen as Supreme Army Commander (Armeeoberkommandant), but asked him to give Von Hötzendorf freedom to take any decisions. The latter remained in effective command of the military forces until Emperor [[Charles I of Austria|Karl I]] took the supreme command himself in late 1916 and dismissed Conrad von Hötzendorf in 1917.

====Serbian front====

At the start of the war, the army was divided in two: the smaller part attacked Serbia while the larger part fought against the formidable Russian army. The invasion of Serbia in 1914 was a disaster: by the end of the year, the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] had taken no territory but had lost 227,000 out of a total force of 450,000 men (see [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)]]). However in autumn 1915, the Serbian Army was defeated by the Central Powers, which led to the occupation of Serbia. Near the end of 1915, in a massive rescue operation involving more than 1,000 trips made by Italian, French and British steamers, 260,000 Serb soldiers were transported to [[Corfu]], where they waited for the chance of the victory of Allied Powers to reclaim their country. Corfu hosted the Serbian government in exile after the collapse of Serbia, and served as a supply base to the Greek front. In April 1916 a large number of Serbian troops were transported in British and French naval vessels from Corfu to mainland Greece. The contingent numbering over 120,000 relieved a much smaller army at the [[Thessaloniki]] front and fought alongside British and French troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;history1&quot;/&gt;

====Russian front====
[[File:Szturm Twierdzy Przemysl A. Ritter von Meissl.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Siege of Przemyśl]] in 1915]]
On the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern front]], the war started out equally poorly. The Austro-Hungarian Army was defeated at the [[Battle of Galicia|Battle of Lemberg]] and the great fortress city of [[Siege of Przemyśl|Przemyśl was besieged]] and fell in March 1915. The [[Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive]] started as a minor German offensive to relieve the pressure of the Russian numerical superiority on the Austro-Hungarians, but the cooperation of the Central Powers resulted in huge Russian losses and the total collapse of the Russian lines, and their {{convert|100|km|0|sp=us|abbr=on}} long retreat into Russia. The Russian Third Army perished. In summer 1915, the Austro-Hungarian Army, under a unified command with the Germans, participated in the successful [[Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive]]. From June 1916, the Russians focused their attacks on the Austro-Hungarian army in the [[Brusilov Offensive]], recognizing the numerical inferiority of the Austro-Hungarian army. By the end of September 1916, Austria-Hungary mobilized and concentrated new divisions, and the successful Russian advance was halted and slowly repelled; but the Austrian armies took heavy losses (about 1 million men) and never recovered. The [[Battle of Zborov (1917)]] was the first significant action of the [[Czechoslovak Legions]], who fought for the independence of Czechoslovakia against the Austro-Hungarian army. However the huge losses in men and material inflicted on the Russians during the offensive contributed greatly to their two revolutions of 1917, and it caused an economic crash in the Russian Empire.

====Italian front====

In May 1915, [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] attacked Austria-Hungary. Italy was the only military opponent of the Empire which had a similar degree of industrialization and economic level; moreover, her army was numerous (~1,000,000 men were immediately fielded), but suffered poor leadership, training and organization. [[Chief of Staff]] [[Luigi Cadorna]] marched his army towards the [[Isonzo]] river, hoping to seize [[Ljubljana]], and to eventually threaten [[Vienna]]. However, the Italians were halted on the river, where [[Battles of the Isonzo|four battles]] took place over five months (23 June - 2 December 1915). The fight was extremely bloody and exhausting for both the contenders.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Schindler, ''Isonzo: The Forgotten Sacrifice of the Great War'' (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 May 1916, the Austrian Chief of Staff [[Conrad von Hötzendorf]] launched the ''[[Battle of Asiago|Strafexpedition]]'' (&quot;[[punitive expedition]]&quot;): the Austrians broke through the opposing front and occupied the [[Asiago plateau]]. The Italians managed to resist and in a counteroffensive, seized [[Gorizia]] on 9 August. Nonetheless, they had to stop on the [[Carso]], a few kilometres away from the border. At this point, several months of indecisive [[trench warfare]] (analogous to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western front]] one) ensued. As the [[Russian Empire]] collapsed as a result of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] and Russians ended their involvement in the war, Germans and Austrians were able to move on the Western and Southern fronts much manpower from the erstwhile Eastern fighting. On 24 October 1917, Austrians (now enjoying decisive German support) attacked at [[Battle of Caporetto|Caporetto]] using new infiltration tactics; although they advanced more than {{convert|100|km|2|sp=us|abbr=on}} in the direction of [[Venice]] and gained considerable supplies, they were halted and could not cross the [[Piave (river)|Piave]] river. Italy, although suffering massive casualties, recovered from the blow: a [[coalition government]] under [[Vittorio Emanuele Orlando]] was formed. Italy also enjoyed support by the Entente powers: by 1918, large amounts of war materials and a few auxiliary American, British, and French divisions arrived in the Italian battle zone.&lt;ref&gt;Gaetano V. Cavallaro (2010). The Beginning of Futility: Diplomatic, Political, Military and Naval Events on the Austro-Italian Front in the First World War 1914–1917 I. p. 339. ISBN 978-1-4010-8426-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Cadorna was replaced by General [[Armando Diaz]]; under his command, the Italians retook the initiative and won the decisive [[Battle of the Piave river]] (15–23 June 1918), in which some 60,000 Austrian and 43,000 Italian soldiers were killed. The multiethnic Austro-Hungarian Empire started to disintegrate, leaving its army alone on the battlefields. The final battle was at [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]]; after 4 days of stiff resistance, Italian troops crossed the Piave River, and after losing 90,000 men the defeated Austrian troops retreated in disarray pursued by the Italians. The ''[[Regio Esercito]]'' captured 428,000 Austrian-Hungarian soldiers,{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} 24 of whom were generals,&lt;ref&gt;Pier Paolo Cervone, ''Vittorio Veneto, l'ultima battaglia'', Milano, Mursia, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; 5,600 cannons and mortars, 4,000 [[Heavy machine guns|machine guns]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Indro Montanelli]]; Mario Cervi, ''Due secoli di guerre'', VII, Novara, Editoriale Nuova, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; The military breakdown also marked the start of the rebellion for the numerous ethnicities who made up the multiethnic Empire, as they refused to keep on fighting for a cause which now appeared senseless. These events marked the end of Austria-Hungary, which collapsed on 31 October 1918. The armistice was signed at [[Armistice of Villa Giusti|Villa Giusti]] on 3 November.

====Romanian front====

On 27 August 1916, [[Romania]] proclaimed war against Austria-Hungary. The Romanian army crossed the borders of Eastern Hungary (Transylvania). By November 1916, the Central Powers had defeated the Romanian army and occupied the southern and eastern parts of Romania. On 6 December the Central Powers captured Bucharest, the Romanian capital city.

===Role of Hungary===
[[File:Csíkpálfalva2.JPG|thumb|200px|right|War memorial in [[Păuleni-Ciuc]], Romania.]]

Austria-Hungary held on for years, as the Hungarian half provided sufficient supplies for the military to continue to wage war.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;/&gt; This was shown in a transition of power after which the Hungarian prime minister, Count [[István Tisza]], and foreign minister, Count [[István Burián]], had decisive influence over the internal and external affairs of the monarchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;/&gt; By late 1916, food supply from Hungary became intermittent and the government sought an armistice with the Entente powers. However, this failed as Britain and France no longer had any regard for the integrity of the empire because of Austro-Hungarian support for Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;/&gt;

===Analysis of defeat===

The setbacks that the Austrian army suffered in 1914 and 1915 can be attributed to a large extent to Austria-Hungary becoming a military satellite of [[Imperial Germany]] from the first day of the war. They were made worse by the incompetence of the Austrian high command.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;/&gt; After attacking Serbia, its forces soon had to be withdrawn to protect its eastern frontier against Russia's invasion, while German units were engaged in fighting on [[Western Front (World War I)|the Western Front]]. This resulted in a greater than expected loss of men in the invasion of Serbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;/&gt; Furthermore it became evident that the Austrian high command had had no plans for a possible continental war and that the army and navy were also ill-equipped to handle such a conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;/&gt;

From 1916, the Austro-Hungarian war effort became more and more subordinated to the direction of German planners. The Austrians viewed the [[German Army (German Empire)|German army]] favorably, on the other hand by 1916 the general belief in Germany was that it was &quot;shackled to a corpse&quot;. The operational capability of the Austro-Hungarian army was seriously affected by supply shortages, low morale and a high casualty rate, and by the army's composition of multiple ethnicities with different languages and customs.

The last two successes for the Austrians, the [[Romania during World War I|Romanian Offensive]] and the [[Battle of Caporetto|Caporetto Offensive]], were German-assisted operations. As the Dual Monarchy became more politically unstable, it became more and more dependent on German assistance. The majority of its people, other than Hungarians and German Austrians, became increasingly restless.

In 1917, the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern front]] of the Allied (Entente) Powers completely collapsed. The Austro-Hungarian Empire then withdrew from all defeated countries. Despite great eastern successes, Germany suffered complete defeat in the more decisive western front. By 1918, the economic situation had deteriorated. Leftist and pacifist political movements organized strikes in factories, and uprisings in the army had become commonplace. During the Italian battles, the Czechoslovaks and Southern Slavs declared their independence. On 31 October Hungary ended the personal union officially dissolving the Austro-Hungarian state. At the last Italian offensive Austro-Hungarian Army took to the field without any food and munition supply, and fought without any political supports for a ''de facto'' non-existent empire. On the end of the decisive joint Italian, British and French [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto|offensive at Vittorio Veneto]], the disintegrated Austria-Hungary signed a general armistice in [[Padua]] on 3 November 1918.

==Dissolution==
In the autumn of 1918, the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy collapsed. In the capital cities of Vienna and Budapest, the leftist and liberal movements and politicians (the opposition parties) strengthened and supported the [[separatism]] of ethnic minorities. These leftist or left-liberal pro-Entente maverick parties opposed the monarchy as a [[form of government]] and considered themselves internationalist rather than patriotic. Eventually, the German defeat and the minor revolutions in Vienna and Budapest gave political power to the left/liberal political parties. As it became apparent that the Allied powers of the [[British Empire]], France, Italy and the United States would win World War I, nationalist movements, which had previously been calling for a greater degree of autonomy for various areas, started pressing for full independence.

As one of his [[Fourteen Points]], [[President of the United States|U.S. president]] [[Woodrow Wilson]] demanded that the nationalities of the empire have the &quot;freest opportunity to autonomous development&quot;. In response, Emperor-King, [[Charles I of Austria|Charles]] (Charles I in Austria and Károly IV in Hungary), who had succeeded Francis Joseph in 1916, agreed to reconvene the imperial parliament in 1917 and allow the creation of a [[confederation]] with each national group exercising [[self-governance]]. However the leaders of these national groups no longer trusted Vienna and were now determined to get independence.

[[File:Poprava vůdců rumburské vzpoury 1918.jpg|thumb|240px|The revolt of ethnic [[Czechs|Czech]] units in Austria in May 1918 was brutally suppressed. It was considered as [[mutiny]] by the code of [[military justice]].]]

On 14 October 1918, Foreign Minister [[István Burián|Baron István Burián von Rajecz]]&lt;ref name=&quot;mfa&quot;/&gt; asked for an armistice based on the Fourteen Points. In an apparent attempt to demonstrate [[good faith]], Charles issued a proclamation (&quot;Imperial Manifesto of 16 October 1918&quot;) two days later which would have significantly altered the structure of the Austrian half of the monarchy. The Polish majority regions of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Lodomeria]] were to be granted the option of seceding from the empire, and it was understood that they would join their ethnic brethren in Russia and Germany in resurrecting a Polish state. The rest of [[Cisleithania]] was transformed into a federal union composed of four parts—German, Czech, South Slav and Ukrainian. Each of these was to be governed by a national council that would negotiate the future of the empire with Vienna, and Trieste was to receive a special status. No such proclamation could be issued in Hungary, where Hungarian aristocrats still believed they could subdue other nationalities and maintain the &quot;Holy Kingdom of St. Stephen&quot;.

It was a dead letter. Four days later, on 18 October [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Robert Lansing]] replied that the Allies were now committed to the causes of the Czechs, Slovaks and South Slavs. Therefore, Lansing said, autonomy for the nationalities&amp;nbsp;– the tenth of the Fourteen Points&amp;nbsp;– was no longer enough and Washington could not deal on the basis of the Fourteen Points any more. In fact, a [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak provisional government]] had joined the Allies on 14 October. The South Slavs in both halves of the empire had already declared in favor of uniting with Serbia in a large South Slav state by way of the 1917 [[Corfu Declaration]] signed by members of the [[Yugoslav Committee]].

The Lansing note was, in effect, the death certificate of Austria-Hungary. The national councils had already begun acting more or less as provisional governments of independent countries. With defeat in the war imminent after the Italian offensive in the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]] on 24 October, Czech politicians peacefully took over command in Prague on 28 October (later declared the birthday of Czechoslovakia) and followed up in other major cities in the next few days. On 30 October, the Slovaks followed in [[Martin, Slovakia|Martin]]. The Croatians began ignoring orders from Budapest in early October. On 29 October, the Slavs in both portions of what remained of the empire declared their independence. The South Slavs formed the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] as a prelude to uniting with Serbia, while the Czechs and Slovaks formally proclaimed the establishment of Czechoslovakia as an independent state. Charles' last Hungarian prime minister, [[Mihály Károlyi]], terminated the personal union with Austria by 31 October, officially dissolving the Austro-Hungarian state. By the end of October, there was nothing left of the Habsburg realm but its majority-German Danubian and Alpine provinces, and Charles' authority was being challenged even there by the German-Austrian state council.

===Consequences===
Charles' last Austrian prime minister, [[Heinrich Lammasch]], concluded that the Emperor-King was in an impossible situation, and persuaded Charles that the best course was to relinquish, at least temporarily, his exercise of sovereign authority. On 11 November, Charles issued a proclamation in which he recognized Austria's right to determine the form of the state and renounced the right to participate in Austrian affairs of state. He also released the officials in the Austrian portion of the empire from their oath of loyalty to him. Two days later, he issued a similar proclamation for Hungary. However, he did not abdicate, remaining available in the event the people of either state should recall him.

In Austria and Hungary, republics were declared at the end of the war in November. The [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] (between the victors of World War I and Austria) and the [[Treaty of Trianon]] (between the victors and Hungary) regulated the new borders of Austria and Hungary, leaving both as small landlocked states. The Allies assumed without question that the minority nationalities wanted to leave Austria and Hungary, and also allowed them to annex significant blocks of German- and Hungarian-speaking territory. As a result, the [[First Austrian Republic|Republic of Austria]] lost roughly 60% of the old [[Austrian Empire]]'s territory. It also had to drop [[Republic of German Austria|its plans for union with Germany]], as it was not allowed to unite with Germany without League approval. The [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1946)|restored Kingdom of Hungary]], which had replaced the republican government in 1920, lost roughly 72% of the pre-war territory of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].

The decisions of the nations of the former Austria-Hungary and of the victors of the Great War, contained in the heavily one-sided treaties, had devastating political and economic effects. The previously rapid [[economic growth]] of the Dual Monarchy ground to a halt because the new borders became major economic barriers. All the formerly well established industries were designed to satisfy the needs of an extensive realm. As a result, the emerging countries were forced to make considerable sacrifices to transform their economies. The treaties created major political unease. As a result of these economic difficulties, extremist movements gained strength; and there was no regional superpower in central Europe.

The new Austrian state was, at least on paper, on shakier ground than Hungary. While what was left of Austria had been a single unit for over 700 years, it was united only by loyalty to the Habsburgs. By comparison, Hungary had been a nation and a state for over 900 years. However, after a brief period of upheaval and the [[Allies of World War I|Allies']] foreclosure of union with Germany, Austria established itself as a federal republic. Despite the temporary ''[[Anschluss]]'' with [[Nazi Germany]], it still survives today. [[Adolf Hitler]] cited that all &quot;Germans&quot;, such as he and the other Austrians should be united with Germany, as all other Germans should.

Hungary, however, was severely disrupted by the loss of 72% of its territory, 64% of its population and most of its natural resources. The Hungarian Democratic Republic was short-lived and was temporarily replaced by the communist [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]]. [[Romania]]n troops ousted [[Béla Kun]] and his [[communist state|communist government]] during the [[Hungarian-Romanian War of 1919]]. In March 1920, a monarchist revival resulted in the restoration of the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. Royal powers were entrusted to a [[regent]], [[Miklós Horthy]], who had been the last commanding [[admiral]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Navy]] and had helped organize the counter-revolutionary forces. It was this government that signed the Treaty of Trianon under protest on 4 June 1920 at the [[Grand Trianon|Grand Trianon Palace]] in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], [[France]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Trianon, Treaty of|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1E1-TrianonTr.html|encyclopedia=[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]]|year=2009}}{{dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia of ww1&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Tucker| first = Spencer|author2=Priscilla Mary Roberts| title = Encyclopedia of World War I| url = http://books.google.com/?id=2YqjfHLyyj8C| edition = 1| year = 2005| publisher = ABC-CLIO| isbn = 978-1-85109-420-2| page = 1183| quote = Virtually the entire population of what remained of Hungary regarded the Treaty of Trianon as manifestly unfair, and agitation for revision began immediately. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March and again in October 1921, ill-prepared attempts by Charles to [[Charles I of Austria's attempts to retake the throne of Hungary|regain the throne in Budapest]] collapsed. The initially wavering Horthy, after receiving threats of intervention from the Allied Powers and neighboring countries, refused his cooperation. Subsequently, the British took custody of Charles and removed him and his family to the Portuguese island of [[Madeira]], where he died the following year.

====Successor states====
{{Main|Treaty of Trianon|Treaty of Saint Germain}}

The following [[successor state]]s were formed (entirely or in part) on the territory of the former Austria-Hungary:
*[[German Austria]] and [[First Austrian Republic]]
*[[Hungarian Democratic Republic]], [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]], and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Kingdom of Hungary]]
*[[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czecho-Slovakia]] (&quot;Czechoslovakia&quot; from 1920 to 1938)
*[[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] and [[Kingdom of Serbia]] (joined on 1 December 1918 to form the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], later [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]])
*[[Second Polish Republic]]
*[[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] (united with the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] through [[Act Zluky]], while its territory was fully overran by the [[Second Polish Republic]])
* Duchy of [[Bukovina|Bukowina]] and [[Transylvania]] united with the [[Kingdom of Romania]] ([[Union of Transylvania with Romania]])

Austro-Hungarian lands were also ceded to the [[Kingdom of Romania]] and the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]]. The [[Liechtenstein|Principality of Liechtenstein]], which had formerly looked to Vienna for protection, formed a customs and defense union with [[Switzerland]], and adopted the Swiss currency instead of the Austrian. In April 1919, [[Vorarlberg]]&amp;nbsp;– the westernmost province of Austria&amp;nbsp;– voted by a large majority to join Switzerland; however, both the Swiss and the Allies disregarded this result.

The following present-day countries and parts of countries were located within the boundaries of Austria-Hungary when the empire was dissolved:

'''[[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]]''' ('''[[Cisleithania]]'''):
*Austria (with the exception of [[Burgenland]])
*[[Czech Republic]] (with the exception of the [[Hlučín Region|Hlučínsko]] area)
*[[Slovenia]] (with the exception of [[Prekmurje]])
*Italy ([[Trentino]], [[South Tyrol]], parts of the [[province of Belluno]] and small portions of [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]])
*[[Croatia]] (Dalmatia, Istria)
*Poland (voivodeships of [[Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Lesser Poland]], [[Subcarpathian Voivodeship|Subcarpathia]], southernmost part of [[Silesian Voivodeship|Silesia]] (Bielsko and Cieszyn))
*[[Ukraine]] (oblasts of [[Lviv Oblast|Lviv]], [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast|Ivano-Frankivsk]], [[Ternopil Oblast|Ternopil]] (except its northern corner) and most of the oblast of [[Chernivtsi Oblast|Chernivtsi]])
*[[Romania]] (county of [[Suceava County|Suceava]])
*[[Montenegro]] (bay of [[Bay of Kotor|Boka Kotorska]], the coast and the immediate hinterland around the cities of [[Budva]], [[Petrovac (Montenegro)|Petrovac]] and [[Sutomore]])

'''[[Kingdom of Hungary]]''' ('''[[Transleithania]]'''):
*Hungary;
*[[Slovakia]]
*Austria ([[Burgenland]])
*[[Slovenia]] ([[Prekmurje]])
*[[Croatia]] ([[Slavonia]], [[Central Croatia]], southern parts of the pre-1918 [[Baranya County (former)|Baranya]] and [[Zala County (former)|Zala counties]]&amp;nbsp;– today's Croatian part of Baranja and [[Međimurje County|Međimurje county]])
*[[Ukraine]] (oblast of [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Zakarpattia]])

*[[Poland]] (Polish parts of [[Orava (region)|Orava]] and [[Spiš]])
*[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (the villages of Zavalje, Mali skočaj and Veliki skočaj including the immediate surrounding area west of the city of Bihać)

'''[[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Austro-Hungarian Condominium]]'''
*[[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]
*[[Montenegro]] ([[Sutorina]]&amp;nbsp;– western part of the Municipality of [[Herceg Novi|Herceg–Novi]] between present borders with Croatia (SW) and Bosnia and Herzegovina (NW), [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic coast]] (E) and the township of Igalo (NE))
*[[Serbia]] ([[Sandžak|Sandžak- Raška region]] Austro-Hungarian occupied since 1878 while formally part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] until 1912)

''Possessions of the [[Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]]''
*The empire was unable to gain and maintain large colonies owing to its geographical position. Its only possession outside of Europe was its [[Concessions in Tianjin#Austro-Hungarian concession (1901–1917)|concession in Tianjin]], [[China]], which it was granted in return for supporting the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] in suppressing the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. However although the city was only an Austro-Hungarian possession for 16 years, the Austro-Hungarians left their mark on that area of the city, in the form of architecture that still stands in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;information&quot;/&gt;
Other parts of Europe had been part of the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] monarchy once but had left it before its dissolution in 1918. Prominent examples are the regions of [[Lombardy]] and [[Veneto]] in Italy, [[Silesia]] in Poland, most of Belgium and [[Serbia]], and parts of northern Switzerland and southwestern Germany.
They persuaded the government to search out [[foreign direct investment|foreign investment]] to build up infrastructure such as railroads. Despite these measures, Austria-Hungary remained resolutely monarchist and authoritarian.

The public was drawn into foreign policy: the music halls and newspapers of England echoed a new [[jingoism]] or political sloganeering that throbbed with sentiments of war: &quot;We don't want to fight but by Jingo if we do / We've got the ships, we've got the men, We've got the money too.&quot; The other great powers, however, did not want a Europe-wide war and in 1878 they attempted to revive the [[concert of Europe]] by meeting at Berlin under the auspices of Bismarck, who was a calming presence on the diplomatic scene.

==Flags and heraldry==

===Flags===
{{See also|List of Austrian flags|Flag of Hungary}}
Although Austria-Hungary did not have a common [[national flag|flag]] (a &quot;national flag&quot; could not exist since both halves of the Dual Monarchy consisted of inhabitants of several nationalities), a common [[civil ensign]] (introduced in 1869) did exist. Until 1918, the k.u.k. War Fleet continued to carry the Austrian ensign it had used since 1786; and the regiments of the k.u.k. Army carried the double-eagle flags they had used before 1867, as they had a long history in many cases. New ensigns created in 1915 had not been implemented until 1918 due to the war. At state functions, in Austria black-yellow and in Hungary red-white-green were exposed.

The colours black-yellow were used as the flag of the Austrian part.

===Coat of arms===
{{See also|Coat of arms of Austria-Hungary}}
The [[double-headed eagle]] of the Habsburg-Lorraine dynasty was used as the [[Coat of arms of Austria-Hungary|coat of arms]] of the common institutions of Austria-Hungary between 1867 and 1915. In 1915, a new one was introduced, which combined the coat of arms of the two parts of the empire and that of the dynasty.
