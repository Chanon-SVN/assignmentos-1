'''All Souls' Day''' is a day of prayer for the dead, particularly but not exclusively one's relatives. In [[Western Christianity]] the annual celebration is now held on 2 November and is associated with [[All Saints' Day]] (1 November) and its vigil, [[Halloween]] (31 October).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bannatyne|first=Lesley Pratt|title=Halloween: An American Holiday, an American History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rNAXt9jLXWwC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Hallowmas+three+All+Souls+All+Saints&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5xCUUNSzKqq10QHo1YG4DA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Hallowmas%20three%20All%20Souls%20All%20Saints&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 November 2012|date=1 August 1998|publisher=Pelican Publishing|isbn=1565543467|page=12|quote=The Church brought its saints' celebrations to every new land it conquered.

This optional observance is an extension of All Saints' Day. While All Saints' is to remember all the saints, popular piety felt the need to distinguish between outstanding saints and those who are unknown in the wider fellowship of the church, especially family members and friends. It is also known as All Souls' Day. Many churches now commemorate all the faithful departed in the context of the All Saints' Day celebration.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the associated [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], it is celebrated several times during the year and is not associated with the month of November.

Beliefs and practices associated with All Souls' Day vary widely among Christian churches and denominations.

==Byzantine (Greek) Catholics and the Eastern Orthodox Churches==&lt;!-- [[Saturday of the dead]] redirects here --&gt;
Among [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Eastern Catholic|Byzantine (Greek) Catholics]], there are several All Souls' Days during the year. Most of these fall on Saturday, since [[Jesus]] lay in the [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb]] on [[Holy Saturday]]. These are referred to as '''Soul Saturdays.''. They occur on the following occasions:
*The Saturday of [[Paschal cycle#Pre-Lent|Meatfare Week]] (the second Saturday before [[Great Lent]])—the day before the Sunday of the Last Judgement
*The second Saturday of Great Lent
*The third Saturday of Great Lent
*The fourth Saturday of Great Lent
*[[Radonitsa]] (Monday or Tuesday after [[Thomas Sunday]])
*The Saturday before [[Pentecost]]
*Demetrius Saturday (the Saturday before the feast of [[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki]]—26 October) (In all of the [[Orthodox Church]] there is a commemoration of the dead on the Saturday before the feast of [[Saint Michael the Archangel]]—8 November, instead of the Demetrius Soul Saturday)

(In the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] there is also a commemoration of the dead on the Saturday closest to the Conception of [[St. John the Baptist]]—[[September 23 (Eastern Orthodox liturgics)|23 September]])

(In Slavic and Greek Churches, all of the Lenten Soul Saturdays are typically observed. In some of the Churches of the Eastern Mediterranean, Meatfare Saturday, Radonitsa and the Saturday before Pentecost are typically observed.)

In addition to the Sundays mentioned above, Saturdays throughout the year are days for general commemoration of all saints, and special hymns to all saints are chanted from the [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]], unless some greater [[Great Feasts|feast]] or [[saint]]'s commemoration occurs.

[[Prayer for the dead]] is a documented practice in Judaism and in early Christianity. The setting aside of a particular day for praying not for certain named individuals but for whole classes of the departed or for the dead in general cannot be traced to the earliest Christian centuries, but was well established by the end of the first millennium. Prayers for the deceased members of Benedictine monasteries were offered in the week after Pentecost and the practice of praying for the dead at a date near Pentecost was also followed in Spain in the 7th century. Other dates chosen were Epiphany and the anniversary of the death of some well-known saint, as shown by evidence from the beginning of the 9th century. By about 980, 1 October was an established date in Germany. The 11th century saw the introduction of a liturgical commemoration in diocesan calendars. In Milan the date was 16 October until changed in the second half of the 16th century to 2 November. This date, the day after [[All Saints' Day]], was that which Saint [[Odilo of Cluny]] chose in the 11th century for all the monasteries dependent on the [[Abbey of Cluny]]. From these the 2 November custom spread to other Benedictine monasteries and thence to the Western Church in general.&lt;ref name=ZENIT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/all-souls-commemoration|title=Edward McNamara, &quot;All Souls' Commemoration&quot;|work=ZENIT - The World Seen From Rome|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official name of the celebration in the [[Roman Rite]] [[liturgy]] is &quot;'''The Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed'''&quot;.{{sfn|Mershman|1907}} In some countries the celebration is known as the '''[[Day of the Dead]]'''.

In the Roman Rite as revised in 1969, if 2 November falls on a Sunday, the Mass is of All Souls, but the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] is that of the Sunday. However, public celebration of Lauds and Vespers of the Dead with the people participating is permitted. A Sunday celebration of All Souls' Day is not anticipated on Saturday evening, as are a Sunday Mass and that of a solemnity or feast of the Lord that replaces a Sunday.  In countries where All Saints' Day is not a [[holy day of obligation]] attendance at an evening Mass of All Saints on Saturday 1 November satisfies the Sunday obligation.&lt;ref name=ZENIT/&gt; In every country, the formula of the Mass on that Saturday evening is that of the solemnity of All Saints, which outranks the Sunday of Ordinary Time whose Mass would normally be celebrated on that evening.&lt;ref name=ZENIT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Universal Norms on the Liturgical Year and the Calendar, &quot;Table of Liturgical Days&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2014, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops decided that for that year the Saturday evening (Sunday vigil) Mass in that country was to be that of All Souls.&lt;ref name=ZENIT14&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zenit.org/en/articles/all-souls-day-and-the-vigil-mass|title=Edward McNamara, &quot;All Souls' Day and the Vigil Mass&quot;|date=29 October 2014 |work=ZENIT - The World Seen From Rome|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In England and Wales, where holy days of obligation that fall on a Saturday are transferred to the following day, if 2 November is a Sunday, the solemnity of All Saints is transferred to that date, and All Souls Day is transferred to 3 November.&lt;ref name=ZENIT14/&gt; In pre-1970 forms of the Roman Rite, still observed by some, if All Souls Day falls on a Sunday, it is always transferred to 3 November.

==Anglican Communion==
The [[Church of England]]'s [[Thirty Nine Articles]] of 1563 rejected the &quot;Romish doctrine of Purgatory&quot;`, holding it to be &quot;contrary to the Word of God&quot;, and the practice of praying for the dead is denounced in the Homily &quot;On Prayer&quot; (part 3).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Neither let us dreame any more, that the soules of the dead are any thing at all holpen by our prayers: But as the Scripture teacheth us, let us thinke that the soule of man passing out of the body, goeth straight wayes either to heaven, or else to hell, whereof the one needeth no prayer, and the other is without redemption&quot; ([http://www.anglicanlibrary.org/homilies/bk2hom07.htm An Homilie or Sermon concerning Prayer], part 3)&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the [[English Reformation]] abolished the observance of All Souls' Day,&lt;ref name=Buchanan&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kGN2x9g_Gj0C&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=Buchanan+Anglicanism+%22All+Souls%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oBLnU5mBEebe7AaB8YCADg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Buchanan%20Anglicanism%20%22All%20Souls%22&amp;f=false|title=Colin Buchanan, ''The A to Z of Anglicanism'' (Scarecrow Press 2009 ISBN 978-0-81087008-6), p. 8|publisher=|accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; although many Anglican churches continued to be dedicated to All Souls, and many modern ones are also known by that name. In the 19th century observance of the day revived among Anglicans because of the influence of the [[Anglo-Catholic]] movement. Today it enjoys official recognition in the calendars of some provinces of the [[Anglican Communion]], generally on an optional level and avoiding terminology that would imply either recognition or rejection of the concept of [[purgatory]],&lt;ref name=Buchanan/&gt; on which there is wide divergence among Anglicans, ranging from outright rejection to support, as in the case of [[John Macquarrie]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osv.com/TodaysIssues/BioethicsandScience/Article/TabId/693/ArtMID/13736/ArticleID/6650/The-Anglican-view-of-purgatory.aspx Mannion, M. Francis, &quot;The Anglican View of Purgatory&quot; in ''Our Sunday Visitor'', 16 October 2011], accessed 10 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[C.S. Lewis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Prayer: Letters to Malcolm|last=Lewis|first=C.S.|isbn=0-00-628057-9|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protestant churches==
[[File:Skogskyrkogården at All Saints Day 2010-1.jpg|thumb|Graves lit by candles in Sweden]]
At the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] the celebration of All Souls' Day was fused with [[All Saints' Day]] in the [[Church of England]], though it was renewed individually in certain churches in connection with the [[Catholic Revival]] of the 19th century. The observance was restored with the publication of the 1980 ''[[Alternative Service Book]]'', and it features in ''[[Common Worship]]'' as a [[Lesser Festival]] called &quot;Commemoration of the Faithful Departed (All Souls' Day)&quot;.

Among continental [[Protestantism|Protestants]] its tradition has been more tenaciously maintained. Even [[Martin Luther (religious leader)|Luther's]] influence was not sufficient to abolish its celebration in [[Saxony]] during his lifetime; and, though its ecclesiastical sanction soon lapsed even in the [[Lutheran]] Church, its memory survives strongly in popular custom. Just as it is the custom of [[French people]], of all ranks and creeds, to decorate the graves of their dead on the ''jour des morts'', so [[German people|German]], {{sfn|Anonymous|1911}} [[Poles|Polish]] and [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] people stream to the graveyards once a year with offerings of flowers and special grave lights (see the picture). Among [[Czech people]] the custom of visiting and tidying graves of relatives on the day is quite common even among [[atheism|atheists]]. In North America, however, most Protestant acknowledgment of the holiday is generally secular, celebrated in the form of [[Halloween]] festivities.

In 1816, [[Prussia]] introduced a new date for the remembrance of the Dead among its Lutheran citizens: [[Totensonntag]], the last Sunday before [[Advent]]. This custom was later also adopted by the non-Prussian Lutherans in Germany, but it has not spread much beyond the Protestant areas of Germany.

In the [[Methodist Church]], [[Saints in Methodism|saints]] refer to ''all'' [[Christian]]s and therefore, on [[All Saint's Day]], the [[Church Universal]], as well as the deceased members of a [[local congregation]] are honoured and remembered.&lt;ref name=Methodism&gt;{{cite web|author=Laura Huff Hileman|title=What is All Saint's Day?|url=http://upperroom.org/askjulian/default.asp?act=answer&amp;itemid=276387|quote=Saints are just people who are trying to listen to God's word and live God's call. This is &quot;the communion of saints&quot; that we speak of in the Apostle's Creed -- that fellowship of believers that reaches beyond time and place, even beyond death.

==Origins, practices and purposes==
Some believe that the origins of  All Souls' Day in [[European folklore]] and [[folk belief]] are related to customs of [[ancestor veneration]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Norget2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Kristin Norget|title=Days of Death, Days of Life: Ritual in the Popular Culture of Oaxaca|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2PfDPufLSUEC&amp;pg=PA193|accessdate=2 November 2012|year=2006|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-13689-1|pages=193–}}&lt;/ref&gt; practised worldwide, through events such as the Chinese [[Ghost Festival]], the Japanese [[Bon Festival]]. The Roman custom was that of the [[Lemuria (festival)|Lemuria]].

The formal commemoration of the saints and martyrs ([[All Saints' Day]]) existed in the early Christian church since its [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius|legalization]], and alongside that developed a day for commemoration of all the dead (All Souls' Day). The modern date of All Souls' Day was first popularized in the early eleventh century after [[Odilo of Cluny|Abbot Odilo]] established it as a day for the monks of Cluny and associated monasteries to pray for the souls in purgatory. However, it was only much later in the Medieval period, when Europeans began to mix the two celebrations, that many traditions now associated with All Souls' Day are first recorded.

Many of these European traditions reflect the dogma of [[purgatory]]. For example, ringing bells for the dead was believed to comfort them in their cleansing there, while the sharing of [[soul cakes]] with the poor helped to buy the dead a bit of respite from the suffering of purgatory. In the same way, lighting candles was meant to kindle a light for the dead souls languishing in the darkness. Out of this grew the traditions of &quot;going souling&quot; and the baking of special types of bread or cakes.&lt;ref&gt;Medieval Histories 2012: 11:1 http://medievalhistories.com/wp-content/uploads/medievalhistories-november1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Tyrol (state)|Tirol]], cakes are left for them on the table and the room kept warm for their comfort. In [[Brittany]], people flock to the cemeteries at nightfall to kneel, bareheaded, at the graves of their loved ones, and to anoint the hollow of the [[tomb stone|tombstone]] with [[holy water]] or to pour libations of milk on it. At bedtime, the supper is left on the table for the souls.

In Bolivia, many people believe that the dead eat the food that is left out for them.
In Brazil people attend a Mass or visit the cemetery taking flowers to decorate their relatives' grave, but no food is involved.

In [[Malta]] many people make pilgrimages to graveyards, not just to visit the graves of their dead relatives, but to experience the special day in all its significance. Visits are not restricted to this day alone. During the month of November, Malta's cemeteries are frequented by families of the departed. Mass is also said throughout the month, with certain Catholic parishes organising special events at cemetery chapels.
