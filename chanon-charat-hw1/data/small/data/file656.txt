AMEX was previously a [[mutual organization]], owned by its members. Until 1953, it was known as the '''New York Curb Exchange'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klein|first=Maury|title=Rainbow's End: The Crash of 1929| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-513516-4|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
These [[broker]]s often traded stocks that were speculative in nature. With the discovery of oil in the later half of the 19th century, even oil stocks entered into the curb market. By 1865, following the [[American Civil War]], stocks in small industrial companies, such as iron and steel, textiles and chemicals were first sold by curbstone brokers. Efforts to organize and standardize the market started early in the 20th century under [[Emanuel S. Mendels]] and Carl H. Pforzheimer [http://books.google.com/books?id=F92F1rvEt4UC&amp;pg=PA178&amp;lpg=PA178&amp;dq=carl+pforzheimer+curb+exchange&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6nrYcotZG0&amp;sig=6gUb0AtyA14N15TfUY4qEXJ96gM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DF6xT_adDMjYiAKX6tiLAw&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=carl%20pforzheimer%20curb%20exchange&amp;f=false]. In 1908, the New York Curb Market Agency was established, to codify trading practices. In 1911, the curbstone brokers came to be known as the New York Curb Market, which then had a formal constitution with brokerage and listing standards. After several years of outdoor trading, the curbstone brokers moved indoors in 1921 to [[American Stock Exchange Building|New York Curb Exchange Building]] on [[Greenwich Street]] in [[Lower Manhattan]]. In 1929, the New York Curb Market changed its name to the New York Curb Exchange. Within no time, the Curb Exchange became the leading international stock market, listing more foreign issues than all other U.S. securities markets combined. In 1953 the Curb Exchange was renamed the American Stock Exchange.

[[Paul Kolton]] was named as president of the exchange in 1971, making him the first person to be selected from within the exchange to serve as its leader, succeeding Ralph S. Saul, who announced his resignation in March 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Rustin, Richard E. (May 14, 1971).
