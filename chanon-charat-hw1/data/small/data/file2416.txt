'''Bronze''' is an [[alloy]] consisting primarily of [[copper]] and other metals. The addition of other metals (usually [[tin]],  sometimes [[arsenic]]), produces an alloy much harder than plain copper. The historical period where the archeological record contains many bronze artifacts is known as the [[Bronze Age]].

Because historical pieces were often made of [[brass]]es (copper and [[zinc]]) and bronzes with different compositions, modern museum and scholarly descriptions of older objects increasingly use the more inclusive term &quot;[[copper alloy]]&quot; instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?scopeType=Terms&amp;scopeId=18864|title=British Museum, &quot;Scope Note&quot; for &quot;copper alloy&quot;|work=British Museum|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''bronze'' (1730–40) is borrowed from [[French language|French]] ''bronze'' (1511), itself borrowed from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''bronzo'' &quot;bell metal, brass&quot; (13th century) (transcribed in [[Medieval Latin]] as ''bronzium''), from either:

==History==
[[File:Defang Ding.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[China|Chinese]] [[Ding (vessel)|Ding]], [[Western Zhou]] (1046–771 BC)]]
The discovery of bronze enabled people to create metal objects which were harder and more durable than previously possible. Bronze tools, weapons, armor, and [[building material]]s such as decorative tiles were harder and more durable than their stone and copper (&quot;[[Chalcolithic]]&quot;) predecessors. Initially, bronze was made out of copper and [[arsenic]], forming [[arsenic bronze]], or from naturally or artificially mixed ores of copper and arsenic.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} It was only later that [[tin]] was used, becoming the major non-copper ingredient of bronze in the late 3rd millennium BC.&lt;ref&gt;Brett Kaufman, &quot;Metallurgy and Archaeological Change in the Ancient Near East&quot;, ''Backdirt: Annual Review'' 2011, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Tin bronze was superior to arsenic bronze in that the alloying process could be more easily controlled, and the resulting alloy was stronger and easier to cast. Also, [[Arsenic poisoning|unlike arsenic]], tin is not toxic.

The earliest tin-alloy bronze dates to 4500 BCE in a [[Vinča culture]] site in [[Pločnik (archaeological site)|Pločnik]] ([[Serbia]]).&lt;ref name=antiquity1312/&gt; Other early examples date to the late 4th millennium BC in Africa&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Africa#Metallurgy&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Susa]] ([[Iran]]) and some ancient sites in China, [[Luristan]] (Iran) and [[Mesopotamia]] ([[Iraq]]).{{citation needed|reason=according to what evidence??|date=December 2012}}

[[Ore]]s of copper and the far rarer tin are not often found together (exceptions include one ancient site in [[Thailand]] and one in Iran), so serious bronze work has always involved trade. [[Tin sources and trade in ancient times]] had a major influence on the development of cultures.  In Europe, a major source of tin was [[England]]'s deposits of ore in [[Cornwall]], which were traded as far as [[Phoenicia]] in the Eastern [[Mediterranean]].

Though bronze is generally harder than [[wrought iron]], with [[Vickers hardness test|Vickers hardness]] of 60–258&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allaboutgemstones.com/metal_jewelry_bronze.html Precious Metals: Bronze Jewelry]. Allaboutgemstones.com. Retrieved on 2012-06-09.&lt;/ref&gt; vs. 30–80,&lt;ref&gt;''Smithells Metals Reference Book'', 8th Edition, ch. 22&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bronze Age]] gave way to the [[Iron Age]] because iron was easier to find and easier to process into a usable grade of metal (it can be made into higher grades, but doing so takes significantly more effort and skill). Pure iron is soft, and the process of beating and folding [[sponge iron]] to make wrought iron removes from the metal carbon and other impurities which need to be re-introduced to improve hardness. Careful control of the alloying and [[Tempering (metallurgy)|tempering]] eventually allowed for wrought iron with properties comparable to modern [[steel]].

Bronze was still used during the Iron Age. For many purposes, the weaker wrought iron was found to be sufficiently strong. Archaeologists suspect that a serious disruption of the tin trade precipitated the transition. The population migrations around 1200–1100 BC reduced the shipping of tin around the Mediterranean (and from Great Britain), limiting supplies and raising prices.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton E. Cramer. [http://www.claytoncramer.com/unpublished/Iron2.pdf What Caused The Iron Age?] claytoncramer.com. December 10, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bianzhong.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bianzhong of Marquis Yi of Zeng]], [[Spring and Autumn Period]] (476–221 BC)]] As the art of working in [[iron]] improved, iron became cheaper, and as cultures advanced from wrought iron (typically forged by hand – ''wrought'' – by blacksmiths) to machine forged iron (typically made with [[trip hammer]]s powered by water), the blacksmiths learned how to make steel, which is stronger than bronze and holds a sharper edge longer.&lt;ref&gt;Oleg D.

There are many different bronze alloys, but typically modern bronze is 88% [[copper]] and 12% [[tin]].&lt;ref&gt;Knapp, Brian. (1996) ''Copper, Silver and Gold''. Reed Library, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Alpha bronze''' consists of the alpha [[solid solution]] of tin in copper. Alpha bronze alloys of 4–5% tin are used to make [[coin]]s, [[spring (device)|springs]], [[turbine]]s and [[blade]]s. Historical &quot;bronzes&quot; are highly variable in composition, as most metalworkers probably used whatever scrap was on hand; the metal of the 12th-century English [[Gloucester Candlestick]] is bronze containing a mixture of copper, zinc, tin, lead, nickel, iron, antimony, arsenic with an unusually large amount of silver – between 22.5% in the base and 5.76% in the pan below the candle. The proportions of this mixture may suggest that the candlestick was made from a hoard of old coins.  The [[Benin Bronzes]] are really brass, and the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Liège]] is described as both bronze and brass.

In the Bronze Age, two forms of bronze were commonly used: &quot;classic bronze&quot;, about 10% tin, was used in casting; and &quot;mild bronze&quot;, about 6% tin, was hammered from ingots to make sheets. Bladed weapons were mostly cast from classic bronze, while helmets and armor were hammered from mild bronze.

'''Commercial bronze''' (90% copper and 10% zinc) and '''architectural bronze''' (57% copper, 3% [[lead]], 40% zinc) are more properly  regarded as [[brass]] alloys because they contain [[zinc]] as the main alloying ingredient. They are commonly used in architectural applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copper.org/applications/architecture/arch_dhb/copper_alloys/intro.html|title=Copper alloys|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copper.org/resources/properties/standard-designations/introduction.html|title=CDA UNS Standard Designations for Wrought and Cast Copper and Copper Alloys: Introduction|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bismuth bronze]] is a bronze alloy with a composition of 52% copper, 30% nickel, 12% zinc, 5% lead, and 1% bismuth. It is able to hold a good polish and so is sometimes used in light reflectors and mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southerncrossmetalrecyclers.com.au/scrap/bismuth-bronze.html|title=Bismuth Bronze|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plastic bronze''' is bronze containing a significant quantity of lead which makes for improved plasticity&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/plastic+bronze plastic bronze definition of plastic bronze in the Free Online Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; possibly used by the ancient Greeks in their ship construction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1095-9270.12001/full The Belgammel Ram, a Hellenistic-Roman Bronze Proembolion Found off the Coast of Libya: test analysis of function, date and metallurgy, with a digital reference archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other bronze alloys include [[aluminium bronze]], [[phosphor bronze]], manganese bronze, [[bell metal]], [[arsenical bronze]], [[speculum metal]] and [[cymbal alloys]].

==Properties==
[[File:Bronze bell with visible material structure.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Bronze bell with a visible [[crystallite]] structure.]]

Typically bronze only oxidizes superficially; once a copper oxide (eventually becoming copper carbonate) layer is formed, the underlying metal is [[Passivation (chemistry)|protected from further corrosion]]. However, if copper chlorides are formed, a corrosion-mode called &quot;[[bronze disease]]&quot; will eventually completely destroy it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://proteus.brown.edu/greekpast/4867|title=Bronze Disease, Archaeologies of the Greek Past|publisher=|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Copper-based [[alloy]]s have lower [[melting point]]s than steel or iron, and are more readily produced from their constituent metals. They are generally about 10 percent denser than steel, although alloys using [[aluminium]] or [[silicon]] may be slightly less dense. Bronzes are softer and weaker than steel—bronze [[spring (device)|springs]], for example, are less stiff (and so store less energy) for the same bulk. Bronze resists [[corrosion]] (especially seawater corrosion) and [[metal fatigue]] more than steel and is a better conductor of heat and electricity than most steels. The cost of copper-base alloys is generally higher than that of steels but lower than that of [[nickel]]-base alloys.

Copper and its alloys have a huge variety of uses that reflect their versatile physical, mechanical, and [[Chemical property|chemical properties]]. Some common examples are the high [[electrical conductivity]] of pure copper, the low-friction properties of bearing bronze (bronze which has a high lead content— 6-8%), the resonant qualities of bell bronze (20% tin, 80% copper), and the resistance to corrosion by [[sea water]] of several bronze alloys.

The melting point of bronze varies depending on the ratio of the alloy components and is about {{convert|950|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Bronze may be nonmagnetic, but certain alloys containing iron or nickel may have magnetic properties.

==Uses==

Bronze was especially suitable for use in boat and ship fittings prior to the wide employment of [[stainless steel]] owing to its combination of toughness and resistance to salt water corrosion. Bronze is still commonly used in ship propellers and submerged bearings.

In the 20th century, [[silicon]] was introduced as the primary alloying element, creating an alloy with wide application in industry and the major form used in contemporary [[statuary]]. Sculptors may prefer silicon bronze because of the ready availability of silicon bronze brazing rod, which allows color-matched repair of defects in castings. Aluminium is also used for the structural metal [[aluminium bronze]].

It is also widely used for cast [[bronze sculpture]]. Many common bronze alloys have the unusual and very desirable property of expanding slightly just before they set, thus filling in the finest details of a [[molding (process)|mold]]. Bronze parts are [[Toughness|tough]] and typically used for [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], clips, [[electrical connector]]s and [[Spring (device)|springs]].

Bronze also has very low metal-on-metal [[friction]], making it invaluable for the building of [[cannon]] where iron cannonballs would otherwise stick in the barrel.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlavudeenVenkateshwaran2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=A.

[[Phosphor bronze]] is particularly suited to precision-grade bearings and springs. It is also used in guitar and piano strings.

Unlike steel, bronze struck against a hard surface will not generate sparks, so it (along with [[beryllium copper]]) is used to make [[hammer]]s, [[mallet]]s, [[wrench]]es and other durable tools to be used in explosive atmospheres or in the presence of flammable vapors.

Bronze is used to make [[bronze wool]] for woodworking applications where [[steel wool]] would discolor [[oak]].

In India, bronze sculptures from the [[Kushana]] ([[Chausa hoard]]) and [[Gupta]] periods ([[Brahma from Mirpur-Khas]], Akota Hoard, [[Sultanganj Buddha]]) and later periods ([[Hansi]] Hoard) have been found.&lt;ref&gt;Indian bronze masterpieces: the great tradition : specially published for the Festival of India, Asharani Mathur, Sonya Singh, Festival of India, Brijbasi Printers, Dec 1, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
Indian Hindu artisans from the period of the [[Chola dynasty|Chola empire]] in [[Tamil Nadu]] used bronze to create intricate statues via the [[lost wax casting]] method with ornate detailing depicting the deities of [[Hinduism]] mostly, but also the lifestyle of the period. The art form survives to this day, with many silpis, craftsmen, working in the areas of [[Swamimalai]] and [[Chennai]].

The [[Assyria]]n king [[Sennacherib]] (704–681 BC) claims to have been the first to cast monumental bronze statues (of up to 30 tonnes) using two-part moulds instead of the lost-wax method.&lt;ref&gt;for a translation of his inscription see the appendix in Stephanie Dalley, (2013) ''The Mystery of the Hanging Garden of Babylon: an elusive World Wonder traced,'' OUP.

[[File:Benin Bronzes.jpg|thumb|Bronze sculptures from [[Benin Bronzes|Benin]]]]
In antiquity other cultures also produced works of [[High culture|high art]] using bronze. For example: in Africa, the [[Benin Bronzes|bronze heads]] of the [[Benin Empire|Kingdom of Benin]]; in Europe, Grecian bronzes typically of figures from [[Greek mythology]]; in [[east Asia]], Chinese bronzes of the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] and [[Zhou dynasty]]—more often ceremonial vessels but including some figurine examples. Bronze sculptures, although known for their longevity, still undergo microbial degradation; such as from certain species of yeasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Microorganisms Attack Synthetic Polymers in Items Representing Our Cultural Heritage|author1=Francesca Cappitelli|author2=Claudia Sorlini|journal=Applied Environmental Microbiology|year=2008|volume=74|pmc=2227722|pmid=18065627|doi=10.1128/AEM.01768-07|issue=3|pages=564–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bronze continues into modern times as one of the materials of choice for monumental statuary.

===Musical instruments===
[[File:Picsingingbowls.jpg|thumb|Antique bell metal bronze [[singing bowl]]s from the 16th to 18th centuries. Annealed bronze continues to be made in the Himalayas.]]
Bronze is the preferred metal for top-quality [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s, particularly [[bell metal]], which is about 23% tin.

Nearly all professional [[cymbal]]s are made from bronze, which gives a desirable balance of durability and [[timbre]]. Several types of bronze are used, commonly [[B20 (bronze)|B20 bronze]], which is roughly 20% tin, 80% copper, with traces of silver, or the tougher B8 bronze which is made from 8% tin and 92% copper. As the tin content in a bell or cymbal rises, the timbre drops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Lothar|last=Von Falkenhausen|title=Suspended Music: Chime-Bells in the Culture of Bronze Age China|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles|publisher=University of California Press|year=1993|page=106|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ve1h53NTNW0C&amp;pg=PA106&amp;lpg=PA106 | isbn=978-0-520-07378-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bronze is also used for the windings of steel and nylon strings of various [[String instrument|stringed instruments]] such as the [[double bass]], [[piano]], [[harpsichord]], and the [[guitar]]. Bronze strings are commonly reserved on pianoforte for the lower pitch tones, as they possess a superior sustain quality to that of high-tensile steel.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;McCreight, Tim. ''Metals technic: a collection of techniques for metalsmiths''. Brynmorgen Press, 1992. ISBN 0-9615984-3-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Bronzes of various metallurgical properties are widely used in struck [[idiophones]] around the world, notably bells, singing bowls, gongs, cymbals and other idiophones from [[Asia]]. Examples include Tibetan [[singing bowls]], temple [[bell (instrument)|bell]]s of many sizes and shapes, gongs, [[Javanese people|Javanese]] [[gamelan]] and other bronze [[musical instrument]]s. The earliest bronze archeological finds in [[Indonesia]] date from 1–2 BCE, including flat plates probably suspended and struck by a wooden or bone mallet.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LaPlantz, David. ''Jewelry – Metalwork 1991 Survey: Visions – Concepts – Communication'': S. LaPlantz: 1991. ISBN 0-942002-05-9&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient bronze drums from Thailand and Vietnam date back 2,000 years. Bronze bells from Thailand and Cambodia date back to 3,600 BCE.

Some companies are now making [[saxophone]]s from [[phosphor bronze]] (3.5 to 10% tin and up to 1% phosphorus content).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sax.co.uk/signature-custom-alto-sax-phosphor-bronze-big-bell.ir|title=www.sax.co.uk|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bell bronze is used to make the tone rings of many professional model banjos.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The tone ring is a heavy (usually 3&amp;nbsp;lbs.) folded or arched metal ring attached to a thick wood rim, over which a skin, or most often, a plastic membrane (or head) is stretched - it is the bell bronze that gives the banjo a crisp powerful lower register and clear, bell-like treble register-especially in bluegrass music.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

===Medals===
{{See also|Bronze medal}}

Bronze has been used in the manufacture of various types of [[medal]]s for centuries, and are known in contemporary times for being awarded for third place in sporting competitions and other events. The later usage was in part attributed to the choices of [[gold]], [[silver]] and bronze to represent the first three [[Ages of Man]] in [[Greek mythology]]: the [[Golden Age]], when men lived among the gods; the [[Silver age]], where youth lasted a hundred years; and the [[Greek Heroic Age|Bronze Age]], the era of heroes, and was first adopted at the [[1904 Summer Olympics]]. At the 1896 event, silver was awarded to winners and bronze to runners-up, while at 1900 other prizes were given, not medals.

===Industrial===
