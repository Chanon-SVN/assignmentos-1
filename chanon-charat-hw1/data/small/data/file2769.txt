'''&quot;The Big Apple&quot;''' is a nickname for [[New York City]]. It was first popularized in the 1920s by [[John J. Fitz Gerald]], a sports writer for the ''[[New York Morning Telegraph]]''. Its popularity since the 1970s is due to a promotional campaign by the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, known now as [[NYC &amp; Company]].

Although the history of ''the Big Apple '' was once thought a mystery,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a1_382.html Why is New York called the Big Apple?], [[The Straight Dope]] February 18, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; research – primarily by amateur etymologist [[Barry Popik]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/ The Big Apple].

Previously, there were a number of false etymologies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/category/C10/ False Etymologies].&lt;/ref&gt; including a claim that the term derived from a New York brothel whose madam was known as Eve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/19971010010804/http://www.salwen.com/apple.html Why Is New York City Called &quot;The Big Apple&quot;?] [[Digital time capsule|Wayback Machine]] archive of earlier version of web page.&lt;/ref&gt; This was subsequently exposed as a hoax&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/big_apple_whore_hoax_1800s/ Big Apple Whore Hoax (1800s!)].&lt;/ref&gt; and has been replaced on the source website with more accurate information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://salwen.com/apple.html Why Is New York City Called &quot;The Big Apple&quot;?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest citation for &quot;big apple&quot; is the 1909 book ''The Wayfarer in New York'' by Edward S. Martin, writing: &quot;Kansas is apt to see in New York a greedy city.... It inclines to think that '''the big apple''' gets a disproportionate share of the national sap&quot; (emphasis added).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = William | last = Safire | authorlink = William Safire | title = Big Applesource | journal = [[The New York Times Magazine]] | date = September 17, 2000 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/17/magazine/the-way-we-live-now-9-17-00-on-language-slurvian.html?pagewanted=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = William | last = Safire | authorlink = William Safire | title = The Right Word in the Right Place at the Right Time | year = 2004 | page = [http://books.google.com/books?id=blcCxBWVdzgC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=big%20apple p. 23]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Safire]] considered this the coinage, but the ''Random House Dictionary of American Slang'' considers the usage &quot;metaphorical or perhaps proverbial, rather than a concrete example of the later slang term&quot;, and Popik likewise does not consider this the coinage.

In the early 1920s, &quot;apple&quot; was used in reference to the many racing courses in and around New York City. Apple referred to the prizes being awarded for the races – as these were important races, the rewards were substantial.

''The Big Apple'' was first popularized as a reference to New York City by John J. Fitz Gerald in a number of ''New York Morning Telegraph'' articles in the 1920s in reference to New York horse-racing. The earliest of these was a casual reference on May 3, 1921:

{{quote|J. P. Smith, with Tippity Witchet and others of the L. T. Bauer string, is scheduled to start for &quot;the big apple&quot; to-morrow after a most prosperous Spring campaign at Bowie and Havre de Grace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/first_big_apple_may_3_1921/ First “Big Apple”: May 3, 1921].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fitz Gerald referred to the &quot;big apple&quot; frequently thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/numerous_1920s_big_apple_citations_in_the_new_york_morning_telegraph/ Numerous 1920s “Big Apple” citations in the New York Morning Telegraph].&lt;/ref&gt; He explained his use in a February 18, 1924, column under the headline &quot;Around the Big Apple&quot;:

{{quote|The Big Apple. The dream of every lad that ever threw a leg over a thoroughbred and the goal of all horsemen. There's only one Big Apple. That's New York.

Two dusky stable hands were leading a pair of thoroughbreds around the &quot;cooling rings&quot; of adjoining stables at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans and engaging in desultory conversation.

&quot;Where y'all goin' from here?&quot; queried one.

&quot;From here we're headin' for The Big Apple,&quot; proudly replied the other.

&quot;Well, you'd better fatten up them skinners or all you'll get from the apple will be the core,&quot; was the quick rejoinder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/first_big_apple_explanation_february_18_1924/ First “Big Apple” explanation: February 18, 1924]. See also the original article [http://www.barrypopik.com/images/FitzGerald1.gif image].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Fitz Gerald's reference to the &quot;dusky&quot; stable hands suggests the term's origin may lie in [[African-American]] culture. Support for this is found in the ''[[Chicago Defender]]'', an African-American newspaper that had a national circulation. “Ragtime” Billy Tucker, a vaudeville/ragtime performer and writer for the ''Defender'', there used &quot;big apple&quot; to refer to New York in a non-horse-racing context on September 16, 1922:

{{quote|I trust your trip to 'the big apple' (New York) was a huge success and only wish that I had been able to make it with you.&lt;ref name=&quot;linguistlist_antedating_1920vaudeville&quot;&gt;[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0801D&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;P=R9794 &quot;Big Apple&quot; antedating]; [http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/1920s_vaudeville_ragtime_big_apple_citations/ 1920s Vaudeville/Ragtime “Big Apple” Citations].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tucker had earlier used &quot;Big Apple&quot; as a reference to a different city, Los Angeles.  This example, from May 15, 1920, is the earliest known use of &quot;Big Apple&quot; to refer to any city.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} &lt;!-- huh? see the 1909 quote earlier in the article --&gt; It is possible that the writer simply understood &quot;Big Apple&quot; as an appropriate nickname for any large city:

{{quote|Dear Pal, Tony: No, Ragtime Billy Tucker hasn't dropped completely out of existence, but is still in the 'Big Apple', Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;linguistlist_antedating_1920vaudeville&quot; /&gt;}}

By the late 1920s, New York writers other than Fitz Gerald were starting to use &quot;Big Apple&quot; and were using it outside of a horse-racing context.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/1920s_non_horseracing_big_apple_citations/ 1920s Non-Horseracing “Big Apple” Citations].&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Big Apple&quot; was a popular song&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/big_apple_song_by_bob_emmerich/ “Big Apple” song by Bob Emmerich].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Big Apple (dance)|dance]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/big_apple_in_the_1930s_two_clubs_plus_song_and_dance/ “Big Apple” in the 1930s (Two clubs, plus song and dance)].&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1930s.  [[Walter Winchell]] and other writers continued to use the name in the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/big_apple_in_the_1940s_1950s/ “Big Apple” in the 1940s-1950s].&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s, &quot;the Big Apple&quot; was known only as an old name for New York.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Vonnegut, ''Slaughterhouse-Five'' 265 (1969; Delta Trade Paperbacks ed. 1999) (&quot;That's what they used to call New York&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, however, the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau (now NYC &amp; Company, the official marketing and tourism organization for New York City),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycvisit.com/content/index.cfm?pagePkey=20 About NYC and Company].&lt;/ref&gt; under the leadership of its president, Charles Gillett, began promoting &quot;the Big Apple&quot; for the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/big_apple_1970s_revival_charlie_gillett_and_lew_rudin/ Big Apple 1970s Revival: Charlie Gillett and Lew Rudin].&lt;/ref&gt; It has remained popular since then.&lt;ref name=voa&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www1.voanews.com/a-23-2009-12-24-voa2-84659432.html|title=Words and Their Stories: Nicknames for New York City|date=February 23, 2010|work=[[Voice of America]]|accessdate=March 2, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100413182642/http://www1.voanews.com/a-23-2009-12-24-voa2-84659432.html| archivedate= April 13, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor [[Rudolph W. Giuliani]] in 1997 signed legislation designating the southwest corner of West [[54th Street (Manhattan)|54th Street]] and Broadway, the corner on which John J. Fitz Gerald lived from 1934 to 1963, as &quot;Big Apple Corner&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/om/html/97/sp082-97.html Mayor's Press Office, Release No. 082-97, Mayor Giuliani Signs Legislation Creating &quot;Big Apple Corner&quot; in Manhattan (Feb. 12, 1997)].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York Mets]] have featured a &quot;Home Run Apple&quot; that rises whenever a Mets player hits a home run. It has become a symbol of the Mets baseball team, recognized throughout [[Major League Baseball]] as an iconic feature of the Mets' stadiums. It first appeared in [[Shea Stadium]], and the original can still be seen on display at [[Citi Field]], outside the Jackie Robinson Rotunda. Citi Field now uses a new apple, one that is nearly four times the size of the original.

In ''[[Evita (musical)|Evita]]'', [[Buenos Aires]] is referred to as &quot;B.A., Buenos Aires, Big Apple&quot; in the song ''Eva, Beware of the City''. This reference was invented by lyricist [[Tim Rice]] and does not reflect preexisting use.

The term &quot;big apple&quot; was used by Frank Sinatra speaking to opera singer Dorothy Kirsten (who was his co-star in the late 1940s-early 1950s NBC radio program &quot;Light Up  Time&quot; on a show that aired on March 28, 1950 at about the 2:30 mark.
