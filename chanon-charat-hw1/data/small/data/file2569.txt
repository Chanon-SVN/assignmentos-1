The '''bald eagle''' (''Haliaeetus leucocephalus'', from Greek ''hali-'' = sea, ''aiētos'' = [[eagle]], ''leuco-'' = white, ''cephalos'' = head) is a [[bird of prey]] found in North America. A [[sea eagle]], it has two known sub-species and forms a [[Cryptic species complex|species pair]] with the [[white-tailed eagle]] (''Haliaeetus albicilla''). Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the [[contiguous United States]], and northern Mexico. It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting.

The bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on [[fish]], which it swoops down and snatches from the water with its talons. It builds the largest [[bird nest|nest]] of any North American bird and the largest tree nests ever recorded for any animal species, up to {{convert|4|m|ft|sp=us|abbr = on}} deep, {{convert|2.5|m|ft|sp=us|abbr = on}} wide, and {{convert|1|t|ST|lk = on|sp = us}} in weight.&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt; [[Sexual maturity]] is attained at the age of four to five years.

Bald eagles are not actually [[bald]]; the name derives from an older meaning of &quot;white headed&quot;. The adult is mainly brown with a white head and tail. The sexes are identical in [[plumage]], but females are about 25 percent larger than males. The [[beak]] is large and hooked. The plumage of the immature is brown.

The bald eagle is both the [[List of national birds|national bird]] and [[List of national animals|national animal]] of the United States of America. The bald eagle appears on its [[Great Seal of the United States|Seal]]. In the late 20th century it was on the brink of [[local extinction|extirpation]] in the continental United States. Populations recovered and the species was removed from the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government's]] list of [[endangered species]] on July 12, 1995 and transferred to the list of [[threatened species]]. It was removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in the [[Continental United States|Lower 48]] States on June 28, 2007.

==Description==
The [[plumage]] of an adult bald eagle is evenly dark brown with a white head and tail. The tail is moderately long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but [[sexual dimorphism]] is evident in the species, in that females are 25% larger than males.&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt; The beak, feet and [[iris (anatomy)|irises]] are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;/&gt; The [[beak]] is large and hooked, with a yellow [[cere]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornell&quot;/&gt; The adult bald eagle is unmistakable in its native range. The closely related [[African fish eagle]] (''H. vocifer'') (from far outside the bald eagle's range) also has a brown body, white head and tail, but differs from the bald in having a white chest and black tip to the bill.&lt;ref name= Ferguson-Lees/&gt;

The plumage of the immature is a dark brown overlaid with messy white streaking until the fifth (rarely fourth, very rarely third) year, when it reaches sexual maturity.&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;/&gt; Immature bald eagles are distinguishable from the [[golden eagle]] (''Aquila chrysaetos''), the only other very large, non-vulturine bird in North America, in that the former has a larger, more protruding head with a larger [[beak]], straighter edged wings which are held flat (not slightly raised) and with a stiffer wing beat and feathers which do not completely cover the legs. When seen well, the golden eagle is distinctive in plumage with a more solid warm brown color than an immature bald eagle, with a reddish-golden patch to its nape and (in immature birds) a highly contrasting set of white squares on the wing.&lt;ref name=&quot;sibley&quot;/&gt; Another distinguishing feature of the immature bald eagle over the mature bird is its black,  yellow-tipped beak; the mature eagle has a fully yellow beak.

The bald eagle has sometimes been considered the largest true raptor ([[Accipitriformes|accipitrid]]) in North America. The only larger species of raptor-like bird is the [[California condor]] (''Gymnogyps californianus''), a [[New World vulture]] which today is not generally considered a taxonomic ally of true accipitrids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travsky&quot;/&gt; However, the [[golden eagle]], averaging {{convert|4.18|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and {{convert|63|cm|in|abbr=on}} in [[Wing chord (biology)|wing chord length]] in its American race (''A. c. canadensis''), is merely {{convert|455|g|lb|abbr=on}} lighter in mean body mass and exceeds the bald eagle in mean wing chord length by around {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name= Ferguson-Lees/&gt;&lt;ref name= Watson/&gt; Additionally, the bald eagle's close cousins, the relatively longer-winged but shorter-tailed [[white-tailed eagle]] and the overall larger [[Steller's sea eagle]] (''H. pelagicus''), may, rarely, wander to coastal Alaska from Asia.&lt;ref name= Ferguson-Lees/&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
The bald eagle has a body length of {{convert|70|–|102|cm|in|sp=us|abbr = on}}. Typical wingspan is between {{convert|1.8|and|2.3|m|ft|abbr=on}} and mass is normally between {{convert|3|and|6.3|kg|lb|sp=us|abbr = on}}.&lt;ref name= Ferguson-Lees/&gt; Females are about 25% larger than males, averaging {{convert|5.6|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, and against the males' average weight of {{convert|4.1|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt;&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref name=b2/&gt; The size of the bird varies by location and generally corresponds with [[Bergmann's rule]], since the species increases in size further away from the Equator and the tropics. For example, eagles from [[South Carolina]] average {{convert|3.27|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in mass and {{convert|1.88|m|ft|abbr=on}} in wingspan, smaller than their northern counterparts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Murphy&quot;/&gt; The largest eagles are from [[Alaska]], where large females may weigh up to {{convert|7.5|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and span {{convert|2.44|m|ft|abbr=on}} across the wings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornell&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=r2/&gt; A survey of adult weights in Alaska showed that females weighed on average {{convert|6.3|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and males weighed {{convert|4.3|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;&gt;''Eagles, Hawks and Falcons of the World'' by Leslie Brown &amp; Dean Amadon. The Wellfleet Press (1986), ISBN 978-1-55521-472-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Among standard linear measurements, the [[Wing chord (biology)|wing chord]] is {{convert|51.5|-|69|cm|in|abbr=on}}, the [[tail]] is {{convert|23|-|37|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, and the [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]] is {{convert|8|to|11|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name= Ferguson-Lees/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BNA&quot;&gt;[http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/506/articles/introduction Bald Eagle]. Birds of North America Online. Bna.birds.cornell.edu. Retrieved on 2012-12-24.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Culmen (bird)|culmen]] reportedly ranges from {{convert|3|to|7.5|cm|in|abbr=on}}, while the measurement from the [[gape]] to the tip of the bill is {{convert|7|-|9|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;BNA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=j1/&gt;

The call consists of weak staccato, chirping whistles, ''kleek kik ik ik ik'', somewhat similar in cadence to a [[gull]]'s call. The calls of young birds tend to be more harsh and shrill than those of adults.&lt;ref name= Ferguson-Lees/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sibley&quot;/&gt;

==Taxonomy==
The bald eagle placed in the genus ''Haliaeetus'' ([[sea eagle]]s) which gets both its common and  specific scientific names from the distinctive appearance of the adult's head. ''Bald'' in the [[English language|English]] name is derived from the word ''[[piebald]]'', and refers to the white head and tail feathers and their contrast with the darker body.&lt;ref name=b7/&gt; The scientific name is derived from ''Haliaeetus'', [[New Latin]] for &quot;sea eagle&quot; (from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''haliaetos''), and ''leucocephalus'', Latinized Ancient Greek for &quot;white head,&quot; from λευκος ''leukos'' (&quot;white&quot;) and κεφαλη ''kephale'' (&quot;head&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Georgia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Liddell 1980&quot;/&gt;

The bald eagle was one of the many species originally described by [[Carolus Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] in his 18th century work ''[[Systema Naturae]]'', under the name ''Falco leucocephalus''.&lt;ref name=b3/&gt;

There are two recognized [[subspecies]] of bald eagle:&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ITIS&quot;/&gt;
* ''H. l. leucocephalus'' &lt;small&gt;(Linnaeus, 1766)&lt;/small&gt; is the nominate subspecies. It is found in the southern United States and [[Baja California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ESRP&quot;/&gt;
* ''H. l. washingtoniensis'' &lt;small&gt;(Audubon, 1827)&lt;/small&gt;, synonym ''H. l. alascanus'' Townsend, 1897, the northern subspecies, is larger than southern nominate ''leucocephalus ''. It is found in the northern United States, Canada and Alaska.&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ESRP&quot;/&gt;

The bald eagle forms a [[species pair]] with the [[Eurasia]]n white-tailed eagle. This species pair consists of a white-headed and a tan-headed species of roughly equal size; the white-tailed eagle also has overall somewhat paler brown body plumage. The two species fill the same [[ecological niche]] in their respective ranges. The pair diverged from other sea eagles at the beginning of the Early [[Miocene]] (c. 10&amp;nbsp;[[Ma (unit)|Ma BP]]) at the latest, but possibly as early as the Early/Middle [[Oligocene]], 28 Ma BP, if the most ancient fossil record is correctly assigned to this [[genus]].&lt;ref name=j2/&gt;

==Range==
The bald eagle's natural range covers most of North America, including most of [[Canada]], all of the [[continental United States]], and northern [[Mexico]]. It is the only sea eagle [[endemism|endemic]] to North America. Occupying varied habitats from the [[bayou]]s of [[Louisiana]] to the [[Sonoran Desert]] and the eastern deciduous forests of [[Quebec]] and [[New England]], northern birds are [[bird migration|migratory]], while southern birds are resident, remaining on their breeding territory all year. At minimum population, in the 1950s, it was largely restricted to [[Alaska]], the [[Aleutian Islands]], northern and eastern Canada, and [[Florida]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bull87&quot;/&gt; Today, they are much more common (almost attaining their peak numbers pre-colonization in North America), and nest in every continental state and province in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot;/&gt;

Bald eagles will also congregate in certain locations in winter. From November until February, one to two thousand birds winter in [[Squamish, British Columbia]], about halfway between [[Vancouver]] and [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]]. The birds primarily gather along the [[Squamish River|Squamish]] and [[Cheakamus River|Cheakamus]] Rivers, attracted by the [[salmon]] spawning in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baldeagleinfo.com/eagle/eagle1.html|author=Hope Rutledge|title=Where to View Bald Eagles|accessdate=2007-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has occurred as a [[vagrancy (biology)|vagrant]] twice in Ireland; a juvenile was shot illegally in [[Fermanagh]] on January 11, 1973 (misidentified at first as a white-tailed eagle), and an exhausted juvenile was captured in [[County Kerry|Kerry]] on November 15, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1987/Bald-Eagle-Lands-Exhausted-in-Ireland/id-fd7744016cc242f2c23ec570762c136a Bald Eagle Lands Exhausted in Ireland], Associated Press, 15 December 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat==
[[File:Bald Eagle and salmon.jpg|Juvenile with [[salmon]], [[Katmai National Park and Preserve|Katmai National Park]]|thumb]]
The bald eagle occurs during its breeding season in virtually any kind of American [[wetland]] habitat such as [[Coast|seacoasts]], [[river]]s, large [[lake]]s or [[marsh]]es or other large bodies of open water with an abundance of fish. Studies have shown a preference for bodies of water with a circumference greater than {{convert|11|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, and lakes with an area greater than {{convert|10|km2|sqmi|0|sp=us|abbr = on}} are optimal for breeding bald eagles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gov&quot;/&gt;

The bald eagle typically requires old-growth and mature stands of [[pinophyta|coniferous]] or [[hardwood]] trees for perching, roosting, and nesting. Tree species reportedly is less important to the eagle pair than the tree's height, composition and location.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suring&quot;/&gt; Perhaps of paramount importance for this species is an abundance of comparatively large trees surrounding the body of water. Selected trees must have good visibility, be over {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall, an open structure, and proximity to prey. If nesting trees are in standing water such as in a mangrove swamp, the nest can be located fairly low, at as low {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;FPL&quot;/&gt; In a more typical tree standing on dry ground, nests may be located from {{convert|16|to|38|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height. In [[Chesapeake Bay]], nesting trees averaged {{convert|82|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|28|m|ft|abbr=on}} in total height, while in Florida, the average nesting tree stands {{convert|23|m|ft|abbr=on}} high and is {{convert|23|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=j3/&gt;&lt;ref name=j4/&gt; Trees used for nesting in the [[Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem|Greater Yellowstone area]] average {{convert|27|m|ft|abbr=on}} high.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swenson, J. E. 1986&quot;/&gt; Trees or forest used for nesting should have a canopy cover of no more than 60%, and no less than 20%, and be in close proximity to water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gov&quot;/&gt; Most nests have been found within {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} of open water. The greatest distance from open water recorded for a bald eagle nest was over {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}}, in [[Florida]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Travsky&quot;/&gt;

Bald eagle nests are often very large in order to compensate for size of the birds. The largest recorded nest was found in Florida in 1963, and was measured at nearly 10 feet wide and 20 feet deep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-10000/largest-birds-nest/ |title=Largest bird's nest |publisher=Guinnessworldrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Florida, nesting habitats often consist of [[Mangrove|mangrove swamps]], the shorelines of lakes and rivers, [[pine]]lands, seasonally flooded [[flatwoods]], [[Swamp|hardwood swamps]], and open [[prairie]]s and [[pasture]]land with scattered tall trees. Favored nesting trees in Florida are [[Pinus elliottii|slash pines]] (''Pinus elliottii''), [[Pinus palustris|longleaf pines]] (''P. palustris''), [[Pinus taeda|loblolly pines]] (''P. taeda'') and [[Cupressaceae|cypress trees]], but for the southern coastal areas where mangroves are usually used.&lt;ref name=&quot;FPL&quot;/&gt; In [[Wyoming]], groves of mature [[Populus sect. Aigeiros|cottonwoods]] or tall pines found along streams and rivers are typical bald eagle nesting habitats. Wyoming eagles may inhabit habitat types ranging from large, old-growth stands of [[Pinus ponderosa|ponderosa pines]] (''Pinus ponderosa'') to narrow strips of riparian trees surrounded by rangeland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travsky&quot;/&gt; In [[Southeast Alaska]], [[Picea sitchensis|Sitka spruce]] (''Picea sitchensis'') provided 78% of the nesting trees used by eagles, followed by [[Tsuga|hemlocks]] (''Tsuga'') at 20%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Suring&quot;/&gt; Increasingly, eagles nest in man-made reservoirs stocked with fish.&lt;ref name=&quot;FPL&quot;/&gt;

[[File:2010-bald-eagle-with-fish.jpg|thumb|left|With freshly caught fish in [[Kodiak Island|Kodiak]]]]
The bald eagle is usually quite sensitive to human activity while nesting, and is found most commonly in areas with minimal human disturbance. It chooses sites more than {{convert|1.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} from low-density human disturbance and more than {{convert|1.8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from medium- to high-density human disturbance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gov&quot;/&gt; However, bald eagles will occasionally venture into large estuaries or secluded groves within major cities, such as Hardtack Island on the [[Willamette River]] in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] or [[John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge at Tinicum]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], which are surrounded by a great quantity of human activity.&lt;ref name=r3/&gt;&lt;ref name=r4/&gt; Even more contrary to the usual sensitivity to disturbance, a family of bald eagles moved to the [[Harlem]] neighborhood in [[New York City]] in 2010.&lt;ref name=r5/&gt;

While wintering, bald eagles tend to be less habitat and disturbance sensitive. They will commonly congregate at spots with plentiful perches and waters with plentiful prey and (in Northern climes) partially unfrozen waters. Alternately, non-breeding or wintering bald eagles, particularly in areas with a lack of human disturbance, spend their time in various upland, terrestrial habitats sometimes quite far away from waterways. In the northern half of North America (especially the interior portion), this terrestrial inhabitance by bald eagles tends to be especially prevalent because unfrozen water may not be accessible. Upland wintering habitats often consist of open habitats with concentrations of medium-sized mammals, such as [[prairie]]s, [[meadow]]s or [[tundra]], or open forests with regular carrion access.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travsky&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Suring&quot;/&gt;

==Behavior==
[[File:Bald Eagle Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Head details]]
The bald eagle is a powerful flier, and soars on [[thermal|thermal convection currents]]. It reaches speeds of {{convert|56|–|70|km/h|mph|sp=us|abbr = on}} when gliding and flapping, and about {{convert|48|km/h|mph|sp=us|abbr = on}} while carrying fish.&lt;ref name=&quot;Terres&quot;/&gt; Its dive speed is between {{convert|120|-|160|km/h|mph|sp=us|abbr = on}}, though it seldom dives vertically.&lt;ref name=r17/&gt; It is partially migratory, depending on location. If its territory has access to open water, it remains there year-round, but if the body of water freezes during the winter, making it impossible to obtain food, it migrates to the south or to the coast. A number of populations are subject to post-breeding dispersal, mainly in juveniles; Florida eagles, for example, will disperse northwards in the summer.&lt;ref name=r8/&gt; The bald eagle selects migration routes which take advantage of [[thermal]]s, [[updraft]]s, and food resources. During migration, it may ascend in a thermal and then glide down, or may ascend in updrafts created by the wind against a cliff or other terrain. Migration generally takes place during the daytime, usually between the local hours of 8:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., when thermals are produced by the sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADW&quot;/&gt;

===Diet and feeding===
[[File:31 White-headed Eagle.jpg|thumb|left|Bald eagle feeding on catfish and other various fishes. Painted by [[John James Audubon]].]]
The bald eagle is an opportunistic carnivore with the capacity to predate a great variety of prey. Throughout their range, [[fish]] often comprise the majority of the eagle's diet.&lt;ref name=&quot;LPZBaldEagle&quot;&gt;[http://www.lpzoo.org/animals/factsheet/bald-eagle &quot;Bald Eagle Fact Sheet, Lincoln Park Zoo&quot;]. Lpzoo.org. Retrieved on 2012-08-22.&lt;/ref&gt; In 20 food habit studies across the species' range, fish comprised 56% of the diet of nesting eagles, birds 28%, mammals 14% and other prey 2%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stalmaster&quot;&gt;Stalmaster, M. V. 1987. ''The Bald Eagle''. Universe Books, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Southeast Alaska]], fish comprise approximately 66% of the year-around diet of bald eagles and 78% of the prey brought to the nest by the parents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong&quot;/&gt; Eagles living in the [[Columbia River Estuary]] in [[Oregon]] were found to rely on fish for 90% of their dietary intake.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson2&quot;/&gt; In the [[Pacific Northwest]], spawning [[trout]] and [[salmon]] provide most of the bald eagles' diet from late summer throughout fall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alaska&quot;/&gt; Southeast Alaskan eagles largely predate [[pink salmon]] (''Oncorhynchus gorbuscha''), [[coho salmon]] (''O. kisutch'') and, more locally, [[sockeye salmon]] (''O. nerka''), with [[chinook salmon]] (''O. tshawytscha''), due to their large size ({{convert|12|to|18|kg|lb|abbr=on}} average adult size) probably being taken only as carrion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong&quot;/&gt; Also important in the estuaries and shallow coastlines of southern Alaska are [[Pacific herring]] (''Clupea pallasii''), [[sand lance|Pacific sand lance]] (''Ammodytes hexapterus'') and [[eulachon]] (''Thaleichthys pacificus'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong&quot;/&gt; In Oregon's Columbia River Estuary, the most significant prey species were [[largescale sucker]]s (''Catostomus macrocheilus'') (17.3% of the prey selected there), [[American shad]] (''Alosa sapidissima''; 13%) and [[common carp]] (''Cyprinus carpio''; 10.8%).&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson2&quot;/&gt; Eagles living in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] in [[Maryland]] were found to subsist largely on [[American gizzard shad]] (''Dorosoma cepedianum''), [[threadfin shad]] (''D. petenense'') and [[white bass]] (''Morone chrysops'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Mersmann&quot;/&gt; Floridian eagles have been reported to predate [[catfish]], mostly prevalently the [[brown bullhead]] (''Ameiurus nebulosus'') and any species in the ''[[Ictalurus]]'' genus as well as [[mullet (fish)|mullet]], [[trout]], [[needlefish]], and [[eel]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travsky&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FPL&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=j5/&gt; Wintering eagles on the [[Platte River]] in [[Nebraska]] preyed mainly on American gizzard shads and common carp.&lt;ref name=j15/&gt; From observation in the Columbia River, 58% of the fish were caught directly by the predating eagle, 24% were scavenged as carcasses and 18% were pirated away from other animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson2&quot;/&gt;

Even eagles living in relatively arid regions still typically rely primarily on fish as prey. In [[Sonora]], [[Mexico]] and [[Arizona]], 77% and over 73%, respectively, of prey remains at the nests were from fish, largely various catfish and [[rainbow trout]] (''Oncorhynchus mykiss''). Prey fish targeted by bald eagles are often quite large. When experimenters offered fish of different sizes in the breeding season around [[Lake Britton]] in [[California]], fish measuring {{convert|34|to|38|cm|in|abbr=on}} were taken 71.8% of the time by parent eagles while fish measuring {{convert|23|to|27.5|cm|in|abbr=on}} were chosen only 25% of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jenkins&quot;/&gt; At nests around [[Lake Superior]], the remains of fish (mostly [[Catostomus|suckers]]) were found to average {{convert|35.4|cm|in|abbr=on}} in total length.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kozie&quot;/&gt; In the Columbia River estuary, most predated by eagles were estimated to measure between {{convert|30|and|60|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length, and carp flown with (laboriously) were up to {{convert|86|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watson2&quot;/&gt;

[[Benthic zone|Benthic fishes]] such as catfish are usually consumed after they die and float to the surface, though while temporarily swimming in the open may be more vulnerable to predation than most fish since their eyes focus downwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mersmann&quot;/&gt; Bald eagles also regularly exploit water turbines which produce battered, stunned or dead fish easily consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper |last=Delong |first=D. C., Jr. |year=1990 |title=Effects of food on Bald Eagle distribution and abundance on the northern Chesapeake Bay: an experimental approach |work=Master's Thesis |publisher=Virginia Polytechnic Inst. and State Univ |location=Blacksburg }}&lt;/ref&gt; Predators who leave behind scraps of dead fish that they kill, such as [[brown bear]]s (''Ursus arctos''), [[Gray wolf|gray wolves]] (''Canis lupus'') and [[red fox]]es (''Vulpes vulpes''), may be habitually followed in order to scavenge the kills secondarily.&lt;ref name=&quot;Armstrong&quot;/&gt; Once North Pacific salmon die off after spawning, usually local bald eagles eat salmon carcasses almost exclusively. Eagles in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] need to consume {{convert|489|g|lb|abbr=on}} of fish each day for survival, with adults generally consuming more than juveniles and thus reducing potential energy deficiency and increasing survival during winter.&lt;ref name=Stalmaster/&gt;

Behind fish, the next most significant prey base for bald eagles are other [[Water bird|waterbirds]]. The contribution of such birds to the eagle's diet is variable, depending on the quantity and availability of fish near the water's surface.

Along some portions of the [[North Pacific]] coastline, bald eagles which had historically predated mainly [[kelp]]-dwelling fish and supplementally [[sea otter]] (''Enhydra lutris'') pups are now preying mainly on seabird colonies since both the fish (possibly due to overfishing) and otters (cause unknown) have had precipitious population declines, causing concern for seabird conservation.&lt;ref name=&quot;sciencedaily&quot;/&gt; Because of this more extensive predation, some biologist have expressed concern that [[murre]]s are heading for a &quot;conservation collision&quot; due to heavy eagle predation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Henderson&quot;/&gt; Eagles have been confirmed to attack nocturnally active, burrow-nesting seabird species such as [[storm petrel]]s and [[shearwater]]s by digging out their burrows and feeding on all animals they find inside.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nocturnal&quot;/&gt; If a bald eagle flies close by, waterbirds will often fly away en masse, though in other cases they may seemingly ignore a perched eagle.

It may swim to safety, but some eagles drown or succumb to [[hypothermia]]. Many sources claim that bald eagles, like all large eagles, cannot normally take flight carrying prey more than half of their own weight unless aided by favorable wind conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;FPL&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gill&quot;/&gt; On numerous occasions, when large prey such as mature salmon or geese are attacked, eagles have been seen to make contact and then drag the prey in a strenuously labored, low flight over the water to a bank, where they then finish off and dismember the prey.&lt;ref name=&quot;BNA&quot;/&gt; When food is abundant, an eagle can gorge itself by storing up to {{convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of food in a pouch in the throat called a crop. Gorging allows the bird to fast for several days if food becomes unavailable.&lt;ref name=&quot;FPL&quot;/&gt; Occasionally, bald eagles may hunt cooperatively when confronting prey, especially relatively large prey such as jackrabbits or herons, with one bird distracting potential prey, while the other comes behind it in order to ambush it.&lt;ref name= Cornell/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, C. C. 1969. ''Winter behavior and population dynamics of American eagles in Utah''. Phd Thesis. Brigham Young University. Provo, UT.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=j25/&gt; While hunting waterfowl, bald eagles repeatedly fly at a target and cause it to dive repeatedly, hoping to exhaust the victim so it can be caught (white-tailed eagles have been recorded hunting waterfowl in the same way).

Unlike some other eagle species, bald eagles rarely take on evasive or dangerous prey on their own.

Due to their dietary habits, bald eagles are frequently viewed in a negative light by humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travsky&quot;/&gt; Thanks to their superior foraging ability and experience, adults are generally more likely to hunt live prey than immature eagles, which often obtain their food from scavenging.&lt;ref name=&quot;Todd&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harmata, A. R. 1984. ''Bald Eagles of the San Luis valley, Colorado: their winter ecology and spring migration''. Phd Thesis. Montana State University. Bozeman.&lt;/ref&gt; They are not very selective about the condition or origin, whether provided by humans, other animals, auto accidents or natural causes, of a carcass's presence, but will avoid eating carrion where disturbances from humans are a regular occurrence. They will scavenge carcasses up to the size of [[whale]]s, though carcasses of [[ungulate]]s and large [[fish]] are seemingly preferred.&lt;ref name=&quot;BNA&quot;/&gt; Bald eagles also may sometimes feed on subsistence scavenged or stolen from campsites and picnics, as well as garbage dumps (dump usage is habitual mainly in Alaska).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherrod&quot;/&gt;

When competing for food, eagles will usually dominate other fish-eaters and scavengers, aggressively displacing [[mammal]]s such as [[coyote]]s (''Canis latrans'') and [[fox]]es, and birds such as [[corvid]]s, [[gull]]s, [[vulture]]s and other [[Bird of prey|raptor]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherrod&quot;/&gt; Occasionally, coyotes, [[bobcat]]s (''Lynx rufus'') and [[Dog|domestic dogs]] (''Canis lupus familiaris'') can displace eagles from carrion, usually less confident immature birds, as has been recorded in Maine.&lt;ref name=j14/&gt; Bald eagles are less active, bold predators than golden eagles and get relatively more of their food as carrion and from kleptoparasitism (although it is now generally thought that golden eagles eat more carrion than was previously assumed).&lt;ref name= Watson/&gt; However, the two species are roughly equal in size, aggressiveness and physical strength and so competitions can go either way.

===Reproduction===
Bald eagles are sexually mature at four or five years of age. When they are old enough to breed, they often return to the area where they were born. It is thought that bald eagles [[mate for life]]. However, if one member of a pair dies or disappears, the other will choose a new mate. A pair which has repeatedly failed in breeding attempts may split and look for new mates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hinterland&quot;/&gt; Bald eagle courtship involves elaborate, spectacular calls and flight displays. The flight includes swoops, chases, and cartwheels, in which they fly high, lock talons, and free fall, separating just before hitting the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stalmaster&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=r7/&gt; Usually, a territory defended by a mature pair will be {{convert|1|to|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} of waterside habitat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travsky&quot;/&gt;

Compared to most other raptors which mostly nest in April or May, bald eagles are early breeders: nest building or reinforcing is often by mid-February, egg laying is often late February (sometimes during deep snow in the North), and incubation is usually mid-March and early May. Eggs hatch from mid April to early May, and the young fledge late June to early July.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travsky&quot;/&gt; The nest is the largest of any bird in North America; it is used repeatedly over many years and with new material added each year may eventually be as large as {{convert|4|m|ft|sp=us|abbr = on}} deep, {{convert|2.5|m|ft|sp=us|abbr = on}} across and weigh {{convert|1|t|ST|lk=on|sp=us}};&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt; one nest in Florida was found to be {{convert|6.1|m|ft|sp=us|abbr = on}} deep, {{convert|2.9|m|ft|sp=us}} across, and to weigh {{convert|3|ST|t|1|sp=us|abbr = off}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Erickson, L. |year=2007 |publisher=Journey North |url=http://www.learner.org/jnorth/tm/eagle/NestAbout1.html |title=Bald Eagle, About Bald Eagle Nests}}&lt;/ref&gt; This nest is on record as the largest tree nest ever recorded for any animal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trails.com/arts/amazing-bird-records.aspx Amazing Bird Records].

However, one nest in the [[Midwest]] was occupied continuously for at least 34 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;FPL&quot;/&gt; The nest is built out of branches, usually in large trees found near water. When breeding where there are no trees, the bald eagle will nest on the ground, as has been recorded largely in areas largely isolated from terrestrial predators, such as Amchitka Island in Alaska.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherrod&quot;/&gt; In [[Sonora]], [[Mexico]], eagles have been observed nesting on top of [[Pachycereus pecten-aboriginum|Hecho catcuses]] (''Pachycereus pectinaboriginum'').&lt;ref name=j9/&gt; Nests located on cliffs and rock pinnacles have been reported historically in [[California]], [[Kansas]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]] and [[Utah]], but currently are only verified to occur only in [[Alaska]] and [[Arizona]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Travsky&quot;/&gt; The eggs average about {{convert|73|mm|in|sp=us|abbr = on}} long, ranging from {{convert|58|to|85|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and have a breadth of {{convert|54|mm|in|sp=us|abbr = on}}, ranging from {{convert|47|to|63|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Terres&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stalmaster&quot;/&gt; Eggs in Alaska averaged {{convert|130|g|oz|abbr=on}} in mass, while in [[Saskatchewan]] they averaged {{convert|114.4|g|oz|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hensel, R. J 1964&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bortolotti&quot;/&gt; As with their ultimate body size, egg size tends to increase further away from the Equator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stalmaster&quot;/&gt; Eagles produce between one and three eggs per year, two being typical. Rarely, four eggs have been found in nests but these may be exceptional cases of [[polygyny]].&lt;ref name=bent/&gt; Eagles in captivity have been capable of producing up to seven eggs.&lt;ref name=j10/&gt; it is rare for all three chicks to successfully reach the fledging stage. The oldest chick often bear the advantage of larger size and louder voice, which tends to draw the parents attention towards them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travsky&quot;/&gt; Occasionally, as is recorded in many large raptorial birds, the oldest sibling sometimes attacks and kills their younger sibling(s), especially early in the nesting period when their sizes are most different.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travsky&quot;/&gt; However, nearly half of known bald eagle produce two fledgings species (more rarely three), unlike in some other &quot;eagle&quot; species such as some in the ''Aquila'' genus, in which a second fledging is typically observed in less than 20% of nests despite two eggs being typically laid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;/&gt; Both the male and female take turns incubating the eggs, but the female does most of the incubation. The parent not incubating will hunt for food or look for nesting material during this stage. For the first two to three weeks of the nestling period at least one adult is at the nest almost 100% of the time. After five to six weeks, the attendance of parents usually drops off considerably (with the parents often perching in trees nearby).&lt;ref name=&quot;Travsky&quot;/&gt; A young eaglet can gain up to {{convert|170|g|oz|abbr=on}} a day, the fastest growth rate of any North American bird.&lt;ref name=&quot;FPL&quot;/&gt; The young eaglets pick up and manipulate sticks, play tug of war with each other, practice holding things in their talons, and stretch and flap their wings. By eight weeks, the eaglets are strong enough to flap their wings, lift their feet off the nest platform, and rise up in the air.&lt;ref name=&quot;FPL&quot;/&gt; The young fledge at anywhere from 8 to 14 weeks of age, though will remain close to the nest and attended to by their parents for a further 6 weeks. Juvenile eagles first start dispersing away from their parents about 8 weeks after they fledge. Variability in departure date related to effects of sex and hatching order on growth and development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bortolotti&quot;/&gt; For the next four years, immature eagles wander widely in search of food until they attain adult plumage and are eligible to reproduce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drexel&quot;/&gt;

===Longevity and mortality===
[[File:Fledging Bald Eagle.jpg|thumb|Newly fledged juvenile]]
The average lifespan of bald eagles in the wild is around 20 years, with the oldest confirmed one having been 28 years of age.&lt;ref name= Cornell/&gt; In captivity, they often live somewhat longer. In one instance, a captive individual in [[New York]] lived for nearly 50 years. As with size, the average lifespan of an eagle population appears to be influenced by its location and access to prey.&lt;ref name=sop&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bsc-eoc.org/regional/oneaglefacts.html|title=Bald Eagle Fact Sheet|publisher=Southern Ontario Bald Eagle Monitoring Project|accessdate= 2008-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As they are no longer heavily persecuted, adult mortality is quite low. In one study of Florida eagles, adult bald eagles reportedly had 100% annual survival rate.&lt;ref name= Watson/&gt; In [[Prince William Sound]] in [[Alaska]], adults had an annual survival rate of 88% even after the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]] adversely effected eagles in the area.&lt;ref name=j16/&gt; Of 1,428 individuals from across the range necropsied by National Wildlife Health Center from 1963 to 1984, 329 (23%) eagles died from trauma, primarily impact with wires and vehicles; 309 (22%) died from gunshot; 158 (11%) died from poisoning; 130 (9%) died from electrocution; 68 (5%) died from trapping; 110 (8%) from emaciation; and 31 (2%) from disease; cause of death was undetermined in 293 (20%) of cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buehler&quot;/&gt; In this study, 68% of mortality was human-caused.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buehler&quot; /&gt; Today eagle-shooting is believed to be considerably reduced due to the species protected status.&lt;ref name=b6/&gt; In one case, an adult eagle investigating a peregrine falcon nest for prey items sustained a concussion from a swooping parent peregrine, and ultimately died days later from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bna.birds.cornell.edu/bna/species/660/articles/behavior |title=Cornell University |publisher=Bna.birds.cornell.edu|accessdate=2010-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early natural history video depicts a [[cougar]] (''Puma concolor'') ambushing and killing an immature bald eagle feeding at a rabbit carcass is viewable online although this film may have been staged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=//www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4Yx1KXQMCM |title=Cougar vs Eagle |publisher=YouTube.com |accessdate=2013-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most non-human-related mortality involves nestlings or eggs. Around 50% of eagles survive their first year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drexel&quot;/&gt; However, in the Chesapeake Bay area, 100% of 39 radio-tagged nestlings survived to their first year.&lt;ref name=j24/&gt; Occasionally, nestling or egg fatalities are due to nest collapses, starvation, sibling aggression or inclement weather. Another significant cause of egg and nestling mortality is predation. These have been verified to be predated by large [[gull]]s, [[corvid]]s (including [[raven]]s, [[Corvus (genus)|crow]]s and [[magpie]]s), [[Wolverine]]s (''Gulo gulo''), [[hawk]]s, [[owl]]s, [[eagle]]s, [[bobcat]]s (''Lynx rufus''), [[American black bear]]s (''Ursus americanus'') and [[raccoon]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hensel, R.

==Relationship with humans==

===Population decline and recovery===
Once a common sight in much of the continent, the bald eagle was severely affected in the mid-20th century by a variety of factors, among them the thinning of egg shells attributed to use of the pesticide [[DDT]].&lt;ref name=b5/&gt; Bald eagles, like many birds of prey, were especially affected by DDT due to [[biomagnification]]. DDT itself was not lethal to the adult bird, but it interfered with the bird's [[calcium]] metabolism, making the bird either sterile or unable to lay healthy eggs. Female eagles laid eggs that were too brittle to withstand the weight of a brooding adult, making it nearly impossible for the eggs to hatch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bull87&quot;/&gt; It is estimated that in the early 18th century, the bald eagle population was 300,000–500,000,&lt;ref name=r16/&gt; but by the 1950s there were only 412 nesting pairs in the 48 [[Contiguous United States|contiguous states]] of the US.
Other factors in bald eagle population reductions were a widespread loss of suitable habitat, as well as both legal and illegal shooting. In 1930 a New York City ornithologist wrote that in the state of Alaska in the previous 12 years approximately 70,000 bald eagles had been shot. Many of the hunters killed the bald eagles under the long-held beliefs that bald eagles grabbed young lambs and even children with their talons, yet the birds were innocent of most of these alleged acts of predation (lamb predation is rare, human predation is thought to be non-existent).&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=HCoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA62 &quot;American Bald Eagle Is Near Extinction.&quot;] ''Popular Science Monthly'', March 1930, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Later illegal shooting was described as &quot;the leading cause of direct mortality in both adult and immature bald eagles,&quot; according to a 1978 report in the Endangered Species Technical Bulletin. In 1984, the [[National Wildlife Federation]] listed hunting, power-line electrocution, and collisions in flight as the leading causes of eagle deaths. Bald eagles have also been killed by oil, lead, and mercury pollution, and by human and predator intrusion at nests.&lt;ref name=r15/&gt;

The species was first protected in the U.S. and Canada by the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918|1918 Migratory Bird Treaty]], later extended to all of North America. The 1940 bald eagle Protection Act in the U.S., which protected the bald eagle and the [[golden eagle]], prohibited commercial trapping and killing of the birds. The bald eagle was declared an endangered species in the U.S. in 1967, and amendments to the 1940 act between 1962 and 1972 further restricted commercial uses and increased penalties for violators. Perhaps most significant in the species' recovery, in 1972, DDT was banned from usage in the United States.&lt;ref name=r13/&gt; DDT was completely banned in Canada in 1989, though its use had been highly restricted since the late 1970s.&lt;ref name=r14/&gt;
[[File:Haliaeetus leucocephalus 38319.JPG|thumb|upright|First-year]]

With regulations in place and DDT banned, the eagle population rebounded. The bald eagle can be found in growing concentrations throughout the United States and Canada, particularly near large bodies of water. In the early 1980s, the estimated total population was 100,000 individuals, with 110,000–115,000 by 1992;&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt; the [[U.S. state]] with the largest resident population is [[Alaska]], with about 40,000–50,000, with the next highest population the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian province]] of [[British Columbia]] with 20,000–30,000 in 1992.&lt;ref name=hbw/&gt; Obtaining a precise count of bald eagles population is extremely difficult. The most recent data submitted by individual states was in 2006, when 9789 breeding pairs were reported.&lt;ref name=&quot;USFWS2013&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/midwest/eagle/population/chtofprs.html |title=Bald Eagle Breeding Pairs 1963 to 2006 |date=March 18, 2013 |accessdate=December 10, 2013 |publisher=U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some time, the stronghold breeding population of bald eagles in the lower 48 states was in [[Florida]], where over a thousand pairs have held on while populations in other states were significantly reduced by DDT use. Today, the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous state]] with the largest number of breeding pairs of eagles is [[Minnesota]] with an estimated 1,312 pairs, surpassing Florida's most recent count of 1,166 pairs. 23, or nearly half, of the 48 contiguous states now have at least 100 breeding pairs of bald eagles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot;/&gt;

The bald eagle was officially removed from the U.S. federal government's list of endangered species on July 12, 1995, by the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, when it was reclassified from &quot;Endangered&quot; to &quot;Threatened.&quot; On July 6, 1999, a proposal was initiated &quot;To Remove the Bald Eagle in the Lower 48 States From the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife.&quot; It was de-listed on June 28, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =Bald Eagle Soars Off Endangered Species List | publisher =U.S. Department of the Interior | date =2007-06-28 | url =http://www.doi.gov/news/07_News_Releases/070628.html| accessdate =2007-08-27| archiveurl = //web.archive.org/web/20070713141429/http://www.doi.gov/news/07_News_Releases/070628.html| archivedate = July 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been assigned a risk level of [[Least Concern]] category on the [[IUCN Red List]].&lt;ref name=IUCN/&gt; In the [[Exxon Valdez Oil Spill]] of 1989 an estimated 247 were killed in [[Prince William Sound]], though the local population returned to its pre-spill level by 1995.&lt;ref name= Cornell/&gt;

===In captivity===
[[License|Permits]] are required to keep bald eagles in captivity in the United States. Permits are primarily issued to public educational institutions, and the eagles which they show are permanently injured individuals which cannot be released to the wild. The facilities where eagles are kept must be equipped with adequate caging and facilities, as well as workers experienced in the handling and care of eagles. Bald eagles cannot legally be kept for [[falconry]] in the United States. As a rule, the bald eagle is a poor choice for public shows, being timid, prone to becoming highly stressed, and unpredictable in nature. Native American tribes can obtain a &quot;Native American Religious Use&quot; permit to keep non-releasable eagles as well. They use their naturally molted feathers for religious and cultural ceremonies. The bald eagle can be long-lived in captivity if well cared for, but does not breed well even under the best conditions.&lt;ref name=j11/&gt; In Canada, a license is required to keep bald eagles for [[falconry]].&lt;ref name=r12/&gt;

==Cultural significance==
[[File:Haliaeetus leucocephalus -Skagit valley-8-2c.jpg|thumb|upright|In [[Skagit Valley]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], United States]]
The bald eagle is important in various [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures and, as the [[national symbol|national bird]] of the [[United States]], is prominent in seals and logos, coinage, postage stamps, and other items relating to the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]].

===Role in Native American culture===
The bald eagle is a sacred bird in some North American cultures, and its feathers, like those of the [[golden eagle]], are central to many religious and [[Native American mythology|spiritual]] customs among [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]. Eagles are considered spiritual messengers between gods and humans by some cultures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pequot&quot;/&gt; Many [[pow wow]] dancers use the eagle claw as part of their regalia as well. Eagle feathers are often used in traditional ceremonies, particularly in the construction of regalia worn and as a part of fans, bustles and head dresses. The [[Lakota people|Lakota]], for instance, give an eagle feather as a symbol of honor to person who achieves a task. In modern times, it may be given on an event such as a graduation from college.&lt;ref name=&quot;Melmer&quot;/&gt; The [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] considered eagles as symbols of fertility because their nests are built high off the ground and because they fiercely protect their young.&lt;ref name=&quot;northeast&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fws.gov/northeast/newsroom/eagle.html|title=Bald Eagle Population Recovery and the Endangered Species Act|publisher=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|accessdate=2014-11-22|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6UGYq5AFv|archivedate=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Choctaw]] considered the bald eagle, who has direct contact with the upper world of the sun, as a symbol of peace.&lt;ref name=greg_obrien_eagle/&gt;

[[File:National eagle repository 017.JPG|left|thumb|Staff at the [[National Eagle Repository]] processing a bald eagle.]]
During the [[Sun Dance]], which is practiced by many [[Plains Indian]] tribes, the eagle is represented in several ways. The eagle nest is represented by the fork of the lodge where the dance is held. A whistle made from the wing bone of an eagle is used during the course of the dance. Also during the dance, a [[medicine man]] may direct his fan, which is made of eagle feathers, to people who seek to be healed. The medicine man touches the fan to the center pole and then to the patient, in order to transmit power from the pole to the patient. The fan is then held up toward the sky, so that the eagle may carry the prayers for the sick to the Creator.&lt;ref name=r11/&gt;

Current [[eagle feather law]] stipulates that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain or possess bald or golden eagle feathers for religious or spiritual use. The constitutionality of these laws has been questioned by Native American groups on the basis that it violates the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] by affecting ability to practice their religion freely.&lt;ref name=r9/&gt;&lt;ref name=r10/&gt;

The [[National Eagle Repository]], a division of the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|FWS]], exists as a means to receive, process, and store bald and [[golden eagle]]s which are found dead, and to distribute the eagles, their parts and feathers, to [[List of federally recognized tribes|federally recognized]] Native American tribes for use in religious ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov/le/national-eagle-repository.html |title=U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement / Native Americans and Alaskan Natives - National Eagle Repository |accessdate=10 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National bird of the United States===
[[File:Seal of the President of the United States.svg|thumb|upright|[[Seal of the President of the United States]]]]
The bald eagle is the national bird of the [[United States of America]].&lt;ref name=j23/&gt; The founders of the United States were fond of comparing their new republic with the [[Roman Republic]], in which eagle imagery (usually involving the golden eagle) was prominent. On June 20, 1782, the [[Continental Congress]] adopted the still-current design for the [[Great Seal of the United States]] including a bald eagle grasping 13 [[arrow]]s and a 13-leaf [[olive branch]] with its talons.&lt;ref name=&quot;seal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;seal2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;seal3&quot;/&gt;

The bald eagle appears on most official seals of the U.S. government, including the [[Seal of the President of the United States|presidential seal]], the [[Flag of the President of the United States|presidential flag]], and in the [[logo]]s of many U.S. federal agencies. Between 1916 and 1945, the presidential flag (but not the seal) showed an eagle facing to its left (the viewer's right), which gave rise to the [[urban legend]] that the flag is changed to have the eagle face towards the olive branch in peace, and towards the arrows in wartime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/history/american/turnhead.htm |title=A Turn of the Head|accessdate=2007-08-19|author= Mikkelson, Barbara and Mikkelson, David P |publisher=snopes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to popular legend, there is no evidence that [[Benjamin Franklin]] ever publicly supported the [[wild turkey]] (''Meleagris gallopavo''), rather than the bald eagle, as a symbol of the United States. However, in a letter written to his daughter in 1784 from Paris, criticizing the [[Society of the Cincinnati]], he stated his personal distaste for the bald eagle's behavior. In the letter Franklin states:&lt;ref name= Cornell&gt;[http://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/bald_eagle/lifehistory Bald Eagle, Life History, All About Birds – Cornell Lab of Ornithology]. Allaboutbirds.org. Retrieved on 2012-08-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

''{{quote|For my own part. I wish the bald eagle had not been chosen the representative of our country. He is a bird of bad moral character. He does not get his living honestly&amp;nbsp;... besides he is a rank coward: The little [[Eastern kingbird|king bird]] not bigger than a sparrow attacks him boldly and drives him out of the district.}}''

Franklin opposed the creation of the Society because he viewed it, with its hereditary membership, as a [[order (decoration)|noble order]] unwelcome in the newly independent [[Republic]], contrary to the ideals of [[Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus]], for whom the Society was named; his reference to the two kinds of birds is interpreted as a satirical comparison between the Society of the Cincinnati and Cincinnatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanheraldry.org/pages/index.php?n=MMM.Turkey |title=American Heraldry Society &amp;#124; MMM / The Arms of the United States: Benjamin Franklin and the Turkey |publisher=Americanheraldry.org |date=2007-05-18 |accessdate=2010-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
