It is named after [[André-Marie Ampère]] (1775–1836), French mathematician and physicist, considered the father of [[electrodynamics]].

In practical terms, the ampere is a measure of the amount of [[electric charge]] passing a point in an electric circuit per unit time, with an equivalent charge to {{val|6.241|e=18}} electrons (or one [[coulomb]]) per second constituting one ampere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = David Bodanis| last = Bodanis | first = David | year = 2005 | title = Electric Universe | place = New York | publisher = Three Rivers Press | ISBN = 978-0-307-33598-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ampere is a measure of flow rate of electric charge. If we increase the number of charged particles, the charge on the particles, or the speed at which the particles are moving past a specified point, the amperes at that point will also increase.

The [[SI]] unit of charge, the [[coulomb]], &quot;is the quantity of electricity carried in 1 second by a current of 1 ampere&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = [[Bureau International des Poids et Mesures]] | year = 2006 | url = http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf | title = The International System of Units (SI) | edition = 8th | page = 144 | format = PDF}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a current of one ampere is one coulomb of charge going past a given point per second:
:&lt;math&gt;\rm 1\ A=1\tfrac C s.&lt;/math&gt;
In general, charge ''Q'' is determined by steady current ''I'' flowing for a time ''t'' as ''Q'' = ''It''.

== History ==
The ampere was originally defined as one tenth of the [[Centimetre gram second system of units|CGS system]] electromagnetic unit of current (now known as the [[abampere]]), the amount of current that generates a force of two [[dyne]]s per centimetre of length between two wires one centimetre apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://alpha.montclair.edu/~kowalskiL/SI/SI_PAGE.HTML | title = A short history of the SI units in electricity | publisher = Montclair | last = Kowalski | first = L}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The size of the unit was chosen so that the units derived from it in the [[International System of Units|MKSA system]] would be conveniently sized.

The &quot;international ampere&quot; was an early realization of the ampere, defined as the current that would deposit {{val|fmt=commas|0.001118000}} grams of silver per second from a [[silver nitrate]] solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.sizes.com/units/ampHist.htm | title = History of the ampere | publisher = Sizes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, more accurate measurements revealed that this current is 0.99985&amp;nbsp;A.

== Realization ==
The standard ampere is most accurately realized using a [[watt balance]], but is in practice maintained via [[Ohm's law]] from the units of [[electromotive force]] and [[electrical resistance|resistance]], the [[volt]] and the [[ohm]], since the latter two can be tied to physical phenomena that are relatively easy to reproduce, the [[Josephson junction]] and the [[quantum Hall effect]], respectively.&lt;ref name = &quot;Electrical quantities&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/appendix2/electrical.html | title = SI brochure | chapter = Appendix 2: Practical realization of unit definitions: Electrical quantities | publisher = BIPM}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, techniques to establish the realization of an ampere have a [[relative uncertainty]] of approximately a few parts in 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, and involve realizations of the watt, the ohm and the volt.&lt;ref name= &quot;Electrical quantities&quot; /&gt;

== Proposed future definition ==
{{Main|New SI definitions}}
Rather than a definition in terms of the force between two current-carrying wires, it has been proposed to define the ampere in terms of the rate of flow of elementary charges.&lt;ref name = &quot;Beyond&quot; /&gt;  Since a [[coulomb]] is approximately equal to {{val |6.2415093|e=18}} [[elementary charge]]s (such as [[electron]]s), one ampere is approximately equivalent to {{val|fmt=commas|6.2415093|e=18}} elementary charges moving past a boundary in one second, or the reciprocal of the value of the elementary charges in coulombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?e | publisher = NIST | place = USA | title = Physics | contribution = Value}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed change would define 1 A as being the current in the direction of flow of a particular number of elementary charges per second. In 2005, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) agreed to study the proposed change. The [[New SI definitions|new definition]] is expected to be formally proposed at the 25th [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]] (CGPM) in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

== Everyday examples ==
{{main|Orders of magnitude (current)}}
The current drawn by typical constant-voltage energy distribution systems is usually dictated by the power ([[watt]]s) consumed by the system and the operating voltage. For this reason the examples given below are grouped by voltage level.

=== Portable gadgets ===
*Hearing aid (typically 1&amp;nbsp;mW at 1.4&amp;nbsp;V): 0.7&amp;nbsp;mA

=== Motor vehicles – 12 V DC ===
A typical motor vehicle has a 12&amp;nbsp;V battery. The various accessories that are powered by the battery might include:
*Instrument panel light (typically 2&amp;nbsp;W): 166&amp;nbsp;mA.
*Headlights (typically 60&amp;nbsp;W): 5&amp;nbsp;A each.
*Starter Motor (typically 1–2&amp;nbsp;kW): 80-160&amp;nbsp;A

=== North American domestic supply – 120 V AC ===
Most United States, Canada and Mexico domestic power suppliers run at 120&amp;nbsp;V.

Household [[circuit breaker]]s typically provide a maximum of 15&amp;nbsp;A or 20&amp;nbsp;A of current to a given set of outlets.
*22-inch/56-centimeter portable television (35&amp;nbsp;W): 290&amp;nbsp;mA
*Tungsten light bulb (60–100&amp;nbsp;W): 500–830&amp;nbsp;mA
*Toaster, kettle (1.5 kW): 12.5 A
*Hair dryer (1.8 kW): 15 A

=== European &amp; Commonwealth domestic supply – 230-240 V AC ===
Most European domestic power supplies run at 230&amp;nbsp;V, and most Commonwealth domestic power supplies run at 240&amp;nbsp;V. For the same amount of power (in watts), the current drawn by a particular European or Commonwealth appliance (in Europe or a Commonwealth country) will be less than for an equivalent North American appliance.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;The formula for power is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
P(t) = I(t) \cdot V(t) \,
&lt;/math&gt;
so it follows that if the voltage is doubled and the power remains the same, the current will be halved.&lt;/ref&gt; Typical circuit breakers will provide 16&amp;nbsp;A.

The current drawn by a number of typical appliances are:
*22-inch/56-centimeter Portable Television (35&amp;nbsp;W): 145–150&amp;nbsp;mA
*Tungsten light bulb (60–100&amp;nbsp;W): 240–450&amp;nbsp;mA
*Compact Fluorescent Lamp (11–30&amp;nbsp;W): 56–112&amp;nbsp;mA
*Toaster, kettle (2&amp;nbsp;kW): 9&amp;nbsp;A
*Immersion heater (4.6&amp;nbsp;kW): 19-20&amp;nbsp;A
