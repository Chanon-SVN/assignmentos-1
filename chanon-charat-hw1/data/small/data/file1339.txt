'''Acceleration''', in [[physics]], is the [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]] of change of [[velocity]] of an object. An object's acceleration is the net result of any and all [[force]]s acting on the object, as described by [[Newton's Second Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Principles of Mechanics |first=Henry |last=Crew |publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC |year=2008 |isbn=0-559-36871-2 |pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit for acceleration is the [[metre per second squared]] (m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Accelerations are [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantities (they have [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and [[Direction (geometry)|direction]]) and add according to the [[parallelogram law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Relativity and Common Sense |first=Hermann |last=Bondi |pages=3 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1980 |isbn=0-486-24021-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Physics the Easy Way |pages=27 |first=Robert L. |last=Lehrman |publisher=Barron's Educational Series |year=1998 |isbn=0-7641-0236-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a [[Vector space|vector]], the calculated net [[force]] is equal to the product of the object's mass (a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity) and the acceleration.

For example, when a car starts from a standstill (zero relative velocity) and travels in a straight line at increasing speeds, it is accelerating in the direction of travel. If the car turns there is an acceleration toward the new direction. For this example, we can call the accelerating of the car forward a &quot;linear acceleration&quot;, which passengers in the car might experience as force pushing them back into their seats. When changing directions, we might call this &quot;non-linear acceleration&quot;, which passengers might experience as a sideways force. If the speed of the car decreases, this is an acceleration in the opposite direction of the direction of the vehicle, sometimes called '''deceleration'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Raymond A. Serway, Chris Vuille, Jerry S. Faughn |title=College Physics, Volume 10 |year=2008 |publisher=Cengage |isbn=9780495386933 |page=32 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CX0u0mIOZ44C&amp;pg=PA32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passengers may experience deceleration as a force lifting them away from their seats.  Mathematically, there is no separate formula for deceleration, as both are changes in velocity. Each of these accelerations (linear, non-linear, deceleration) might be felt by passengers until their velocity and direction match that of the car.

== Definition and properties ==

===Average acceleration===
[[File:Acceleration as derivative of velocity along trajectory.svg|right|thumb|220px|Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. At any point on a trajectory, the magnitude of the acceleration is given by the rate of change of velocity in both magnitude and direction at that point. The true acceleration at time ''t'' is found in the limit as [[time interval]] ''Δt'' → 0 of ''Δ'''''v'''/''Δt'']]

An object's average acceleration over a period of [[time in physics|time]] is its change in [[velocity]] &lt;math&gt;( \Delta \mathbf{v})&lt;/math&gt; divided by the duration of the period &lt;math&gt;( \Delta t)&lt;/math&gt;. Mathematically,

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\bar{a}} = \frac{\Delta \mathbf{v}}{\Delta t}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Instantaneous acceleration===
[[File:1-D kinematics.svg|thumb|250px|right|'''From bottom to top''': {{bulleted list
 | an acceleration function ''a''(''t'');
 | the integral of the acceleration is the velocity function ''v''(''t'');
 | and the integral of the velocity is the distance function ''s''(''t'').
}}]]
Instantaneous acceleration, meanwhile, is the [[limit of a function|limit]] of the average acceleration over an [[infinitesimal]] interval of time. In the terms of [[calculus]], instantaneous acceleration is the [[derivative]] of the velocity vector with respect to time:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \lim_{{\Delta t}\to 0} \frac{\Delta \mathbf{v}}{\Delta t} = \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

(Here and elsewhere, if [[Rectilinear motion|motion is in a straight line]], [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantities can be substituted by [[Scalar (physics)|scalars]] in the equations.)

It can be seen that the [[integral]] of the acceleration function {{math|''a''(''t'')}} is the velocity function {{math|''v''(''t'')}}; that is, the area under the curve of an acceleration vs. time ({{math|''a''}} vs. {{math|''t''}}) graph corresponds to velocity.

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} =  \int \mathbf{a} \  d\mathit{t}&lt;/math&gt;

Given the fact that acceleration is defined as the derivative of velocity, {{math|'''''v'''''}}, with respect to time {{math|''t''}} and velocity is defined as the derivative of position, {{math|'''''x'''''}}, with respect to time, acceleration can be thought of as the [[second derivative]] of {{math|'''''x'''''}} with respect to {{math|''t''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} =  \frac{d\mathbf{v}}{dt} = \frac{d^2\boldsymbol{x}}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===Units===
Acceleration has the [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]] of velocity (L/T) divided by time, i.e., [[length|L]]/[[time|T]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of acceleration is the [[metre per second squared]] (m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;); this can be called more meaningfully &quot;metre per second per second&quot;, as the velocity in metres per second changes by the acceleration value, every second.

===Other forms===
An object moving in a circular motion&amp;mdash;such as a satellite orbiting the earth&amp;mdash;is accelerating due to the change of direction of motion, although the magnitude (speed) may be constant. When an object is executing such a motion where it changes direction, but not speed, it is said to be undergoing ''centripetal'' (directed towards the center) acceleration. Oppositely, a change in the speed of an object, but not its direction of motion, is a ''tangential'' acceleration.

[[Proper acceleration]], the acceleration of a body relative to a free-fall condition, is measured by an instrument called an [[accelerometer]].

In [[classical mechanics]], for a body with constant mass, the (vector) acceleration of the body's center of mass is proportional to the net [[force]] vector (i.e., sum of all forces) acting on it ([[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's second law]]):
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m\mathbf{a} \quad \to \quad \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{F}/m&lt;/math&gt;
where '''F''' is the net force acting on the body, ''m'' is  the [[mass]] of the body, and '''a''' is the center-of-mass acceleration. As speeds approach the [[speed of light]], [[Special relativity|relativistic effects]] become increasingly large and acceleration becomes less.

== Tangential and centripetal acceleration ==
[[File:Oscillating pendulum.gif|thumb|left|An oscillating pendulum, with velocity and acceleration marked. It experiences both tangential and centripetal acceleration.]]
[[File:Acceleration components.JPG|right|thumb|220px|Components of acceleration for a curved motion. The tangential component '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' is due to the change in speed of traversal, and points along the curve in the direction of the velocity vector (or in the opposite direction). The normal component (also called centripetal component for circular motion) '''a'''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' is due to the change in direction of the velocity vector and is normal to the trajectory, pointing toward the center of curvature of the path.]]
{{see also|Centripetal force#Local coordinates|l1=Local coordinates}}

The velocity of a particle moving on a curved path as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of time can be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} (t) =v(t) \frac {\mathbf{v}(t)}{v(t)} = v(t) \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}(t) , &lt;/math&gt;

with ''v''(''t'') equal to the speed of travel along the path, and

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t} = \frac {\mathbf{v}(t)}{v(t)} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

a [[Differential geometry of curves#Tangent vector|unit vector tangent]] to the path pointing in the direction of motion at the chosen moment in time. Taking into account both the changing speed ''v(t)'' and the changing direction of '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;''t''&lt;/sub&gt;, the acceleration of a particle moving on a curved path can be written using the [[chain rule]] of differentiation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ChainRule.html|title= Chain Rule}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the product of two functions of time as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{alignat}{3}
\mathbf{a} &amp; = \frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t} \\
           &amp; =  \frac{\mathrm{d}v }{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t} +v(t)\frac{d \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}}{dt} \\
           &amp; = \frac{\mathrm{d}v }{\mathrm{d}t} \mathbf{u}_\mathrm{t}+ \frac{v^2}{r}\mathbf{u}_\mathrm{n}\ , \\
\end{alignat}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''u'''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is the  unit (inward) [[Differential geometry of curves#Normal or curvature vector|normal vector]] to the particle's trajectory (also called ''the principal normal''), and '''r''' is its instantaneous [[Curvature#Curvature of plane curves|radius of curvature]] based upon the [[Osculating circle#Mathematical description|osculating circle]] at time ''t''. These components are called the [[tangential acceleration]] and the normal or radial acceleration (or centripetal acceleration in circular motion, see also [[circular motion]] and [[centripetal force]]).

Geometrical analysis of three-dimensional space curves, which explains tangent, (principal) normal and binormal, is described by the [[Frenet–Serret formulas]].&lt;ref name = Andrews&gt;{{cite book |title = Mathematical Techniques for Engineers and Scientists |author = Larry C.

== Special cases ==

===Uniform acceleration===
''Uniform'' or ''constant'' acceleration is a type of motion in which the [[velocity]] of an object changes by an equal amount in every equal time period.

A frequently cited example of uniform acceleration is that of an object in [[free fall]] in a uniform gravitational field. The acceleration of a falling body in the absence of resistances to motion is dependent only on the [[gravitational field]] strength ''[[standard gravity|g]]'' (also called ''acceleration due to gravity''). By [[Newton's Second Law]] the [[force]], ''F'', acting on a body is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = m  \mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt;

Due to the simple algebraic properties of constant acceleration in the one-dimensional case (that is, the case of acceleration aligned with the initial velocity), there are simple formulas relating the quantities [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] ''s'', initial [[velocity]] ''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, final velocity ''v'', acceleration ''a'', and [[time]] ''t'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Physics for you: revised national curriculum edition for GCSE |author=Keith Johnson |publisher=Nelson Thornes |year=2001 |edition=4th |page=135 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=D4nrQDzq1jkC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;dq=suvat#v=onepage&amp;q=suvat&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-7487-6236-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; v = v_0 + a t &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; s = v_0 t+ \frac{1}{2} at^2 = \frac{v_0+v}{2}t &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; |v|^2= |v_0|^2 + 2 \, a \cdot s &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; = displacement

:&lt;math&gt;v_0&lt;/math&gt; = initial velocity

:&lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; = final velocity

:&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; = uniform acceleration

:&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; = time.

In the case of uniform acceleration of an object that is initially moving in a direction not aligned with the acceleration, the motion can be resolved into two orthogonal parts, one of constant velocity and the other according to the above equations.  As [[Galileo]] showed, the net result is parabolic motion, as in the trajectory of a cannonball, neglecting air resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding physics |author=David C. Cassidy, Gerald James Holton, and F. James Rutherford |publisher=Birkhäuser |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-387-98756-9 |page=146 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iPsKvL_ATygC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;dq=parabolic+arc+uniform-acceleration+galileo#v=onepage&amp;q=parabolic%20arc%20uniform-acceleration%20galileo&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Circular motion===
Uniform [[circular motion]], that is constant speed along a circular path, is an example of a body experiencing acceleration resulting in velocity of a constant magnitude but change of direction. In this case, because the direction of the object's motion is constantly changing, being tangential to the circle, the object's linear [[velocity]] vector also changes, but its speed does not. This acceleration is a radial acceleration since it is always directed toward the centre of the circle and takes the magnitude:

:&lt;math&gt; \textrm{a} = {{v^2} \over {r}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the object's linear [[speed]] along the circular path. Equivalently, the radial acceleration vector (&lt;math&gt; \mathbf {a}&lt;/math&gt;) may be calculated from the object's [[angular velocity]] &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf {a}= {-\omega^2}  \mathbf {r} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r} &lt;/math&gt; is a vector directed from the centre of the circle and equal in magnitude to the radius. The negative shows that the acceleration vector is directed towards the centre of the circle (opposite to the radius).

The acceleration and the net force acting on a body in uniform circular motion are directed ''toward'' the centre of the circle; that is, it is [[centripetal force|centripetal]]. Whereas the so-called '[[centrifugal force]]' appearing to act outward on the body is really a [[pseudo force]] experienced in the [[frame of reference]] of the body in circular motion, due to the body's [[linear momentum]] at a tangent to the circle.

With nonuniform circular motion, i.e., the speed along the curved path changes, a transverse acceleration is produced equal to the rate of change of the angular speed around the circle times the radius of the circle. That is,

:&lt;math&gt; a = r \alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

The transverse (or tangential) acceleration is directed at right angles to the radius vector and takes the sign of the [[angular acceleration]] (&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;).

== Relation to relativity ==

===Special relativity===
{{main|Special relativity}}
The special theory of relativity describes the behavior of objects traveling relative to other objects at speeds approaching that of light in a vacuum. [[Newtonian mechanics]] is exactly revealed to be an approximation to reality, valid to great accuracy at lower speeds. As the relevant speeds increase toward the speed of light, acceleration no longer follows classical equations.

As speeds approach that of light, the acceleration produced by a given force decreases, becoming infinitesimally small as light speed is approached; an object with mass can approach this speed [[asymptotically]], but never reach it.

===General relativity===
{{main|General relativity}}
Unless the state of motion of an object is known, it is totally impossible to distinguish whether an observed force is due to [[gravity]] or to acceleration—gravity and inertial acceleration have identical effects. [[Albert Einstein]] called this the [[principle of equivalence]], and said that only observers who feel no force at all—including the force of gravity—are justified in concluding that they are not accelerating.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Greene, The Fabric of the Cosmos, page 67.
