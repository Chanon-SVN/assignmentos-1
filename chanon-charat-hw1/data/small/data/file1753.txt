==Biography==
Abu al-Faraj al-Iṣbahānī was born in [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]], but spent his youth and made his early studies in [[Baghdad]]. He was a direct descendant of the last of the [[Umayyad]] [[caliph]]s, [[Marwan II]], and was thus connected with the Umayyad rulers in [[Spain]], and seems to have kept up a correspondence with them and to have sent them some of his works. He became famous for his knowledge of early Arabian antiquities. &lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot;&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Abulfaraj|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His later life was spent in various parts of the Islamic world, in [[Aleppo]] with its governor [[Hamdanid Dynasty|Sayf ad-Dawlah]] (to whom he dedicated the ''Book of Songs''), in [[Ray, Iran|Ray]] with the [[Buwayhid]] [[vizier]] [[Ibn 'Abbad]], and elsewhere.  &lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot; /&gt;

Although he wrote [[poetry]], also an anthology of verses on the [[monastery|monasteries]] of [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Egypt]], and a genealogical work, his fame rests upon his ''Book of Songs'' ([[Kitab al-Aghani]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot; /&gt;

==''Book of Songs''==
''[[Kitab al-Aghani]]'' (''Book of Songs''), a collection of poems and songs with the stories of the composers and singers in many volumes from the oldest epoch of Arabic literature down to the 9th century.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]]'', ISBN 0-550-18022-2, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The poems were put to music, but the musical signs are no longer readable. Because of the accompanying biographical annotations on the authors and composers, the work is an important historical source. 
It contains a mass of information as to the life and customs of the early Arabs, and is the most valuable authority we have for their pre-Islamic and early Islamic days.&lt;ref name=&quot;eb&quot; /&gt;
