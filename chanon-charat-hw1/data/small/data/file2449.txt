{{Evolutionary biology}}

'''Bioinformatics''' {{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-bioinformatics.ogg|ˌ|b|aɪ|.|oʊ|ˌ|ɪ|n|f|ɚ|ˈ|m|æ|t|ɪ|k|s}} is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data. As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines [[computer science]], [[statistics]], [[mathematics]], and [[engineering]] to study and process biological data.

Bioinformatics is both an umbrella term for the body of biological studies that use computer programming as part of their methodology, as well as a reference to specific analysis &quot;pipelines&quot; that are repeatedly used, particularly in the fields of [[genetics]] and [[genomics]]. Common uses of bioinformatics include the identification of candidate genes and nucleotides (SNPs). Often, such identification is made with the aim of better understanding the genetic basis of disease, unique adaptations, desirable properties (esp. in agricultural species), or differences between populations. In a less formal way, bioinformatics also tries to understand the organisational principles within [[nucleic acid]] and [[protein]] sequences.

==Introduction==
Bioinformatics has become an important part of many areas of biology. In experimental molecular biology, bioinformatics techniques such as image and [[signal processing]] allow extraction of useful results from large amounts of raw data. In the field of genetics and genomics, it aids in sequencing and annotating genomes and their observed [[mutation]]s. It plays a role in the [[text mining]] of biological literature and the development of biological and gene ontologies to organize and query biological data. It also plays a role in the analysis of gene and protein expression and regulation. Bioinformatics tools aid in the comparison of genetic and genomic data and more generally in the understanding of evolutionary aspects of molecular biology. At a more integrative level, it helps analyze and catalogue the biological pathways and networks that are an important part of systems biology. In structural biology, it aids in the simulation and modeling of DNA, RNA, and protein structures as well as molecular interactions.

===History===
[[Paulien Hogeweg]] and [[Ben Hesper]] coined the term ''bioinformatics'' in 1970 to refer to the study of information processes in biotic systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hogeweg2011&quot;&gt;{{cite pmid|21483479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hesper B, Hogeweg P |year=1970 |title=Bioinformatica: een werkconcept |publisher=Kameleon |volume=1 |issue=6 |pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1177/003754977803100305}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition placed bioinformatics as a field parallel to [[biophysics]] (the study of physical processes in biological systems) or [[biochemistry]] (the study of chemical processes in biological systems).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hogeweg2011&quot; /&gt;

====Sequences====
Computers became essential in molecular biology when [[protein sequences]] became available after [[Frederick Sanger]] determined the sequence of [[insulin]] in the early 1950s. Comparing multiple sequences manually turned out to be impractical. A pioneer in the field was [[Margaret Oakley Dayhoff]], who has been hailed by [[David Lipman]], director of the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]], as the &quot;mother and father of bioinformatics.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Glyn |last=Moody |year=2004 |title=Digital Code of Life: How Bioinformatics is Revolutionizing Science, Medicine, and Business | isbn= 978-0-471-32788-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dayhoff compiled one of the first protein sequence databases, initially published as books&lt;ref&gt;Dayhoff, M.O. (1966) Atlas of protein sequence and structure. National Biomedical Research Foundation, 215 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; and pioneered methods of sequence alignment and molecular evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Eck RV, Dayhoff MO. (1966) Evolution of the Structure of Ferredoxin Based on Living Relics of Primitive Amino Acid Sequences. Science. 1966 Apr 15;152(3720):363‐366&lt;/ref&gt; Another early contributor to bioinformatics was [[Elvin A. Kabat]], who pioneered biological sequence analysis in 1970 with his comprehensive volumes of antibody sequences released with Tai Te Wu between 1980 and 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=George|author2=Tai Te Wua|title=Kabat Database and its applications: 30 years after the first variability plot|journal=Nucleic Acids Res |date=January 2000|volume=28|issue=1|pages=214–218|pmc=102431|doi=10.1093/nar/28.1.214|pmid=10592229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Genomes====
As whole genome sequences became available, again with the pioneering work of Frederick Sanger,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/265687a0 |title=Nucleotide sequence of bacteriophage φX174 DNA |year=1977 |last1=Sanger |first1=F. |last2=Air |first2=G. M. |last3=Barrell |first3=B. G. |last4=Brown|first4=N. L. |last5=Coulson |first5=A. R. |last6=Fiddes |first6=J. C. |last7=Hutchison |first7=C. A. |last8=Slocombe |first8=P. M. |last9=Smith |first9=M. |journal=Nature |volume=265 |issue=5596 |pages=687–95 |pmid=870828|bibcode = 1977Natur.265..687S }}&lt;/ref&gt; it became evident that computer-assisted analysis would be insightful.  The first analysis of this type, which had important input from cryptologists at the [[National Security Agency]], was applied to the nucleotide sequences of the bacteriophages [[bacteriophage MS2|MS2]] and [[Phi X 174|PhiX174]].  As a proof of principle, this work showed that standard methods of cryptology could reveal intrinsic features of the genetic code such as the codon length and the reading frame.  This work seems to have been ahead of its time—it was rejected for publication by numerous standard journals and finally found a home in the Journal of Theoretical Biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The coding function of nucleotide sequences can be discerned by statistical analysis. |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology.|volume=88|pages=409–420|year=1981|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(81)90274-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term bioinformatics was re-discovered and used to refer to the creation of databases such as [[GenBank]] in 1982. With public availability of data, tools for their analysis were quickly developed and described in journals, such as ''[[Nucleic Acids Research]]'', which published specialized issues on bioinformatics tools as early as 1982.

===Goals===
To study how normal cellular activities are altered in different disease states, the biological data must be combined to form a comprehensive picture of these activities. Therefore, the field of bioinformatics has evolved such that the most pressing task now involves the analysis and interpretation of various types of data. This includes nucleotide and amino acid sequences, [[protein domain]]s, and [[protein structure]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concepts, Historical Milestones and the Central Place of Bioinformatics in Modern Biology: A European Perspective|url=http://www.intechopen.com/articles/show/title/concepts-historical-milestones-and-the-central-place-of-bioinformatics-in-modern-biology-a-european-|work=Bioinformatics – Trends and Methodologies|publisher= InTech |accessdate=8 Jan 2012|author = Attwood TK, Gisel A, Eriksson N-E, Bongcam-Rudloff E |year = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual process of analyzing and interpreting data is referred to as [[computational biology]]. Important sub-disciplines within bioinformatics and computational biology include:

* Development and implementation of computer programs that enable efficient access to, use and management of, various types of information
* Development of new algorithms (mathematical formulas) and statistical measures that assess relationships among members of large data sets. For example, there are methods to locate a [[gene]] within a sequence, to predict protein structure and/or function, and to [[Cluster analysis|cluster]] protein sequences into families of related sequences.

The primary goal of bioinformatics is to increase the understanding of biological processes. What sets it apart from other approaches, however, is its focus on developing and applying computationally intensive techniques to achieve this goal. Examples include: [[pattern recognition]], [[data mining]], [[machine learning]] algorithms, and [[Biological Data Visualization|visualization]]. Major research efforts in the field include [[sequence alignment]], [[gene finding]], [[genome assembly]], [[drug design]], [[drug discovery]], [[protein structural alignment|protein structure alignment]], [[protein structure prediction]], prediction of [[gene expression]] and [[protein–protein interactions]], [[genome-wide association studies]], and the modeling of [[evolution]].

Bioinformatics now entails the creation and advancement of databases, algorithms, computational and statistical techniques, and theory to solve formal and practical problems arising from the management and analysis of biological data.

Over the past few decades rapid developments in genomic and other molecular research technologies and developments in information technologies have combined to produce a tremendous amount of information related to molecular biology. Bioinformatics is the name given to these mathematical and computing approaches used to glean understanding of biological processes.

===Approaches===
Common activities in bioinformatics include mapping and analyzing [[DNA]] and protein sequences, aligning DNA and protein sequences to compare them, and creating and viewing 3-D models of protein structures.

There are two fundamental ways of modelling a Biological system (e.g., living cell) both coming under Bioinformatic approaches.
* Static
** Sequences – Proteins, Nucleic acids and Peptides
** Interaction data among the above entities including [[microarray]] data and Networks of proteins, metabolites
* Dynamic
** Structures – Proteins, Nucleic acids, Ligands (including metabolites and drugs) and Peptides (structures studied with bioinformatics tools are not considered static anymore and their dynamics is often the core of the structural studies)
** Systems Biology comes under this category including reaction fluxes and variable concentrations of metabolites
** Multi-Agent Based modelling approaches capturing cellular events such as signalling, transcription and reaction dynamics

A broad sub-category under bioinformatics is [[structural bioinformatics]].

===Relation to other fields===
Bioinformatics is a science field that is similar to but distinct from [[biological computation]] and [[computational biology]]. Biological computation uses [[bioengineering]] and [[biology]] to build biological [[computer]]s, whereas bioinformatics uses computation to better understand biology. Bioinformatics and computational biology have similar aims and approaches, but they differ in scale: bioinformatics organizes and analyzes basic biological data, whereas computational biology builds theoretical models of biological systems, just as [[mathematical biology]] does with mathematical models.

Analyzing biological data to produce meaningful information involves writing and running software programs that use [[algorithm]]s from [[graph theory]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[soft computing]], [[data mining]], [[image processing]], and [[computer simulation]]. The algorithms in turn depend on theoretical foundations such as [[discrete mathematics]], [[control theory]], [[system theory]], [[information theory]], and [[statistics]].

== Sequence analysis ==
[[File:WPP domain alignment.PNG|500px|thumbnail|left|The sequences of different genes or proteins may be aligned side-by-side to measure their similarity. This alignment compares protein sequences containing [[WPP domain]]s.]]

{{main|Sequence alignment|Sequence database}}

Since the [[Phi X 174|Phage Φ-X174]] was [[sequencing|sequenced]] in 1977,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid870828&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Nucleotide sequence of bacteriophage phi X174 DNA |journal=Nature |volume=265 |issue=5596 |pages=687–95 |date=February 1977 |pmid=870828 |doi= 10.1038/265687a0|url=|bibcode = 1977Natur.265..687S |last2=Air |first2=G.M. |last3=Barrell |first3=B.G. |last4=Brown |first4=N.L. |last5=Coulson |first5=A.R. |last6=Fiddes |first6=J.C. |last7=Hutchison |first7=C.A. |last8=Slocombe |last9=Smith |last1 = Sanger|first1 = F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[DNA sequence]]s of thousands of organisms have been decoded and stored in databases. This sequence information is analyzed to determine genes that encode [[protein]]s, RNA genes, regulatory sequences, structural motifs, and repetitive sequences. A comparison of genes within a [[species]] or between different species can show similarities between protein functions, or relations between species (the use of [[molecular systematics]] to construct [[phylogenetic tree]]s). With the growing amount of data, it long ago became impractical to analyze DNA sequences manually. Today, [[computer program]]s such as [[BLAST]] are used daily to search sequences from more than 260 000 organisms, containing over 190 billion [[nucleotides]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18073190&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Benson DA, Karsch-Mizrachi I, Lipman DJ, Ostell J, Wheeler DL |title=GenBank |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=36 |issue=Database issue |pages=D25–30 |date=January 2008 |pmid=18073190 |pmc=2238942 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkm929 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programs can compensate for mutations (exchanged, deleted or inserted bases) in the DNA sequence, to identify sequences that are related, but not identical. A variant of this [[sequence alignment]] is used in the sequencing process itself. The so-called [[shotgun sequencing]] technique (which was used, for example, by [[The Institute for Genomic Research]] to sequence the first bacterial genome, ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'')&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid7542800&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fleischmann RD, Adams MD, White O, Clayton RA, Kirkness EF, Kerlavage AR, Bult CJ, Tomb JF, Dougherty BA, Merrick JM |title=Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of Haemophilus influenzae Rd |journal=Science |volume=269 |issue=5223 |pages=496–512 |date=July 1995 |pmid=7542800 |doi= 10.1126/science.7542800|url=|bibcode = 1995Sci...269..496F |last2=Adams |last3=White |last4=Clayton |last5=Kirkness |last6=Kerlavage |last7=Bult |last8=Tomb |last9=Dougherty |last10=Merrick |last11=McKenney |last12=Sutton |last13=Fitzhugh |last14=Fields |last15=Gocyne |last16=Scott |last17=Shirley |last18=Liu |last19=Glodek |last20=Kelley |last21=Weidman |last22=Phillips |last23=Spriggs |last24=Hedblom |last25=Cotton |last26=Utterback |last27=Hanna |last28=Nguyen |last29=Saudek |last30=Brandon |display-authors=29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; does not produce entire chromosomes. Instead it generates the sequences of many thousands of small DNA fragments (ranging from 35 to 900 nucleotides long, depending on the sequencing technology). The ends of these fragments overlap and, when aligned properly by a genome assembly program, can be used to reconstruct the complete genome. Shotgun sequencing yields sequence data quickly, but the task of assembling the fragments can be quite complicated for larger genomes. For a genome as large as the [[human genome]], it may take many days of CPU time on large-memory, multiprocessor computers to assemble the fragments, and the resulting assembly usually contains numerous gaps that must be filled in later. Shotgun sequencing is the method of choice for virtually all genomes sequenced today, and genome assembly algorithms are a critical area of bioinformatics research.

Another aspect of bioinformatics in sequence analysis is annotation. This involves computational [[gene finding]] to search for protein-coding genes, RNA genes, and other functional sequences within a genome. Not all of the nucleotides within a genome are part of genes. Within the genomes of higher organisms, large parts of the DNA do not serve any obvious purpose. This so-called [[junk DNA]] may, however, contain unrecognized functional elements. Bioinformatics helps to bridge the gap between genome and [[proteome]] projects — for example, in the use of DNA sequences for protein identification.

===Genome annotation===
{{main|Gene prediction}}

In the context of [[genomics]], [[Genome project#Genome annotation|annotation]] is the process of marking the genes and other biological features in a DNA sequence. This process needs to be automated because most genomes are too large to annotate by hand, not to mention the desire to annotate as many genomes as possible, as the rate of [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] has ceased to pose a bottleneck. Annotation is made possible by the fact that genes have recognisable start and stop regions, although the exact sequence found in these regions can vary between genes.

The first genome annotation software system was designed in 1995 by [[Owen White]], who was part of the team at [[The Institute for Genomic Research]] that sequenced and analyzed the first genome of a free-living organism to be decoded, the bacterium ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''. White built a software system to find the genes (fragments of genomic sequence that encode proteins), the transfer RNAs, and to make initial assignments of function to those genes. Most current genome annotation systems work similarly, but the programs available for analysis of genomic DNA, such as the [[GeneMark]] program trained and used to find protein-coding genes in ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'', are constantly changing and improving.

===Computational evolutionary biology===
[[Evolutionary biology]] is the study of the origin and descent of [[species]], as well as their change over time. [[Informatics (academic field)|Informatics]] has assisted evolutionary biologists by enabling researchers to:
* trace the evolution of a large number of organisms by measuring changes in their [[DNA]], rather than through physical taxonomy or physiological observations alone,
* more recently, compare entire [[genomes]], which permits the study of more complex evolutionary events, such as [[gene duplication]], [[horizontal gene transfer]], and the prediction of factors important in bacterial [[speciation]],
* build complex computational models of populations to predict the outcome of the system over time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Simulation of Genes and Genomes Forward in Time|journal=Current Genomics|publisher= Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.|author = Antonio Carvajal-Rodríguez|year = 2012|pmc=2851118|volume=11|issue=1|pages=58–61|doi=10.2174/138920210790218007|pmid=20808525}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* track and share information on an increasingly large number of species and organisms
Future work endeavours to reconstruct the now more complex [[Evolutionary tree|tree of life]].

The area of research within [[computer science]] that uses [[genetic algorithm]]s is sometimes confused with computational evolutionary biology, but the two areas are not necessarily related.

=== Comparative genomics ===
{{main|Comparative genomics}}

The core of comparative genome analysis is the establishment of the correspondence between [[genes]] ([[Homology (biology)#Orthology|orthology]] analysis) or other genomic features in different organisms. It is these intergenomic maps that make it possible to trace the evolutionary processes responsible for the divergence of two genomes. A multitude of evolutionary events acting at various organizational levels shape genome evolution. At the lowest level, point mutations affect individual nucleotides. At a higher level, large chromosomal segments undergo duplication, lateral transfer, inversion, transposition, deletion and insertion. Ultimately, whole genomes are involved in processes of hybridization, polyploidization and [[endosymbiosis]], often leading to rapid speciation. The complexity of genome evolution poses many exciting challenges to developers of mathematical models and algorithms, who have recourse to a spectra of algorithmic, statistical and mathematical techniques, ranging from exact, [[heuristics]], fixed parameter and [[approximation algorithms]] for problems based on parsimony models to [[Markov Chain Monte Carlo]] algorithms for [[Bayesian analysis]] of problems based on probabilistic models.

Many of these studies are based on the [[Homology (biology)|homology]] detection and protein families computation.

===Genetics of disease===
{{main| Genome-wide association studies}}
With the advent of next-generation sequencing we are obtaining enough sequence data to map the genes of complex diseases such as [[infertility]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Demerec1945&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid| 24574159}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[breast cancer]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Véron2013&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid| 24521025}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Alzheimer's Disease]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tosto2013&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid| 23954969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genome-wide association studies are essential to pinpoint the mutations for such complex diseases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Londin2013&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid| 23824853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Analysis of mutations in cancer ===
{{main|Oncogenomics}}
In cancer, the genomes of affected cells are rearranged in complex or even unpredictable ways. Massive sequencing efforts are used to identify previously unknown [[point mutation]]s in a variety of [[gene]]s in [[cancer]]. Bioinformaticians continue to produce specialized automated systems to manage the sheer volume of sequence data produced, and they create new algorithms and software to compare the sequencing results to the growing collection of [[human genome]] sequences and [[germline]] polymorphisms. New physical detection technologies are employed, such as [[oligonucleotide]] microarrays to identify chromosomal gains and losses (called [[comparative genomic hybridization]]), and [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] arrays to detect known ''point mutations''. These detection methods simultaneously measure several hundred thousand sites throughout the genome, and when used in high-throughput to measure thousands of samples, generate [[terabyte]]s of data per experiment. Again the massive amounts and new types of data generate new opportunities for bioinformaticians. The data is often found to contain considerable variability, or [[noise]], and thus [[Hidden Markov model]] and change-point analysis methods are being developed to infer real [[copy number variation|copy number]] changes.

Another type of data that requires novel informatics development is the analysis of [[lesion]]s found to be recurrent among many tumors.

== Gene and protein expression ==

===Analysis of gene expression===
The [[gene expression|expression]] of many genes can be determined by measuring [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]] levels with multiple techniques including [[DNA microarray|microarrays]], [[expressed sequence tag|expressed cDNA sequence tag]] (EST) sequencing, [[serial analysis of gene expression]] (SAGE) tag sequencing, [[massively parallel signature sequencing]] (MPSS), [[RNA-Seq]], also known as &quot;Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing&quot; (WTSS), or various applications of multiplexed in-situ hybridization. All of these techniques are extremely noise-prone and/or subject to bias in the biological measurement, and a major research area in computational biology involves developing statistical tools to separate [[signal (information theory)|signal]] from [[noise]] in high-throughput gene expression studies. Such studies are often used to determine the genes implicated in a disorder: one might compare microarray data from cancerous [[epithelial]] cells to data from non-cancerous cells to determine the transcripts that are up-regulated and down-regulated in a particular population of cancer cells.

=== Analysis of protein expression ===
[[Protein microarray]]s and high throughput (HT) [[mass spectrometry]] (MS) can provide a snapshot of the proteins present in a biological sample. Bioinformatics is very much involved in making sense of protein microarray and HT MS data; the former approach faces similar problems as with microarrays targeted at mRNA, the latter involves the problem of matching large amounts of mass data against predicted masses from protein sequence databases, and the complicated statistical analysis of samples where multiple, but incomplete peptides from each protein are detected.

===Analysis of regulation===
Regulation is the complex orchestration of events starting with an extracellular signal such as a [[hormone]] and leading to an increase or decrease in the activity of one or more [[protein]]s. Bioinformatics techniques have been applied to explore various steps in this process. For example, promoter analysis involves the identification and study of [[sequence motif]]s in the DNA surrounding the coding region of a gene. These motifs influence the extent to which that region is transcribed into mRNA. Expression data can be used to infer gene regulation: one might compare [[microarray]] data from a wide variety of states of an organism to form hypotheses about the genes involved in each state. In a single-cell organism, one might compare stages of the [[cell cycle]], along with various stress conditions (heat shock, starvation, etc.). One can then apply [[cluster analysis|clustering algorithms]] to that expression data to determine which genes are co-expressed. For example, the upstream regions (promoters) of co-expressed genes can be searched for over-represented [[regulatory elements]]. Examples of clustering algorithms applied in gene clustering are [[k-means clustering]], [[self-organizing map]]s (SOMs), [[hierarchical clustering]], and [[consensus clustering]] methods such as the [[Bi-CoPaM]]. The later, namely [[Bi-CoPaM]], has been actually proposed to address various issues specific to gene discovery problems such as consistent co-expression of genes over multiple microarray datasets.&lt;ref name=AbuJamousPLOSONE&gt;{{cite journal |author=Abu-Jamous B, Fa R, Roberts DJ, Nandi AK, Peddada SD|title=Paradigm of Tunable Clustering Using Binarization of Consensus Partition Matrices (Bi-CoPaM) for Gene Discovery |journal=PLoS ONE |date=11 February 2013 |volume=8|issue=2|pages=e56432|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0056432|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0056432|editor1-last=Peddada|editor1-first=Shyamal D|pmid=23409186|pmc=3569426|bibcode = 2013PLoSO...856432A |last2=Fa |last3=Roberts |last4=Nandi }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AbuJamousInterface&gt;{{cite journal|author=Abu-Jamous B, Fa R, Roberts DJ, Nandi AK |title=Yeast gene CMR1/YDL156W is consistently co-expressed with genes participating in DNA-metabolic processes in a variety of stringent clustering experiments|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|date=24 January 2013 |volume=10|issue=81|pages=20120990–20120990|doi=10.1098/rsif.2012.0990|url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/10/81/20120990.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structural bioinformatics== &lt;!-- this is specific enough, compared to general knowledge in previous paragraph, that it would be nice to have a source or example --&gt;
{{main|Structural bioinformatics|Protein structure prediction}}
{{See also|Structural motif|Structural domain}}

Protein structure prediction is another important application of bioinformatics. The [[amino acid]] sequence of a protein, the so-called [[primary structure]], can be easily determined from the sequence on the gene that codes for it. In the vast majority of cases, this primary structure uniquely determines a structure in its native environment. (Of course, there are exceptions, such as the [[bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] – a.k.a. [[Mad Cow Disease]] – [[prion]].) Knowledge of this structure is vital in understanding the function of the protein. Structural information is usually classified as one of ''[[secondary structure|secondary]]'', ''[[tertiary structure|tertiary]]'' and ''[[quaternary structure|quaternary]]'' structure. A viable general solution to such predictions remains an open problem. Most efforts have so far been directed towards heuristics that work most of the time.

One of the key ideas in bioinformatics is the notion of [[homology (biology)|homology]]. In the genomic branch of bioinformatics, homology is used to predict the function of a gene: if the sequence of gene ''A'', whose function is known, is homologous to the sequence of gene ''B,'' whose function is unknown, one could infer that B may share A's function. In the structural branch of bioinformatics, homology is used to determine which parts of a protein are important in structure formation and interaction with other proteins. In a technique called homology modeling, this information is used to predict the structure of a protein once the structure of a homologous protein is known. This currently remains the only way to predict protein structures reliably.

One example of this is the similar protein homology between hemoglobin in humans and the hemoglobin in legumes ([[leghemoglobin]]). Both serve the same purpose of transporting oxygen in the organism. Though both of these proteins have completely different amino acid sequences, their protein structures are virtually identical, which reflects their near identical purposes.

Other techniques for predicting protein structure include protein threading and ''de novo'' (from scratch) physics-based modeling.

== Network and systems biology ==
{{main|Computational systems biology|Biological network|Interactome}}

''Network analysis'' seeks to understand the relationships within [[biological network]]s such as [[Metabolic network|metabolic]] or [[Interactome|protein-protein interaction networks]]. Although biological networks can be constructed from a single type of molecule or entity (such as genes), network biology often attempts to integrate many different data types, such as proteins, small molecules, gene expression data, and others, which are all connected physically, functionally, or both.

''Systems biology'' involves the use of [[computer simulation]]s of [[cell (biology)|cellular]] subsystems (such as the [[metabolic network|networks of metabolites]] and [[enzyme]]s that comprise [[metabolism]], [[signal transduction]] pathways and [[gene regulatory network]]s) to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of these cellular processes. [[Artificial life]] or virtual evolution attempts to understand evolutionary processes via the computer simulation of simple (artificial) life forms.

===Molecular interaction networks===
[[File:The protein interaction network of Treponema pallidum.png|200px|thumbnail|right|Interactions between proteins are frequently visualized and analyzed using networks. This network is made up of protein-protein interactions from ''[[Treponema pallidum]]'', the causative agent of [[syphilis]] and other diseases.]]
{{main|Protein–protein interaction prediction|interactome}}

Tens of thousands of three-dimensional protein structures have been determined by [[X-ray crystallography]] and [[protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] (protein NMR) and a central question in structural bioinformatics is whether it is practical to predict possible protein–protein interactions only based on these 3D shapes, without performing [[protein–protein interaction]] experiments. A variety of methods have been developed to tackle the [[protein–protein docking]] problem, though it seems that there is still much work to be done in this field.

Other interactions encountered in the field include Protein–ligand (including drug) and [[protein–peptide]]. Molecular dynamic simulation of movement of atoms about rotatable bonds is the fundamental principle behind computational [[algorithm]]s, termed docking algorithms, for studying [[interactome|molecular interactions]].

== Others ==

=== Literature analysis ===
{{main|Text mining|Biomedical text mining}}

The growth in the number of published literature makes it virtually impossible to read every paper, resulting in disjointed sub-fields of research. Literature analysis aims to employ computational and statistical linguistics to mine this growing library of text resources. For example:
* Abbreviation recognition – identify the long-form and abbreviation of biological terms
* Named entity recognition – recognizing biological terms such as gene names
* Protein-protein interaction – identify which [[proteins]] interact with which proteins from text

The area of research draws from [[statistics]] and [[computational linguistics]].

=== High-throughput image analysis ===
Computational technologies are used to accelerate or fully automate the processing, quantification and analysis of large amounts of high-information-content [[medical imaging|biomedical imagery]]. Modern image analysis systems augment an observer's ability to make measurements from a large or complex set of images, by improving [[accuracy]], [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]], or speed. A fully developed analysis system may completely replace the observer. Although these systems are not unique to biomedical imagery, biomedical imaging is becoming more important for both [[diagnostics]] and research. Some examples are:
* high-throughput and high-fidelity quantification and sub-cellular localization ([[high-content screening]], cytohistopathology, [[Bioimage informatics]])
* [[morphometrics]]
* clinical image analysis and visualization

=== High-throughput single cell data analysis ===
{{main|Flow cytometry bioinformatics}}
Computational techniques are used to analyse high-throughput, low-measurement single cell data, such as that obtained from [[flow cytometry]]. These methods typically involve finding populations of cells that are relevant to a particular disease state or experimental condition.

=== Biodiversity informatics ===
{{main|Biodiversity informatics}}
Biodiversity informatics deals with the collection and analysis of [[biodiversity]] data, such as [[taxonomic database]]s, or [[microbiome]] data. Examples of such analyses include [[phylogenetics]], [[niche modelling]], [[species richness]] mapping, or [[Speciesism|species]] identification tools.

== Databases ==
{{main|List of biological databases|Biological database}}
Databases are essential for bioinformatics research and applications. There is a huge number of available databases covering almost everything from DNA and protein sequences, molecular structures, to phenotypes and biodiversity. Databases generally fall into one of three types. Some contain data resulting directly from empirical methods such as gene knockouts. Others consist of predicted data, and most contain data from both sources. There are meta-databases that incorporate data compiled from multiple other databases. Some others are specialized, such as those specific to an organism. These databases vary in their format, way of accession and whether they are public or not. Some of the most commonly used databases are listed below. For a more comprehensive list, please check the link at the beginning of the subsection.
* Used in [[Sequence motif|Motif]] Finding: [http://www.genome.jp/tools/motif/ GenomeNet MOTIF Search]
* Used in Gene Ontology: [http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/ DAVID], [http://llama.mshri.on.ca/cgi/func/funcassociate FuncAssociate], [http://gather.genome.duke.edu GATHER]
* Used in Gene Finding: [[Hidden Markov Model]]
* Used in finding Protein Structures/Family: [http://pfam.xfam.org/ PFAM]
* Used for Next Generation Sequencing: (Not database but data format), [[FASTQ Format]]
* Used in Gene Expression Analysis: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/ GEO]
* Used in Network Analysis: Interaction Analysis Databases([http://www.thebiogrid.org/ BioGRID], [http://mint.bio.uniroma2.it/mint/ MINT], [http://www.hprd.org/ HPRD], [http://www.cancer-systemsbiology.org/datasoftware.htm/ Curated Human Signaling Network]), Functional Networks ([http://string.embl.de/%20 STRING], [http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/pathway.html KEGG])

Please keep in mind that this is a quick sampling and generally most computation data is supported by wet lab data as well.

==Software and tools==
[[Software]] tools for bioinformatics range from simple command-line tools, to more complex graphical programs and standalone web-services available from various [[List of bioinformatics companies|bioinformatics companies]] or public institutions.

===Open-source bioinformatics software===
Many [[free and open-source software]] tools have existed and continued to grow since the 1980s.&lt;ref name=obf-main&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Bioinformatics Foundation: About us|url=http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Main_Page|work=Official website|publisher=[[Open Bioinformatics Foundation]]|accessdate=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of a continued need for new [[algorithm]]s for the analysis of emerging types of biological readouts, the potential for innovative ''[[in silico]]'' experiments, and freely available [[open code]] bases have helped to create opportunities for all research groups to contribute to both bioinformatics and the range of open-source software available, regardless of their funding arrangements. The open source tools often act as incubators of ideas, or community-supported [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] in commercial applications. They may also provide ''[[de facto]]'' standards and shared object models for assisting with the challenge of bioinformation integration.

The [[List of open-source bioinformatics software|range of open-source software packages]] includes titles such as [[Bioconductor]], [[BioPerl]], [[Biopython]], [[BioJava]], [[BioJS]], [[BioRuby]], [[Bioclipse]], [[EMBOSS]], [[.NET Bio]], [[Taverna workbench]], and [[UGENE]]. To maintain this tradition and create further opportunities, the non-profit [[Open Bioinformatics Foundation]]&lt;ref name=obf-main /&gt; have supported the annual [[Bioinformatics Open Source Conference]] (BOSC) since 2000.&lt;ref name=obf-bosc&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Bioinformatics Foundation: BOSC|url=http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC|work=Official website|publisher=[[Open Bioinformatics Foundation]]|accessdate=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Web services in bioinformatics===
[[SOAP]]- and [[REST]]-based interfaces have been developed for a wide variety of bioinformatics applications allowing an application running on one computer in one part of the world to use algorithms, data and computing resources on servers in other parts of the world. The main advantages derive from the fact that end users do not have to deal with software and database maintenance overheads.

Basic bioinformatics services are classified by the [[European Bioinformatics Institute|EBI]] into three categories: [[Sequence alignment software|SSS]] (Sequence Search Services), [[Multiple sequence alignment|MSA]] (Multiple Sequence Alignment), and [[Bioinformatics#Sequence analysis|BSA]] (Biological Sequence Analysis).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Nisbet | first = Robert | others = John Elder IV, Gary Miner | title = Handbook of Statistical Analysis and Data Mining Applications | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=U5np34a5fmQC&amp;pg=PA328&amp;dq=bioinformatics+service+categories+EBI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Jk9tU9KoKu_ksAS-x4DIDA&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bioinformatics%20service%20categories%20EBI&amp;f=false | accessdate = 9 May 2014 | publisher = Academic Press | date = 14 May 2009 | pages = 328 | chapter = BIOINFORMATICS }}&lt;/ref&gt; The availability of these [[Service-orientation|service-oriented]] bioinformatics resources demonstrate the applicability of web-based bioinformatics solutions, and range from a collection of standalone tools with a common data format under a single, standalone or web-based interface, to integrative, distributed and extensible [[bioinformatics workflow management systems]].

===Bioinformatics workflow management systems===
{{main|Bioinformatics workflow management systems}}

A [[Bioinformatics workflow management systems|Bioinformatics workflow management system]] is a specialized form of a [[workflow management system]] designed specifically to compose and execute a series of computational or data manipulation steps, or a workflow, in a Bioinformatics application.  Such systems are designed to
* provide an easy-to-use environment for individual application scientists themselves to create their own workflows
* provide interactive tools for the scientists enabling them to execute their workflows and view their results in real-time
* simplify the process of sharing and reusing workflows between the scientists.
* enable scientists to track the [[provenance]] of the workflow execution results and the workflow creation steps.

Some of the platforms giving this service: [[Galaxy (computational biology)|Galaxy]], [[Kepler scientific workflow system|Kepler]], [[Taverna workbench|Taverna]], [[UGENE]],  [[Anduril (workflow engine)|Anduril]].

==Education platforms==
Software platforms designed to teach bioinformatics concepts and methods include [[Rosalind (education platform)|Rosalind]] and online courses offered through the [[Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics]] Training Portal. The [[Canadian Bioinformatics Workshops]] provides videos and slides from training workshops on their website under a [[Creative Commons]] license.

==Conferences==
There are several large conferences that are concerned with bioinformatics. Some of the most notable examples are [[Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology]] (ISMB), [[European Conference on Computational Biology]] (ECCB), [[Research in Computational Molecular Biology]] (RECOMB) and American Society of Mass Spectrometry (ASMS).
