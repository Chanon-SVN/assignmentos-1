'''''Banacek''''' (pronounced &quot;BAN-a-check&quot;) is an American detective [[Television programs|TV series]] starring [[George Peppard]] that aired on the [[NBC]] network from 1972 to 1974. The series was part of the rotating ''[[NBC Mystery Movie|NBC Wednesday Mystery Movie]]'' anthology. It alternated in its time slot with several other shows but was the only one to last beyond its first season.

==Premise==
Peppard played Thomas Banacek, a suave, [[Polish-American]] freelance [[Private investigator|investigator]] based in [[Boston]], who solved seemingly impossible thefts (see [[locked room mystery]]). He then collected from the insurance companies 10% of the insured value of the recovered property. One of Banacek's verbal signatures was the quotation of strangely worded yet curiously cogent &quot;[[Poland|Polish]]&quot; proverbs such as:
* &quot;If you're not sure that it's potato [[borscht]], there could be orphans working in the mines.&quot;
* &quot;Though the hippopotamus has no sting, the wise man would prefer to be sat upon by the bee.&quot;
* &quot;A truly wise man never plays leapfrog with a unicorn.&quot;
* &quot;If a wolf is after your sleigh throw him a raisin cookie—but don't stop to bake him a cake.&quot;
* &quot;Just because the cat has her kittens in the oven doesn't make them biscuits.&quot;
* &quot;You can read all the books in the library my son, but the cheese will still stink after four days.&quot;
* &quot;No matter how warm the smile on the face of the Sun, the cat still has her kittens under the porch.&quot;

Part of the joke was that Ralph Manza as Banacek's [[chauffeur]] Jay Drury, would often ask &quot;What does it mean, Boss?&quot; Banacek also had a running agreement with his chauffeur for a 10% share of Banacek's 10% if he solved the crime.  Mr. Drury was never at a loss for a potential solution which Banacek would always manage to shoot down with his very next line.  Another recurring gag was for other characters to mispronounce his name, often, particularly in the case of rivals, deliberately. The name &quot;Banaczek&quot; (as pronounced in the show) is actually quite rare in Poland.

Also featured were [[Murray Matheson]] as rare-bookstore owner and information source Felix Mulholland and [[Christine Belford]] as Carlie Kirkland, Banacek's sometime-lover and always-rival.

Banacek's success as an investigator allowed him to live well. He had a mansion at 85 Mt. Vernon Street, (the same house used in ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1968 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' starring [[Steve McQueen]]){{citation needed|date=September 2013}} on Beacon Hill in Boston.  He had a limousine and driver. He owned and drove an antique 1941 [[Packard]] convertible.  He had a [[mobile radio telephone]] in each of his cars at a time when these devices were uncommon and expensive.  Banacek was intelligent, well-educated, cultured and suave.  He was an unapologetic ladies man who enjoyed the company of beautiful women, but he was street-smart and could engage in violent hand-to-hand fighting if the moment called for it.

==Production==
In general the series was shot on the [[Universal Studios]] backlot, though location scenes were filmed around Los Angeles in areas that could pass for Boston, or rural areas near there.  The episode titled &quot;If Max Is So Smart, Why Doesn't He Tell Us Where He Is?&quot; was shot on location at the [[California Institute of the Arts]] around the time the school first opened. &quot;Ten Thousand Dollars A Page&quot; was filmed at the Pasadena Art Museum, later known as the Pasadena Museum of Modern Art and now the [[Norton Simon Museum of Art]].

A customized 1969 [[American Motors]] AMX was built by [[George Barris (auto customizer)|George Barris]] for the second regular season episode. The car became known as the [[AMC AMX#AMX-400|AMX-400]] and it is now owned by an automobile collector. Other continuing cars in the series were a 1941 [[Packard 180]] with a Victoria body designed by Howard &quot;Dutch&quot; Darrin (license plate number 178344), a 1973 Corvette (driven by Ms. Kirkland) and a 1973 [[Cadillac Fleetwood]] [[limousine]] ([[mobile telephone]] number KL 17811).  In keeping with both the exotic car theme and the humor between Banacek and his driver Jay Drury, he was even chauffeured around in an ancient [[Jeep]] and a brand new Ford / [[De Tomaso Pantera]]...

In preparation for both the pilot, first, and then the second seasons the cast went to Boston and filmed a variety of background scenes.  These scenes were then used through the series and are especially shown in the opening scenes including Banacek rowing on the [[Charles River]] and walking through [[Government Center, Boston|Government Center]].  In the pilot, Banacek's car pulls into his Beacon Hill home, the historic Second [[Harrison Gray Otis House]] located at 85 Mount Vernon Street. In other episodes, views are shown of the [[Public Garden (Boston)|Public Garden]], the entry to Felix's bookstore at 50 [[Beacon Street]], and the [[Esplanade, Boston|Esplanade]].  The Boston filmed pieces were done by a [[second unit]] and directed by Peppard himself.

==Reception==
Although the show had a mixture of humor and rather intricate plots, it never generated strong ratings. Despite this, the show was well received by critics. In addition, the [[Polish American Congress]] gave the series an award for portraying Polish Americans in a good manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946–Present|year=2003|publisher=Ballantine Books|isbn=0-345-45542-8|pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancellation==
''Banacek'' was well received by television critics, and as a result was picked up for a third season. However, before the third season could start, Peppard quit the show in order to prevent his ex-wife [[Elizabeth Ashley]] from receiving a larger percentage of his earnings as part of their divorce settlement. The complication ended any chance of reviving ''Banacek'' during Peppard's lifetime. [[A&amp;E (TV channel)|A&amp;E]] continued rebroadcasts of ''Banacek'' in syndication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~achaney/tmve/wiki100k/docs/Banacek.html|title=Banacek|publisher=|accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
