==Etymology==
Both the words accounting and accountancy were in use in [[Great Britain]] by the mid-1800s, and are derived from the words ''accompting'' and ''accountantship'' used in the 18th century.&lt;ref name = &quot;LN 2009&quot;&gt;Labardin, Pierre, and Marc Nikitin. 2009. “Accounting and the Words to Tell It: An Historical Perspective.” ''Accounting, Business &amp; Financial History'' 19 (2): 149–166.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Middle English]] (used roughly between the 12th and the late 15th century) the verb &quot;to account&quot; had the form ''accounten'', which was derived from the Old French word ''aconter'',&lt;ref name = &quot;B 1984&quot;&gt;Baladouni, Vahé. 1984. “Etymological Observations on Some Accounting Terms.” ''The Accounting Historians Journal'' 11 (2): 101–109.&lt;/ref&gt; which is in turn related to the [[Vulgar Latin]] word ''computare'', meaning &quot;to reckon&quot;. The base of ''computare'' is ''putare'', which &quot;variously meant to prune, to purify, to correct an account, hence, to count or calculate, as well as to think.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;B 1984&quot;/&gt;

The word &quot;[[accountant]]&quot; is derived from the French word {{lang|fr|''compter''}}, which is also derived from the [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|''computare''}}. The word was formerly written in English as &quot;accomptant&quot;, but in process of time the word, which was always pronounced by dropping the &quot;p&quot;, became gradually changed both in [[pronunciation]] and in [[orthography]] to its present form.&lt;ref&gt;Pixley, Francis William: Accountancy—constructive and recording accountancy (Sir Isaac Pitman &amp; Sons, Ltd, London, 1900), p4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Topics ==
Accounting has several subfields or subject areas, including [[financial accounting]], [[management accounting]], [[auditing]], [[taxation]] and [[accounting information system]]s.&lt;ref name = &quot;WC 1981&quot;&gt;Weber, Richard P., and W.

===Financial accounting===
{{main|Financial accounting}}
Financial accounting focuses on the reporting of an organization's financial information to external users of the information, such as [[investor]]s, [[Regulatory agency|regulators]] and [[Supply chain|suppliers]]. It measures and records business transactions and prepares [[financial statement]]s for the external users in accordance with [[generally accepted accounting principles]] (GAAP).&lt;ref name = &quot;HDF 2006&quot;&gt;{{Citation

Financial accounting produces past-oriented reports—for example the financial statements prepared in 2006 reports on performance in 2005—on an [[Annual report|annual]] or quarterly basis, generally about the organization as a whole.&lt;ref name = &quot;HDF 2006&quot; /&gt;

===Management accounting===
{{main|Management accounting}}
Management accounting focuses on the measurement, analysis and reporting of information that can help managers in making decisions to fulfil the goals of an organization. In management accounting, internal measures and reports are based on [[cost-benefit analysis]], and are not required to follow GAAP.&lt;ref name = &quot;HDF 2006&quot; /&gt;

Management accounting produces future-oriented reports—for example the budget for 2006 is prepared in 2005—and the time span of reports varies widely. Such reports may include both financial and nonfinancial information, and may, for example, focus on specific products and departments.&lt;ref name = &quot;HDF 2006&quot; /&gt;

===Auditing===
{{main|Financial audit|Internal audit}}
Auditing is the verification of assertions made by others regarding a payoff,&lt;ref name = &quot;B 1979&quot;&gt;Baiman, Stanley. 1979. “Discussion of Auditing: Incentives and Truthful Reporting.” Journal of Accounting Research 17: 25–29.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the context of accounting it is the &quot;[[wiktionary:unbiased|unbiased]] examination and evaluation of the financial statements of an organization&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;I 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/audit.asp |title=Audit Definition |year=2013 |website=Investopedia |publisher= Investopedia US |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An audit of financial statements aims to express or disclaim an opinion on the financial statements. The auditor expresses an opinion on the fairness with which the financial statements presents the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of an entity, in accordance with GAAP and &quot;in all material respects&quot;. An auditor is also required to identify circumstances in which GAAP has not been consistently observed.&lt;ref name = &quot;SAS 1 Responsibilities&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aicpa.org/Research/Standards/AuditAttest/DownloadableDocuments/AU-00110.pdf |title=Responsibilities and Functions of the Independent Auditor |date=November 1972 |website=AICPA |publisher=AICPA |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax accounting===
{{main|Tax accounting}}
U.S. tax accounting concentrates on the preparation, analysis and presentation of tax payments and tax returns.

=== Accounting firms ===
{{main|Accounting networks and associations}}
Depending on its size, a company may be legally required to have their [[financial statement]]s [[auditing|audited]] by a qualified auditor, and audits are usually carried out by [[Accounting networks and associations|accounting firms]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Parliament Auditors 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldselect/ldeconaf/119/11904.htm |title= Auditors: Market concentration and their role, CHAPTER 1: Introduction  |year=2011 |website=UK Parliament |publisher=House of Lords |accessdate=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounting firms grew in the United States and Europe in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, and through several mergers there were large international accounting firms by the mid-twentieth century. Further large mergers in the late twentieth century led to the dominance by the auditing market by the [[Big Four (audit firms)#Big 5|Big Five]] accounting firms: [[Arthur Andersen]], [[Deloitte]], [[Ernst &amp; Young]], [[KPMG]] and [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Parliament Auditors 2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201011/ldselect/ldeconaf/119/11905.htm |title= Auditors: Market concentration and their role, CHAPTER 2: Concentration in the audit market   |year=2011 |website=UK Parliament |publisher=House of Lords |accessdate=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Arthur Andersen#Demise|demise of Arthur Andersen]] following the [[Enron scandal]] reduced the Big Five to the [[Big Four (audit firms)|Big Four]].&lt;ref name = &quot;FT Big Four&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=big-four |title= Definition of big four  |year=2014 |website=Financial Times Lexicon |publisher=The Financial Times Ltd |accessdate=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Standard-setters ===
{{See also|Accounting standards|Convergence of accounting standards}}
[[Generally accepted accounting principles]] (GAAP) are accounting standards issued by national regulatory bodies. In addition, the [[International Accounting Standards Board]] (IASB) issues the [[International Financial Reporting Standards]] (IFRS) implemented by 147 countries.&lt;ref name = &quot;NP 2013&quot; /&gt; While standards for international audit and assurance, ethics, education, and public sector accounting are all set by independent standard settings boards supported by IFAC. The International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board sets international standards for auditing, assurance, and quality control; the [[International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants]] (IESBA) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifac.org/ethics] Ethics&lt;/ref&gt; sets the internationally appropriate principles- based ''Code of Ethics for Professional Accounts'' the [[International Accounting Education Standards Board]] (IAESB) sets professional accounting education standards;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifac.org/education] Education&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Public Sector Accounting Standards]] Board (IPSASB) sets accrual-based international public sector accounting standards &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifac.org/public-sector] Public Sector.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations in individual countries may issue accounting standards unique to the countries. For example, in the [[United States]] the [[Financial Accounting Standards Board]] (FASB) issues the Statements of Financial Accounting Standards, which form the basis of [[US GAAP]],&lt;ref name = &quot;NP 2013&quot; /&gt; and in the [[United Kingdom]] the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) sets accounting standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICAEW Standards&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url =http://www.icaew.com/en/library/subject-gateways/accounting-standards/knowledge-guide-to-uk-accounting-standards | title = Knowledge guide to UK Accounting Standards | publisher =ICAEW | year=2014 | accessdate =January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However,as of 2012 &quot;all major economies&quot; have plans to [[Convergence (accounting)|converge]] towards or adopt the IFRS.&lt;ref name=globalcon /&gt;

== Accounting research ==
{{Main|Accounting research}}
Accounting research is [[research]] on the effects of economic events on the process of accounting, and the effects of reported information on economic events. It encompasses a broad range of research areas including [[financial accounting]], [[management accounting]], [[auditing]] and [[taxation]].&lt;ref name = &quot;OOS 2010&quot;&gt;Oler, Derek K., Mitchell J. Oler, and Christopher J. Skousen. 2010. “Characterizing Accounting Research.” ''Accounting Horizons'' 24 (4): 635–670.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounting research is carried out both by academic researchers and practicing accountants. Academic accounting research &quot;addresses all aspects of the accounting profession&quot; using the [[scientific method]], while research by practicing accountants focuses on solving problems for a client or group of clients.&lt;ref name=&quot;GP 2009&quot;&gt;Gordon, Teresa P., and Jason C. Porter. 2009. &quot;Reading and Understanding Academic Research in Accounting: A Guide for Students.&quot; ''Global Perspectives on Accounting Education'' 6: 25-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Academic accounting research can make significant contribution to accounting practice,&lt;ref name = &quot;GP 2009&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;ACCA 2010&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url =http://www.accaglobal.com/content/dam/acca/global/PDF-technical/human-capital/rr-120-002.pdf | title =The Relevance and Utility of Leading Accounting Research | publisher =The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, | year =2010 | accessdate =December 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although changes in accounting [[education]] and the accounting academia in recent decades has led to a divide between academia and practice in accounting.&lt;ref name = &quot;GBE 2011&quot;&gt;Guthrie, J., Roger Burritt and Elaine Evans. 2011. &quot;The Relationship between Academic Accounting Research and Professional Practice,&quot; in Bridging the Gap between Academic Accounting Research and Professional Practice, eds. Elaine Evans, Roger Burritt and James Guthrie. (New South Wales: The Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Methodology|Methodologies]] in academic accounting research can be classified into archival research, which examines &quot;objective data collected from [[Information repository|repositories]]&quot;; experimental research, which examines data &quot;the researcher gathered by [[Scientific control#Controlled experiments|administering treatments to subjects]]&quot;; and analytical research, which is &quot;based on the act of [[Scientific modelling|formally modeling]] [[theories]] or substantiating ideas in mathematical terms&quot;. This classification is not exhaustive; other possible methodologies include the use of [[case studies]], [[computer simulations]] and [[field research]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CSWW 2010&quot;&gt;Coyne, Joshua G., Scott L. Summers, Brady Williams, and David a. Wood. 2010. “Accounting Program Research Rankings by Topical Area and Methodology.” ''Issues in Accounting Education'' 25 (4) (November): 631–654.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accounting and computer software==
{{See also|Accounting information system}}
Many laborious practices have been simplified with the help of computer software. [[Enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) software provides a comprehensive, centralized, integrated source of information that companies can use to manage all major business processes, from purchasing to manufacturing to human resources. This software can replace up to 200 individual software programs that were previously used. Computer integrated manufacturing allows products to be made and completely untouched by human hands and can increase production by having fewer errors in the manufacturing process.

Computers have reduced the cost of accumulating, storing, and reporting managerial accounting information and have made it possible to produce a more detailed account of all data that is entered into any given system. They have also changed business to business interaction through e-commerce. Rather than dealing with multiple companies to purchase products, a business can purchase a product at a less expensive price and take out the third party and vastly reduces expenses companies once accrued.

Additionally, Inter-organizational information system enable suppliers and businesses to be connected at all times. When a company is low on a product the supplier will be notified and fulfill an order immediately which eliminates the need for someone to do inventory, fill out the proper documents, send them out and wait for their products.&lt;ref&gt;accounting, Tools for Business Decision Making, by Kimmel, Paul D., Jerry J. Weygandt and Donald E. Kieso (Fourth Edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accounting affects the economy==

Although financial accounting produces past-oriented reports, it is based on generally accepted accounting principles and generally accepted accounting practices compliant with International Financial Reporting Standards/US GAAP. In order to prepare the financial accounts/reports an entity has to comply with these GAAPs and gaaps. Which of these accounting practices and principles the board of directors choose at the start of the financial period and whatever changes in these generally accepted accounting principles and practices are implemented during the accounting period, affect the entity´s economy and affect the financial accounts (financial reports) prepared at the end of the financial period. When all entities implement the same change during the financial year as required by IFRS/US GAAP, then that affects the entire economy.

==Accounting scandals==
{{Main|Accounting scandals}}
{{See also|Accounting ethics}}
The year 2001 witnessed a series of financial information frauds involving [[Enron]], auditing firm [[Arthur Andersen]], the telecommunications company [[WorldCom]], [[Qwest]] and [[Jarden|Sunbeam]], among other well-known corporations. These problems highlighted the need to review the effectiveness of [[Standard accounting practice|accounting standards]], auditing regulations and [[corporate governance]] principles. In some cases, management manipulated the figures shown in financial reports to indicate a better economic performance. In others, tax and regulatory incentives encouraged over-leveraging of companies and decisions to bear extraordinary and unjustified risk.&lt;ref name=&quot;mba.ufm.edu.gt&quot;&gt;Astrid Ayala and Giancarlo Ibárgüen Snr.: &quot;A Market Proposal for Auditing the Financial Statements of Public Companies&quot; (Journal of Management of Value, [[Universidad Francisco Marroquín]], March 2006) p. 41, [http://www.mba.ufm.edu.gt/journalofmanagement/content/ENG_MarketProposal.pdf UFM.edu.gt]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Enron scandal]] deeply influenced the development of new regulations to improve the reliability of financial reporting, and increased public awareness about the importance of having accounting standards that show the financial reality of companies and the objectivity and independence of auditing firms.&lt;ref name=&quot;mba.ufm.edu.gt&quot;/&gt;

In addition to being the largest bankruptcy reorganization in American history, the [[Enron scandal]] undoubtedly is the biggest audit failure.&lt;ref&gt;Bratton, William W. &quot;Enron and the Dark Side of Shareholder Value&quot; ([[Tulane Law Review]], New Orleans, May 2002) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; It involved a financial scandal of [[Enron|Enron Corporation]] and their auditors [[Arthur Andersen]], which was revealed in late 2001. The scandal caused the dissolution of [[Arthur Andersen]], which at the time was one of the five largest accounting firms in the world.  After a series of revelations involving irregular accounting procedures conducted throughout the 1990s, Enron filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection in December 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Enron files for bankruptcy | publisher = BBC News | date = 2001-12-03 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1688550.stm | accessdate = 2008-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One consequence of these events was the passage of [[Sarbanes–Oxley Act]] in the [[United States]] 2002, as a result of the first admissions of fraudulent behavior made by Enron. The act significantly raises criminal penalties for [[securities fraud]], for destroying, altering or fabricating records in federal investigations or any scheme or attempt to defraud shareholders.&lt;ref&gt;Aiyesha Dey, and Thomas Z. Lys: &quot;Trends in Earnings Management and Informativeness of Earnings Announcements in the Pre- and Post-Sarbanes Oxley Periods ([[Kellogg School of Management]], Evanston, Illinois, February, 2005) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
