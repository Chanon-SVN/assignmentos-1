=== Biography ===

[[File:Alhazen, the Persian.gif|thumb|Alhazen, the polymath]]
Born c. 965 in [[Basra]], which was then part of the [[Buyid dynasty|Buyid emirate]],&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{harv|Lorch|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; to an [[Arab people|Arab]] family.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibn al-Haytham'', J. Vernet, '''The Encyclopaedia of Islam''', Vol. III, ed. B. Lewis, V.L. Menage, C. Pellat, J. Schacht (Brill, 1996), 788;&quot; ''&quot;IBN AL-HAYXHAM, B. AL-HAYTHAM AL-BASRI, AL-MisRl, was identified towards the end of the 19th century with the ALHAZEN, AVENNATHAN and AVENETAN of mediaeval Latin texts.''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David J. Hess, ''Science and Technology in a Multicultural World: The Cultural Politics of Facts and Artifacts'', (Columbia University Press, 1995), page 66;&quot;''It is known that Galileo had a copy of &quot;Opticae Thesaurus&quot; of Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen), an Arab scholar who is praised today for his experimental method, although views on what this method entails and which importance it has in Ibn al-Haytham's work differ. (Omar 1979:68).''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

He arrived in Cairo under the reign of [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] Caliph [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|al-Hakim]], a patron of the sciences who was particularly interested in astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rashed|2002b}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn al-Haytham has proposed to the Caliph a [[Hydraulic empire|hydraulic project]] to improve regulation of the [[flooding of the Nile]], a task requiring an early attempt at building a [[dam]] at the present site of the [[Aswan Dam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rashed|2002b}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His field work convinced him of the technical impracticality of this scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Corbin|first=Henry|author-link=Henry Corbin|title=History of Islamic Philosophy, Translated by Liadain Sherrard, [[Philip Sherrard]] |publisher=London; Kegan Paul International in association with Islamic Publications for The Institute of Ismaili Studies|date=1993; original French 1964|isbn=0-7103-0416-1|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Haytham continued to live in Cairo, in the neighborhood of the famous University of al-Azhar, until his death after 1040.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corbin149&quot;/&gt; Legend has it that after deciding the scheme was impractical and fearing the [[caliph]]'s anger, Alhazen [[feigned madness]] and was kept under [[house arrest]] from 1011 until al-Hakim's death in 1021.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cgie.org.ir/shavad.asp?id=123&amp;avaid=1917 |title=the Great Islamic Encyclopedia |publisher=Cgie.org.ir |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he wrote his influential ''[[Book of Optics]]'' and continued to write further treatises on astronomy, geometry, number theory, optics and natural philosophy. 

Among his students were ''Sorkhab'' (''Sohrab''), a [[Persian people|Persian]] from [[Iran]]'s [[Semnan (city)|Semnan]] who was his student for over 3 years, and ''Abu al-Wafa Mubashir ibn Fatek,'' an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] prince who learned mathematics from Alhazan.&lt;ref name=greatislamic&gt;Sajjadi, Sadegh, &quot;Alhazen&quot;, ''Great Islamic Encyclopedia'', Volume 1, Article No. 1917;&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhazen made significant contributions to optics, number theory, geometry, astronomy and natural philosophy. Alhazen's work on optics is credited with contributing a new emphasis on experiment. 

His main work, ''Kitab al-Manazir'' (''Book of Optics'') was known in Islamicate societies mainly, but not exclusively, through the thirteenth-century commentary by [[Kamāl al-Dīn al-Fārisī]], the ''Tanqīḥ ''al-Manāẓir'' li-dhawī l-abṣār wa l-baṣā'ir''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sabra|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[al-Andalus]], it was used by the eleventh-century prince of the Banu Hud dynasty of Zaragossa and author of an important mathematical text, [[al-Mu'taman ibn Hud|al-Mu'taman ibn Hūd]]. A Latin translation of the ''Kitab al-Manazir'' was made probably in the late twelfth or early thirteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sabra|2007|pages=122, 128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|1974}} {{google books|id=fAPN_3w4hAUC|p=392}} notes the ''Book of Optics'' has also been denoted as ''Opticae Thesaurus Alhazen Arabis'', as ''De Aspectibus'', and also as ''Perspectiva''&lt;/ref&gt;  This translation was read by and greatly influenced a number of scholars in Catholic Europe including: [[Roger Bacon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lindberg|1996|p=11}}, passim&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Grosseteste]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Early Days of X-ray Crystallography|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191635021|page=23|author=André Authier|chapter=3: The Dual Nature of Light|quote=Alhazen's works in turn inspired many scientists of the Middle Ages, such as the English bishop, Robert Grosseteste (ca 1175–1253), and the English Franciscan, Roger Bacon (ca 1214–1294), Erazmus Ciolek Witelo, or Witelon (ca 1230* 1280), a Silesian-born Polish friar, philosopher and scholar, published in ca 1270 a treatise on optics, Perspectiva, largely based on Alhazen's works.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Witelo]], [[Giambattista della Porta]],&lt;ref name=Aves&gt;{{cite book|title=Dictionary of World Biography, Volume 2|year=1998|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781579580414|page=66|author=Frank Northen Magill|author2=Alison Aves|chapter=The Middles Ages: Alhazen|quote=Roger Bacon, John Peckham, and Giambattista della Porta are only some of the many thinkers who were influenced by Alhazen's work.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonardo Da Vinci]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=4D Electron Microscopy: Imaging in Space and Time|year=2010|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9781848163904|page=5|author=Ahmed H.

Alhazen's most famous work is his seven-volume treatise on [[optics]] ''Kitab al-Manazir'' (''Book of Optics''), written from 1011 to 1021.

''Optics'' was [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] by an unknown scholar at the end of the 12th century or the beginning of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Crombie|1971|p=147, n. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was printed by [[Friedrich Risner]] in 1572, with the title ''Opticae thesaurus: Alhazeni Arabis libri septem, nuncprimum editi; Eiusdem liber De Crepusculis et nubium ascensionibus'' (English : Optics treasure: Arab Alhazeni seven books, published for the first time: The book of the Twilight of the clouds and ascensions).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.mala.bc.ca/~mcneil/cit/citlcalhazen1.htm|title=Alhazen (965–1040): Library of Congress Citations|publisher=Malaspina Great Books|accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risner is also the author of the name variant &quot;Alhazen&quot;; before Risner he was known in the west as Alhacen, which is the correct transcription of the Arabic name.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Smith|2001|p=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work enjoyed a great reputation during the [[Middle Ages]]. Works by Alhazen on geometric subjects were discovered in the [[Bibliothèque nationale]] in [[Paris]] in 1834 by E. A. Sedillot. Other manuscripts are preserved in the [[Bodleian Library]] at [[Oxford]] and in the library of [[Leiden]].

=== Theory of vision ===

[[File:Al-Alim al-Arabiy al-Hasan bin al-Haytham (the Arab Scientist al-Hasan bin al-Haytham).jpg|thumbnail|400px|Alhazen on Iraqi 10 dinars]]
Two major theories on vision prevailed in [[classical antiquity]]. The first theory, the [[Emission theory (vision)|emission theory]], was supported by such thinkers as [[Euclid]] and [[Ptolemy]], who believed that sight worked by the eye emitting [[Ray (optics)|rays]] of [[light]]. The second theory, the intromission theory supported by [[Aristotle]] and his followers, had physical forms entering the eye from an object. Previous Islamic writers (such as [[al-Kindi]]) had argued essentially on Euclidean, Galenist, or Aristotelian lines; Alhazen's achievement was to come up with a theory which successfully combined parts of the mathematical ray arguments of Euclid, the medical tradition of [[Galen]], and the intromission theories of Aristotle. Alhazen's intromission theory followed al-Kindi (and broke with Aristotle) in asserting that &quot;from each point of every colored body, illuminated by any light, issue light and color along every straight line that can be drawn from that point&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindberg 1976 73&quot;&gt;{{harv|Lindberg|1976|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; This however left him with the problem of explaining how a coherent image was formed from many independent sources of radiation; in particular, every point of an object would send rays to every point on the eye. What Alhazen needed was for each point on an object to correspond to one point only on the eye.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindberg 1976 73&quot;/&gt; He attempted to resolve this by asserting that only perpendicular rays from the object would be perceived by the eye; for any one point on the eye, only the ray which reached it directly, without being refracted by any other part of the eye, would be perceived. He argued using a physical analogy that perpendicular rays were stronger than oblique rays; in the same way that a ball thrown directly at a board might break the board, whereas a ball thrown obliquely at the board would glance off, perpendicular rays were stronger than refracted rays, and it was only perpendicular rays which were perceived by the eye. As there was only one perpendicular ray that would enter the eye at any one point, and all these rays would converge on the centre of the eye in a cone, this allowed him to resolve the problem of each point on an object sending many rays to the eye; if only the perpendicular ray mattered, then he had a one-to-one correspondence and the confusion could be resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lindberg|1976|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later asserted (in book seven of the ''Optics'') that other rays would be refracted through the eye and perceived ''as if'' perpendicular.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lindberg|1976|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His arguments regarding perpendicular rays do not clearly explain why ''only'' perpendicular rays were perceived; why would the weaker oblique rays not be perceived more weakly?&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lindberg|1976|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; His later argument that refracted rays would be perceived as if perpendicular does not seem persuasive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lindberg|1976|pages=76–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite its weaknesses, no other theory of the time was so comprehensive, and it was enormously influential, particularly in Western Europe: &quot;Directly or indirectly, his ''De Aspectibus'' inspired much of the activity in optics which occurred between the 13th and 17th centuries.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Lindberg 1976 86&quot;&gt;{{harv|Lindberg|1976|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kepler]]'s later theory of the [[retina]]l image (which resolved the problem of the correspondence of points on an object and points in the eye) built directly on the conceptual framework of Alhazen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lindberg 1976 86&quot;/&gt;

Alhazen showed through experiment that light travels in straight lines, and carried out various experiments with [[lens (optics)|lenses]], [[mirror]]s, [[refraction]], and [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]].&lt;ref name=Deek/&gt; He was the
first to consider separately the vertical and horizontal components of reflected and refracted light rays, which was an important step in understanding optics geometrically.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Heeffer|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[camera obscura]] was known to the Chinese, and Aristotle had discussed the principle behind it in his ''Problems'', however it is Alhazen's work which contains the first clear description&lt;ref name=Kelley&gt;{{harv|Kelley|Milone|Aveni|2005|p=83}}: {{quote|&quot;The first clear description of the device appears in the ''Book of Optics'' of Alhazen.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and early analysis&lt;ref name=Wade&gt;{{harv|Wade|Finger|2001}}: {{quote|&quot;The principles of the camera obscura first began to be correctly analysed in the eleventh century, when they were outlined by Ibn al-Haytham.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the device.

Alhazen studied the process of sight, the structure of the eye, image formation in the eye, and the [[visual system]]. Ian P. Howard argued in a 1996 ''[[Perception (journal)|Perception]]'' article that Alhazen should be credited with many discoveries and theories which were previously attributed to Western Europeans writing centuries later. For example, he described what became in the 19th century [[Hering's law of equal innervation]]; he had a description of vertical [[horopter]]s which predates [[Aguilonius]] by 600 years and is actually closer to the modern definition than Aguilonius's; and his work on [[binocular disparity]] was repeated by Panum in 1858.&lt;ref name=Howard&gt;{{harv|Howard|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craig Aaen-Stockdale, while agreeing that Alhazen should be credited with many advances, has expressed some caution, especially when considering Alhazen in isolation from [[Ptolemy]], who Alhazen was extremely familiar with. Alhazen corrected a significant error of Ptolemy regarding binocular vision, but otherwise his account is very similar; Ptolemy also attempted to explain what is now called Hering's law.&lt;ref name=&quot;AaenStockdale&quot;/&gt; In general, Alhazen built on and expanded the optics of Ptolemy.&lt;ref name=Wade-1998&gt;{{harv|Wade|1998|pages=240,316,334,367}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Howard-Wade-1996&gt;{{harv|Howard|Wade|1996|pages=1195,1197,1200}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more detailed account of Ibn al-Haytham's contribution to the study of binocular vision based on Lejeune&lt;ref name=Lejeune&gt;{{harv|Lejeune|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sabra,&lt;ref name=Sabra&gt;{{harv|Sabra|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raynaud&lt;ref name=Raynaud&gt;{{harv|Raynaud|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the concepts of correspondence, homonymous and crossed diplopia were in place in Ibn al-Haytham's optics. But contrary to Howard, he explained why Ibn al-Haytham did not give the circular figure of the horopter and why, by reasoning experimentally, he was in fact closer to the discovery of Panum's fusional area than that of the Vieth-Müller circle. In this regard, Ibn al-Haytham's theory of binocular vision faced two main limits: the lack of recognition of the role of the retina, and obviously the lack of an experimental investigation of ocular tracts.

Alhazen's most original contribution was that after describing how he thought the eye was anatomically constructed, he went on to consider how this anatomy would behave functionally as an optical system.&lt;ref&gt;Gul A. Russell, &quot;Emergence of Physiological Optics&quot;, p. 691, in {{harv|Morelon|Rashed|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; His understanding of pinhole projection from his experiments appears to have influenced his consideration of image inversion in the eye,&lt;ref name=Russell-689&gt;Gul A. Russell, &quot;Emergence of Physiological Optics&quot;, p. 689, in {{harv|Morelon|Rashed|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he sought to avoid.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Lindberg|1976|pages= 80–85}}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that the rays that fell perpendicularly on the lens (or glacial humor as he called it) were further refracted outward as they left the glacial humor and the resulting image thus passed upright into the optic nerve at the back of the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Smith|2004|pages=186, 192}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He followed [[Galen]] in believing that the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]] was the receptive organ of sight, although some of his work hints that he thought the [[retina]] was also involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Wade|1998|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scientific method ===

{{Rquote|right|The duty of the man who investigates the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, is to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and,.. attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency.|Alhazen|&lt;ref name=Sabra/&gt;}}

An aspect associated with Alhazen's optical research is related to systemic and methodological reliance on experimentation (''i'tibar'')(Arabic: إعتبار) and [[Scientific control|controlled testing]] in his scientific inquiries.  Moreover, his experimental directives rested on combining classical physics (''ilm tabi'i'') with mathematics (''ta'alim''; geometry in particular). This mathematical-physical approach to experimental science supported most of his propositions in ''Kitab al-Manazir'' (''The Optics''; ''De aspectibus'' or ''Perspectivae'') and grounded his theories of vision, light and colour, as well as his research in catoptrics and [[dioptrics]] (the study of the refraction of light).&lt;ref name=Bizri-2005&gt;{{harv|El-Bizri|2005a}} &lt;br/&gt; {{harv|El-Bizri|2005b}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bradley Steffens]] in his book ''Ibn Al-Haytham: First Scientist'' has argued that Alhazen's approach to testing and experimentation made an important contribution to the scientific method. According to Matthias Schramm, Alhazen: &lt;blockquote&gt;was the first to make a systematic use of the method of varying the experimental conditions in a constant and uniform manner, in an experiment showing that the intensity of the light-spot formed by the projection of the [[moonlight]] through two small [[apertures]] onto a screen diminishes constantly as one of the apertures is gradually blocked up.&lt;ref name=Toomer-463-4&gt;{{harv|Toomer|1964|pp=463–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; G. J. Toomer expressed some skepticism regarding Schramm's view, arguing that caution is needed to avoid reading anachronistically particular passages in Alhazen's very large body of work, and while acknowledging Alhazen's importance in developing experimental techniques, argued that he should not be considered in isolation from other Islamic and ancient thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Toomer|1964|p=465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alhazen's problem ===
{{main|Alhazen's problem}}
His work on [[catoptrics]] in Book V of the Book of Optics contains a discussion of what is now known as Alhazen's problem, first formulated by [[Ptolemy]] in 150 AD. It comprises drawing lines from two points in the [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] of a circle meeting at a point on the [[circumference]] and making equal angles with the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] at that point. This is equivalent to finding the point on the edge of a circular [[billiard table]] at which a cue ball at a given point must be aimed in order to carom off the edge of the table and hit another ball at a second given point. Thus, its main application in optics is to solve the problem, &quot;Given a light source and a spherical mirror, find the point on the mirror where the light will be reflected to the eye of an observer.&quot; This leads to an [[Quartic equation|equation of the fourth degree]].&lt;ref name=MacTutor/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Weisstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; This eventually led Alhazen to derive a formula for the sum of [[fourth power]]s, where previously only the formulas for the sums of squares and cubes had been stated. His method can be readily generalized to find the formula for the sum of any integral powers, although he did not himself do this (perhaps because he only needed the fourth power to calculate the volume of the paraboloid he was interested in). He used his result on sums of integral powers to perform what would now be called an [[Integral|integration]], where the formulas for the sums of integral squares and fourth powers allowed him to calculate the volume of a [[paraboloid]].&lt;ref name=Katz&gt;{{harv|Katz|1995|pp=165–9 &amp; 173–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alhazen eventually solved the problem using [[conic section]]s and a geometric proof. His solution was extremely long and complicated and may not have been understood by mathematicians reading him in Latin translation. Later mathematicians used [[Descartes]]' analytical methods to analyse the problem,&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{harv|Smith|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a new solution being found in 1997 by the Oxford mathematician [[Peter M. Neumann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Highfield|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, [[Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories]] (MERL) researchers Amit Agrawal, Yuichi Taguchi and Srikumar Ramalingam solved the extension of Alhazen's problem to general rotationally symmetric quadric mirrors including hyperbolic, parabolic and elliptical mirrors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Agrawal|Taguchi|Ramalingam|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They showed that the mirror reflection point can be computed by solving an eighth degree equation in the most general case. If the camera (eye) is placed on the axis of the mirror, the degree of the equation reduces to six.&lt;ref name=AgrawalECCV10&gt;{{harv|Agrawal|Taguchi|Ramalingam|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alhazen's problem can also be extended to multiple refractions from a spherical ball. Given a light source and a spherical ball of certain refractive index, the closest point on the spherical ball where the light is refracted to the eye of the observer can be obtained by solving a tenth degree equation.&lt;ref name=AgrawalECCV10/&gt;

=== Other contributions ===

The Kitab al-Manazir (Book of Optics) describes several experimental observations that Alhazen made and how he used his results to explain certain optical phenomena using mechanical analogies. He conducted experiments with [[projectile]]s, and a description of his conclusions is: &quot;it was only the impact of [[perpendicular]] projectiles on surfaces which was forceful enough to enable them to penetrate whereas the [[Oblique angle|oblique]] ones were deflected. For example, to explain refraction from a rare to a dense medium, he used the mechanical analogy of an iron ball thrown at a thin slate covering a wide hole in a metal sheet. A perpendicular throw would break the slate and pass through, whereas an oblique one with equal force and from an equal distance would not.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell&quot;&gt;Gul A. Russell, &quot;Emergence of Physiological Optics&quot;, p. 695, in {{Citation |last1=Morelon  |first1=Régis |last2=Rashed |first2=Roshdi |year=1996 |title=[[Encyclopedia of the History of Arabic Science]] |volume=2 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0-415-12410-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also used this result to explain how intense, direct light hurts the eye, using a mechanical analogy: &quot;Alhazen associated 'strong' lights with perpendicular rays and 'weak' lights with oblique ones. The obvious answer to the problem of multiple rays and the eye was in the choice of the perpendicular ray since there could only be one such ray from each point on the surface of the object which could penetrate the eye.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell&quot;/&gt;

Sudanese psychologist Omar Khaleefa has argued that Alhazen should be considered be the &quot;founder of [[experimental psychology]]&quot;, for his pioneering work on the psychology of visual perception and [[optical illusion]]s.&lt;ref name=Khaleefa&gt;{{harv|Khaleefa|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khaleefa has also argued that Alhazen should also be considered the &quot;founder of [[psychophysics]]&quot;, a sub-discipline and precursor to modern psychology.&lt;ref name=Khaleefa/&gt; Although Alhazen made many subjective reports regarding vision, there is no evidence that he used quantitative psychophysical techniques and the claim has been rebuffed.&lt;ref name=AaenStockdale&gt;{{harv|Aaen-Stockdale|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhazen offered an explanation of the [[Moon illusion]], an illusion that played an important role in the scientific tradition of medieval Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, H.E. and Plug, C. (2002) ''The mystery of the moon illusion: Exploring size perception''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many authors repeated explanations that attempted to solve the problem of the Moon appearing larger near the horizon than it does when higher up in the sky, a debate that is still unresolved. Alhazen argued against Ptolemy's refraction theory, and defined the problem in terms of perceived, rather than real, enlargement. He said that judging the distance of an object depends on there being an uninterrupted sequence of intervening bodies between the object and the observer. When the Moon is high in the sky there are no intervening objects, so the Moon appears close. The perceived size of an object of constant angular size varies with its perceived distance. Therefore, the Moon appears closer and smaller high in the sky, and further and larger on the horizon. Through works by [[Roger Bacon]], [[John Pecham]] and Witelo based on Alhazen's explanation, the Moon illusion gradually came to be accepted as a psychological phenomenon, with the refraction theory being rejected in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hershenson|1989| pp=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Alhazen is often credited with the perceived distance explanation, he was not the first author to offer it. [[Cleomedes]] ({{circa}} 2nd century) gave this account (in addition to refraction), and he credited it to [[Posidonius]] ({{circa}} 135-50 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ross | first1 = H.E. | year = 2000 | title = Cleomedes ({{circa}} 1st century AD) on the celestial illusion, atmospheric enlargement and size-distance invariance | url = | journal = Perception | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 853–861 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ptolemy may also have offered this explanation in his ''Optics'', but the text is obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ross | first1 = H.E. | last2 = Ross | first2 = G.M. | year = 1976 | title = Did Ptolemy understand the moon illusion? | url = | journal = Perception | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 377–385 | doi=10.1068/p050377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alhazen's writings were more widely available in the Middle Ages than those of these earlier authors, and that probably explains why Alhazen received the credit.

== Other works on physics ==

=== Optical treatises ===

Besides the ''Book of Optics'', Alhazen wrote several other treatises on the same subject, including his ''Risala fi l-Daw’'' (''Treatise on Light''). He investigated the properties of [[luminance]], the [[rainbow]], [[eclipse]]s, twilight, and [[moonlight]]. Experiments with mirrors and [[Magnifying glass|magnifying lenses]] provided the foundation for his theories on [[catoptrics]].&lt;ref name=Bizri&gt;{{harv|El-Bizri|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his treatise ''Mizan al-Hikmah'' (''Balance of Wisdom''), Alhazen discussed the density of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and related it to [[altitude]]. He also studied [[atmospheric refraction]].&lt;ref name=Deek&gt;{{harv|Dr. Al Deek|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Celestial physics ===

Alhazen discussed the [[physics]] of the celestial region in his ''Epitome of Astronomy'', arguing that Ptolemaic models needed to be understood in terms of physical objects rather than abstract hypotheses; in other words that it should be possible to create physical models where (for example) none of the celestial bodies would collide with each other. The suggestion of mechanical models for the Earth centred [[Ptolemaic model]] &quot;greatly contributed to the eventual triumph of the Ptolemaic system among the Christians of the West&quot;. Alhazen's determination to root astronomy in the realm of physical objects was important however, because it meant astronomical hypotheses &quot;were accountable to the [[Physical law|laws of physics]]&quot;, and could be criticised and improved upon in those terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Duhem|1969|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Mizan al-Hikmah'' (''Balance of Wisdom''), Alhazen discussed the theories of [[Gravitation|attraction]] between [[mass]]es.&lt;ref name=Deek/&gt; He also wrote ''Maqala fi daw al-qamar'' (''On the Light of the Moon'').

=== Mechanics ===

In his work, Alhazen discussed theories on the [[Motion (physics)|motion]] of a body.&lt;ref name=Bizri/&gt; In his ''Treatise on Place'', Alhazen disagreed with [[Aristotle]]'s view that nature abhors a void, and he used [[geometry]] in an attempt to demonstrate that place (''al-makan'') is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body.&lt;ref name=Bizri-2007/&gt;

== Astronomical works ==

=== On the Configuration of the World ===

In his ''On the Configuration of the World'' Alhazen presented a detailed description of the physical structure of the earth:{{quote|The earth as a whole is a round sphere whose center is the center of the world. It is stationary in its [the world's] middle, fixed in it and not moving in any direction nor moving with any of the varieties of motion, but always at rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Langerman|1990}}, chap. 2, sect. 22, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The book is a non-technical explanation of Ptolemy's [[Almagest]], which was eventually translated into [[Hebrew]] and [[Latin]] in the 13th and 14th centuries and subsequently had an influence on astronomers such as [[Georg von Peuerbach]]&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; during the European [[Middle Ages]] and [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Langerman|1990|pp=34–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gondhalekar|2001|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Doubts Concerning Ptolemy ===

In his ''Al-Shukūk ‛alā Batlamyūs'', variously translated as ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'' or ''Aporias against Ptolemy'', published at some time between 1025 and 1028, Alhazen criticized [[Ptolemy]]'s ''Almagest'', ''Planetary Hypotheses'', and ''Optics'', pointing out various contradictions he found in these works, particularly in astronomy. Ptolemy's ''Almagest'' concerned mathematical theories regarding the motion of the planets, whereas the ''Hypotheses'' concerned what Ptolemy thought was the actual configuration of the planets. Ptolemy himself acknowledged that his theories and configurations did not always agree with each other, arguing that this was not a problem provided it did not result in noticeable error, but Alhazen was particularly scathing in his criticism of the inherent contradictions in Ptolemy's works.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sabra 1998&quot;&gt;{{harv|Sabra|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considered that some of the mathematical devices Ptolemy introduced into astronomy, especially the [[equant]], failed to satisfy the physical requirement of uniform circular motion, and noted the absurdity of relating actual physical motions to imaginary mathematical points, lines and circles:&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Langerman|1990|pp=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Ptolemy assumed an arrangement (''hay'a'') that cannot exist, and the fact that this arrangement produces in his imagination the motions that belong to the planets does not free him from the error he committed in his assumed arrangement, for the existing motions of the planets cannot be the result of an arrangement that is impossible to exist...  [F]or a man to imagine a circle in the heavens, and to imagine the planet moving in it does not bring about the planet's motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sabra|1978b|p=121, n. 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/copernicus|title=Nicolaus Copernicus|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date=2005-04-18|accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Having pointed out the problems, Alhazen appears to have intended to resolve the contradictions he pointed out in Ptolemy in a later work. Alhazen's belief was that there was a &quot;true configuration&quot; of the planets which Ptolemy had failed to grasp; his intention was to complete and repair Ptolemy's system, not to replace it completely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sabra 1998&quot;/&gt;

In the ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'' Alhazen set out his views on the difficulty of attaining scientific knowledge and the need to question existing authorities and theories:

{{quote|Truth is sought for itself [but] the truths, [he warns] are immersed in uncertainties [and the scientific authorities (such as Ptolemy, whom he greatly respected) are] not immune from error...&lt;ref name=Sabra/&gt;}}

He held that the criticism of existing theories—which dominated this book—holds a special place in the growth of scientific knowledge.

=== Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets ===

Alhazen's ''The Model of the Motions of Each of the Seven Planets'' was written {{circa}} 1038. Only one damaged manuscript has been found, with only the introduction and the first section, on the theory of planetary motion, surviving. (There was also a second section on astronomical calculation, and a third section, on astronomical instruments.) Following on from his ''Doubts on Ptolemy'', Alhazen described a new, geometry-based planetary model, describing the motions of the planets in terms of spherical geometry, infinitesimal geometry and trigonometry. He kept a geocentric universe and assumed that celestial motions are uniformly circular, which required the inclusion of [[epicycles]] to explain observed motion, but he managed to eliminate Ptolemy's [[equant]]. In general, his model made no attempt to provide a causal explanation of the motions, but concentrated on providing a complete, geometric description which could be used to explain observed motions, without the contradictions inherent in Ptolemy's model.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harv|Rashed|2007&quot;&gt;{{harv|Rashed|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other astronomical works ===

Alhazen wrote a total of twenty-five astronomical works, some concerning technical issues such as ''Exact Determination of the Meridian'', a second group concerning accurate astronomical observation, a third group concerning various astronomical problems and questions such as the location of the [[Milky Way]]; Alhazen argued for a distant location, based on the fact that it does not move in relation to the fixed stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Mohamed|2000|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth group consists of ten works on astronomical theory, including the ''Doubts'' and ''Model of the Motions'' discussed above.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rashed 2007 8–9&quot;&gt;{{harv|Rashed|2007|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mathematical works ==

In [[Islamic mathematics|mathematics]], Alhazen built on the mathematical works of [[Euclid]] and [[Thabit ibn Qurra]] and worked on &quot;the beginnings of the link between [[algebra]] and [[geometry]].&quot;&lt;ref name=Faruqi&gt;{{harv|Faruqi|2006|pp=395–6}}:
{{quote|In seventeenth century Europe the problems formulated by Ibn al-Haytham (965–1041) became known as 'Alhazen's problem'. [...] Al-Haytham’s contributions to geometry and number theory went well beyond the Archimedean tradition. Al-Haytham also worked on analytical geometry and the beginnings of the link between algebra and geometry. Subsequently, this work led in pure mathematics to the harmonious fusion of algebra and geometry that was epitomised by Descartes in geometric analysis and by Newton in the calculus. Al-Haytham was a scientist who made major contributions to the fields of mathematics, physics and astronomy during the latter half of the tenth century.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geometry ===

[[File:Lunules-better.png|thumb|The lunes of Alhazen. The two blue lunes together have the same area as the green right triangle.]]
In [[geometry]], Alhazen developed [[analytical geometry]] and the link between [[algebra]] and geometry.&lt;ref name=Faruqi/&gt; He developed a formula for adding the first 100 natural numbers, using a geometric proof to prove the formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rottman|2000}}, Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhazen explored what is now known as the [[Euclidean geometry|Euclidean]] [[parallel postulate]], the fifth [[Axiom|postulate]] in [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']], using a [[Reductio ad absurdum|proof by contradiction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Eder|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in effect introducing the concept of motion into geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Katz|1998|p=269}}: {{quote|In effect, this method characterised parallel lines as lines always equidistant from one another and also introduced the concept of motion into geometry.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He formulated the [[Lambert quadrilateral]], which Boris Abramovich Rozenfeld names the &quot;Ibn al-Haytham–Lambert quadrilateral&quot;.&lt;ref name=Rozenfeld&gt;{{harv|Rozenfeld|1988|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; His theorems on [[quadrilateral]]s, including the Lambert quadrilateral, were the first theorems on [[elliptical geometry]] and [[hyperbolic geometry]]. These theorems, along with his alternative postulates, such as Playfair's axiom, can be seen as marking the beginning of [[non-Euclidean geometry]]. His work had a considerable influence on its development among the later Persian geometers [[Omar Khayyám]] and [[Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī]], and the European geometers [[Witelo]], [[Gersonides]], and [[Abner of Burgos|Alfonso]].&lt;ref name=Rozenfeld-Youschkevitch&gt;{{harv|Rozenfeld|Youschkevitch|1996|p=470}}: {{quote|Three scientists, Ibn al-Haytham, Khayyam and al-Tusi, had made the most considerable contribution to this branch of geometry whose importance came to be completely recognized only in the nineteenth century. In essence their propositions concerning the properties of quadrangles which they considered assuming that some of the angles of these figures were acute of obtuse, embodied the first few theorems of the hyperbolic and the elliptic geometries. Their other proposals showed that various geometric statements were equivalent to the Euclidean postulate V. It is extremely important that these scholars established the mutual connection between this postulate and the sum of the angles of a triangle and a quadrangle. By their works on the theory of parallel lines Arab mathematicians directly influenced the relevant investigations of their European counterparts. The first European attempt to prove the postulate on parallel lines&amp;nbsp;– made by Witelo, the Polish scientists of the thirteenth century, while revising Alhazen's ''Book of Optics'' (''Kitab al-Manazir'') – was undoubtedly prompted by Arabic sources. The proofs put forward in the fourteenth century by the Jewish scholar Gersonides, who lived in southern France, and by the above-mentioned Alfonso from Spain directly border on Ibn Alhazen's demonstration.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In elementary geometry, Alhazen attempted to solve the problem of [[squaring the circle]] using the area of [[Lune (mathematics)|lune]]s (crescent shapes), but later gave up on the impossible task.&lt;ref name=MacTutor/&gt; The two lunes formed from a [[right triangle]] by erecting a semicircle on each of the triangle's sides, inward for the hypotenuse and outward for the other two sides, are known as the [[Lune of Hippocrates|lunes of Alhazen]]; they have the same total area as the triangle itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Charming Proofs: A Journey into Elegant Mathematics|volume=42|series=Dolciani mathematical expositions|first1=Claudi|last1=Alsina|first2=Roger B.|last2=Nelsen|publisher=Mathematical Association of America|year=2010|isbn=978-0-88385-348-1|contribution=9.1 Squarable lunes|pages=137–144|url={{google books|plainurl=yes|id=mIT5-BN_L0oC|p=137}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Number theory ===

His contributions to [[number theory]] include his work on [[perfect number]]s. In his ''Analysis and Synthesis'', Alhazen may have been the first to state that every even perfect number is of the form 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''−1&lt;/sup&gt;(2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1) where 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 is [[Prime number|prime]], but he was not able to prove this result successfully ([[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] later proved it in the 18th century).&lt;ref name=MacTutor/&gt;

Alhazen solved problems involving [[congruence relation|congruences]] using what is now called [[Wilson's theorem]]. In his ''Opuscula'', Alhazen considers the solution of a system of congruences, and gives two general methods of solution. His first method, the canonical method, involved Wilson's theorem, while his second method involved a version of the [[Chinese remainder theorem]].&lt;ref name=MacTutor/&gt;

== Other works ==

=== Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals ===

Alhazen also wrote a ''Treatise on the Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals'', although no copies have survived. It appears to have been concerned with the question of whether animals could react to music, for example whether a camel would increase or decrease its pace.

=== Engineering ===

In [[Inventions in the Islamic world|engineering]], one account of his career as a [[civil engineer]] has him summoned to Egypt by the Fatimid [[Caliph]], [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]], to regulate the [[flooding]] of the [[Nile]] River. He carried out a detailed scientific study of the annual [[inundation]] of the Nile River, and he drew plans for building a [[dam]], at the site of the modern-day [[Aswan Dam]]. His field work, however, later made him aware of the impracticality of this scheme, and he soon [[feigned madness]] so he could avoid punishment from the Caliph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Plott|2000}}, Pt. II, p. 459&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophy ===

In his ''Treatise on Place'', Alhazen disagreed with [[Aristotle]]'s view that nature abhors a [[Vacuum|void]], and he used [[geometry]] in an attempt to demonstrate that place (''al-makan'') is the imagined three-dimensional void between the inner surfaces of a containing body.&lt;ref name=Bizri-2007/&gt; [[Abd al-Latif al-Baghdadi (medieval writer)|Abd-el-latif]], a supporter of Aristotle's philosophical view of place, later criticized the work in ''Fi al-Radd ‘ala Ibn al-Haytham fi al-makan'' (''A refutation of Ibn al-Haytham’s place'') for its geometrization of place.&lt;ref name=Bizri-2007&gt;{{harv|El-Bizri|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhazen also discussed [[Depth perception|space perception]] and its [[Epistemology|epistemological]] implications in his ''[[Book of Optics]]''. In &quot;tying the visual perception of space to prior bodily experience, Alhacen unequivocally rejected the
intuitiveness of spatial perception and, therefore, the autonomy of vision. Without tangible notions of distance and size for
correlation, sight can tell us next to nothing about such things.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Smith|2005|pp=219–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theology ===

Alhazen was a devout [[Muslim]], though it is uncertain which branch of [[Islam]] he followed. He may have been either a follower of the [[Ash'ari]] school of [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Islamic theology]] according to [[Ziauddin Sardar]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Sardar 1998&quot;&gt;{{harv|Sardar|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lawrence Bettany&lt;ref name=Bettany-251/&gt; (and opposed to the views of the [[Mu'tazili]] school),&lt;ref name=Bettany-251&gt;{{harv|Bettany|1995|p=251}}&lt;/ref&gt; a follower of the Mu'tazili school of Islamic theology according to Peter Edward Hodgson,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodgson 2006 53&quot;&gt;{{harv|Hodgson|2006|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a possibly follower of [[Shia Islam]] according to [[A. I. Sabra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{harv|Sabra|1978a|p=54}} {{Request quotation|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhazen wrote a work on Islamic theology in which he discussed [[prophet]]hood and developed a system of philosophical criteria to discern its false claimants in his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Plott|2000}}, Pt. II, p. 464&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote a treatise entitled ''Finding the Direction of Qibla by Calculation'' in which he discussed finding the [[Qibla]], where [[Salat]] prayers are directed towards, mathematically.&lt;ref name=Topdemir/&gt;

He wrote in his ''Doubts Concerning Ptolemy'':

{{quote|Truth is sought for its own sake ... Finding the truth is difficult, and the road to it is rough. For the truths are plunged in obscurity. ... God, however, has not preserved the scientist from error and has not safeguarded science from shortcomings and faults. If this had been the case, scientists would not have disagreed upon any point of science...&lt;ref&gt;S. Pines (1962), ''Actes X Congrès internationale d'histoire des sciences'', Vol '''I''', Ithaca, as referenced in {{Citation|first=Shmuel (ed.)|last=Sambursky |year=1974|title= Physical Thought from the Presocratics to the Quantum Physicists|publisher=Pica Press| isbn =0-87663-712-8|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''The Winding Motion'', Alhazen further wrote:

{{quote|From the statements made by the noble [[Shaykh]], it is clear that he believes in Ptolemy's words in everything he says, without relying on a demonstration or calling on a proof, but by pure imitation (''taqlid''); that is how experts in the prophetic tradition have faith in Prophets, may the blessing of God be upon them. But it is not the way that mathematicians have faith in specialists in the demonstrative sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rashed|2007|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Alhazen described his theology:

{{quote|I constantly sought knowledge and truth, and it became my belief that for gaining access to the [[Wiktionary:effulgence|effulgence]] and closeness to God, there is no better way than that of searching for truth and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Plott|2000}}, Pt. II, p. 465&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== List of works ==

According to medieval biographers, Alhazen wrote more than 200 works on a wide range of subjects, of which at least 96 of his scientific works are known. Most of his works are now lost, but more than 50 of them have survived to some extent. Nearly half of his surviving works are on mathematics, 23 of them are on astronomy, and 14 of them are on optics, with a few on other subjects.&lt;ref name=Rashed&gt;{{harv|Rashed|2002a|p=773}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all his surviving works have yet been studied, but some of the ones that have are given below.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rashed 2007 8–9&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Topdemir&gt;{{harv|Topdemir|2007b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commemorations ==

Ibn Al-Haytham's work has been commemorated by the naming of the [[Alhazen (crater)|Alhazen crater]] on the [[moon]] after him. The asteroid [[59239 Alhazen]] was also named in his honour.

In 2014, the &quot;[[Hiding in the Light]]&quot; episode of ''[[Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey]]'', presented by [[Neil deGrasse Tyson]], focused on the accomplishments of Ibn al-Haytham. He was voiced by [[Alfred Molina]] in the episode.

[[UNESCO]] has declared 2015 the [[International Year of Light]]. Amongst others, this will be celebrating Ibn Al-Haytham's achievements in optics, mathematics and astronomy, through an international campaign titled '''1001 Inventions and the World of Ibn Al-Haytham''' featuring a series of interactive exhibits, workshops and live shows about his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/1000_years_of_arabic_optics_to_be_a_focus_of_the_international_year_of_light_in_2015 |title=1000 Years of Arabic Optics to be a Focus of the International Year of Light in 2015 |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=27 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
UNESCO's website &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.light2015.org/Home/ScienceStories/1000-Years-of-Arabic-Optics.html |title=1000 Years of Arabic Optics}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Ibn al-Haytham copies a part from [[Jim Al-Khalili]]'s popular history ''Pathfinders: The Golden Age of Arabic Science''.
