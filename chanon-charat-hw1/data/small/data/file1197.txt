'''''Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri''''' is a [[video game]] in the [[4X]] genre and set in a [[science fiction]] background which is considered a [[spiritual sequel]] to the [[Civilization (series)|''Civilization'' series]]. Set in the [[2100s (decade)#Fictional events|22nd century]], the game begins as seven competing ideological factions land on the planet Chiron (&quot;Planet&quot;) in the [[Alpha Centauri]] [[star system]]. As the game progresses, Planet's growing sentience becomes a formidable obstacle to the human colonists.

[[Sid Meier]], designer of ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'', and [[Brian Reynolds (game designer)|Brian Reynolds]], designer of ''[[Civilization II]]'', developed ''Alpha Centauri'' after they left [[MicroProse]] to join the newly created [[Video game developer|developer]] [[Firaxis Games]]. [[Electronic Arts]] released both ''Alpha Centauri'' and its expansion, ''Sid Meier's Alien Crossfire'', in 1999. In the following year, [[Aspyr Media]] and [[Loki Software]] [[Porting|ported]] both titles over to [[Mac OS]] and [[Linux]].

''Alpha Centauri'' features improvements on ''Civilization II''{{'}}s [[game engine]], including simultaneous multiplay, social engineering, climate, customizable units, alien native life, additional diplomatic and spy options, additional ways to win, and greater [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]]-ability. ''Alien Crossfire'' introduces five new human and two non-human factions, as well as additional technologies, facilities, secret projects, native life, unit abilities, and a victory condition.

The game received wide critical acclaim, being compared favorably to ''Civilization II''. Critics praised its science fiction storyline (comparing the plot to works by [[Stanley Kubrick]], [[Frank Herbert]], [[Arthur C. Clarke]], and [[Isaac Asimov]]), the in-game writing, the voice acting, the user-created custom units, and the depth of the [[technology tree]]. ''Alpha Centauri'' also won several awards for best game of the year and best strategy game of the year. Despite the good reception, the game had the lowest sales of the ''Civilization'' series.

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
Space-race victories in the ''Civilization'' series conclude with a journey to [[Alpha Centauri]].&lt;ref name=Shah2000p1&gt;[[#Shah2000|Shah (2000)]], p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with that premise the ''Alpha Centauri'' narrative starts in the [[22nd century#Video games|22nd century]], after the [[United Nations]] sends &quot;Unity&quot;, a colonization mission, to Alpha Centauri's planet Chiron (&quot;Planet&quot;).&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p2&gt;[[#SMACManual|Reynolds (1999)]], p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Unbeknownst to humans, advanced extraterrestrials (&quot;Progenitors&quot;) had been conducting experiments in vast distributed nervous systems, culminating in planetary biosphere-sized presentient nervous system (&quot;Manifold&quot;) on Chiron, leaving behind monoliths and artifacts on Planet to guide and examine the system's growth.&lt;ref name=Shah2000p3&gt;[[#Shah2000|Shah (2000)]], p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately prior to the start of the game, a reactor malfunction on the Unity spacecraft wakes the crew and colonists early and irreparably severs communications with Earth.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p3&gt;[[#SMACManual|Reynolds (1999)]], p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; After the captain is assassinated, the most powerful leaders on board build ideological factions with dedicated followers, conflicting agendas for the future of mankind, and &quot;desperately serious&quot; commitments.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMACManual1999p3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rosen1999&gt;[[#Rosen1999|Rosen (1999)]]&lt;/ref&gt; As the ship breaks up, seven escape pods, each containing a faction, are scattered across Planet.&lt;ref name=Tito2005p1&gt;[[#Tito2005|Tito (2005)]], p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Alien Crossfire'' expansion pack, it is learned that earlier alien experiments had led to disastrous consequences at [[Tau Ceti]], creating a hundred-million-year evolutionary cycle that ended with the eradication of most complex animal life in several neighbouring inhabited star systems.&lt;ref name=Primap286&gt;[[#Prima|McCubbin (1999)]], p.286.&lt;/ref&gt; After the disaster (referred to by Progenitors as &quot;Tau Ceti Flowering&quot;), the Progenitors split into two factions: Manifold Caretakers, opposed to further experimentation and dedicated to preventing another Flowering; and Manifold Usurpers, favoring further experimentation and intending to induce a controlled Flowering in ''Alpha Centauri''{{'}}s Planet. In ''Alien Crossfire'', these factions compete along with the human factions for control over the destiny of Planet.

===Characters===
The game focuses on the leaders of seven factions, chosen by the player from the 14 possible leaders in ''Alpha Centauri'' and ''Alien Crossfire'', and Planet (voiced by Alena Kanka).&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p246&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1999)]], p.246.&lt;/ref&gt; The characters are developed from the faction leaders' portraits, the spoken monologues accompanying scientific discoveries and the &quot;photographs in the corner of a commlink – home towns, first steps, first loves, family, graduation, spacewalk.&quot;&lt;ref name=Edge2006p1&gt;[[#Edge2006|Edge Staff (2006)]], p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders in ''Alpha Centauri'' comprise: Lady Deirdre Skye, a Scottish activist (voiced by Carolyn Dahl), of ''Gaia's Stepdaughters'', Chairman Sheng-Ji Yang, a Chinese official  (voiced by Lu Yu), of the ''Human Hive'', Academician Prokhor Zakharov, a Russian academic (voice by Yuri Nesteroff) of the ''University of Planet'', CEO Nwabudike Morgan, a Namibian businessman (voiced by Regi Davis), of ''Morgan Industries'', Colonel Corazon Santiago, a Puerto Rican militiawoman (voiced by Wanda Niño), of the ''Spartan Federation'', Sister Miriam Godwinson, an American minister and social psychologist (voiced by Gretchen Weigel), of the ''Lord's Believers'', and Commissioner Pravin Lal, an Indian surgeon and diplomat (voiced by Hesh Gordon), of the ''Peacekeeping Forces''.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p246/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999pp11-13&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1999)]], pp.11–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The seven additional faction leaders in ''Alien Crossfire'' are Prime Function Aki Zeta-Five, a Norwegian research assistant-turned-cyborg (voiced by Allie Rivenbark), of ''The Cybernetic Consciousness'', Captain Ulrik Svensgaard, an American fisherman and naval officer (voiced by James Liebman), of ''The Nautilus Pirates'', Foreman Domai, an Australian labor leader (voiced by Frederick Serafin), of ''The Free Drones'', Datajack Sinder Roze, a Trinidadian hacker (voiced by Christine Melton), of ''The Data Angels'', Prophet Cha Dawn, a human born on Planet (voiced by Stacy Spenser) of ''The Cult of Planet'', Guardian Lular H'minee, a Progenitor leader (voiced by Jeff Gordon) of ''The Manifold Caretakers'', and Conqueror Judaa Maar, a Progenitor leader (voiced by Jeff Gordon) of ''The Manifold Usurpers''.&lt;ref name=Shah2000p2/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999pp11-13&gt;[[#SMAXManual1999|Train (1999)]], pp.11–13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p49&gt;[[#SMAXManual1999|Train (1999)]], p49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The player controls one of the leaders and competes against the others to colonize and conquer Planet.&lt;ref name=Rosen1999/&gt; The Datalinks (voiced by Robert Levy and Katherine Ferguson) are minor characters who provide information to the player.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p246/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p111&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1999)]], p.111.&lt;/ref&gt; Each faction excels at one or two important aspects of the game and follows a distinct philosophical belief, such as [[technological utopianism]], [[environmentalism]], [[capitalism]], [[militarism]], [[anti-authoritarianism]], [[piracy]], [[classic liberalism]], or the [[Gaia philosophy]].&lt;ref name=Shah2000p2/&gt;&lt;ref name=DD898p2&gt;[[#DD|Train (1998-08-11)]], p2.&lt;/ref&gt; The game takes place on the last &quot;character&quot;, Planet, with its &quot;rolling red ochre plains&quot;, and &quot;bands of lonely terraformed green&quot;.&lt;ref name=Edge2006p2&gt;[[#Edge2006|Edge Staff (2006)]], p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plot===
The story unfolds via the introduction video, explanations of new technologies, videos obtained for completing secret projects, interludes, and cut-scenes.&lt;ref name=Shah2000p1/&gt; The native life consists primarily of simple wormlike alien parasites and a type of red fungus that spreads rapidly via spores.&lt;ref name=Shah2000p2&gt;[[#Shah2000|Shah (2000)]], p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; The fungus is difficult to traverse, provides invisibility for the enemy, provides few resources, and spawns &quot;mindworms&quot; that attack population centres and military units by neurally parasitising them.&lt;ref name=Tito2005p2&gt;[[#Tito2005|Tito (2005)]], p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Mindworms can eventually be captured and bred in captivity and used as terroristic bioweapons,&lt;ref name=Primap277&gt;[[#Prima|McCubbin (1999)]], p.277.&lt;/ref&gt; and the player eventually discovers that the fungus and mindworms can [[Group mind (science fiction)|think collectively]].&lt;ref name=Primap277/&gt; Soon the player dreams of a voice.&lt;ref name=Primap278&gt;[[#Prima|McCubbin (1999)]], p.278.&lt;/ref&gt; This voice later intrudes into waking moments, threatening more attacks if the industrial pollution and terraforming by the colonists is not reversed.&lt;ref name=Tito2005p2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Primap281&gt;[[#Prima|McCubbin (1999)]], p.281.&lt;/ref&gt; The player discovers that Planet is a dormant semi-[[Sentience|sentient]] hive organism that will soon experience a metamorphosis which will destroy all human life.&lt;ref name=Shah2000p4/&gt;&lt;ref name=Primap282&gt;[[#Prima|McCubbin (1999)]], p.282.&lt;/ref&gt; To counter this threat, the player or a computer faction builds &quot;The Voice of Alpha Centauri&quot; secret project, which artificially links Planet's distributed nervous system into the human Datalinks, delaying Planet's metamorphosis into full self-awareness but incidentally increasing its ultimate intelligence substantially by giving it access to all of humanity's accumulated knowledge.&lt;ref name=Primap283&gt;[[#Prima|McCubbin (1999)]], p.283.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Primap284&gt;[[#Prima|McCubbin (1999)]], p.284.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Primap285&gt;[[#Prima|McCubbin (1999)]], p.285.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the player or a computer faction embraces the &quot;Ascent to Transcendence&quot; in which humans too join their brains with the hive organism in its metamorphosis to &quot;godhood&quot;.&lt;ref name=Primap287&gt;[[#Prima|McCubbin (1999)]], p.287.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''Alpha Centauri'' closes &quot;with a swell of hope and wonder in place of the expected triumphalism&quot;, reassuring &quot;that the events of the game weren’t the entirety of mankind’s future, but just another step.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Edge2006p2&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--  As time passes, Chiron begins to awake and intrude on the player's dreams, eventually giving a player the chance to &quot;transcend&quot; or join &quot;Planet&quot; through technological research and the construction of the massive project, &quot;The Ascent to Transcendence&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;book&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Journey to Centauri|first=Mike|last=Ely|work=Firaxis Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

''Alpha Centauri'', a [[turn-based strategy]] game with a science fiction setting, is played from a third-person, [[Isometric graphics in video games|isometric]] perspective. Many game features from ''[[Civilization II]]'' are present, but renamed or slightly tweaked: players establish bases (Civilization II's cities), build facilities (buildings) and secret projects (Wonders of the World), explore territory, research technology, and conquer other factions (civilizations).&lt;ref name=&quot;Shah2000p1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tito2005p1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Noer |first=Michael |url=http://www.forbes.com/1997/07/25/sid.html |title=Sid starts up.

The main map (the upper two thirds of the screen) is divided into squares, on which players can establish bases, move units and engage in combat. Through [[Terraforming in popular culture|terraforming]], players may modify the effects of the individual map squares on movement, combat and resources. Resources are used to feed the population, construct units and facilities, and supply energy. Players can allocate energy between research into new technology and energy reserves. Unlike ''Civilization II'', new technology grants access to additional unit components rather than pre-designed units, allowing players to design and re-design units as their factions' priorities shift.&lt;ref name=Edge2006p1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Primap230&gt;[[#Prima|McCubbin (1999)]], p.230.&lt;/ref&gt; Energy reserves allow the player to upgrade units, maintain facilities, and attempt to win by the Global Energy Market scenario. Bases are military strongpoints and objectives that are vital for all winning strategies. They produce military units, house the population, collect energy, and build secret projects and Subspace Generators. Facilities and secret projects improve the performance of individual bases and of the entire faction.

In addition to terraforming, optimizing individual base performance and building secret projects, players may also benefit their factions through social engineering, probe teams, and diplomacy. Social engineering modifies the ideologically based bonuses and penalties forced by the player's choice of faction.&lt;ref name=Tito2005p1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Edge2006p1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Shah2000p2/&gt;&lt;ref name=DD898p2/&gt;&lt;ref name=DD898p1&gt;[[#DD|Train (1998-08-11)]], p1.&lt;/ref&gt; Probe teams can sabotage and steal information, units, technology, and energy from enemy bases, while diplomacy lets the player create coalitions with other factions. It also allows the trade or transfer of units, bases, technology and energy. The Planetary Council, similar to the [[United Nations Security Council]], takes Planet-wide actions and determines population victories.&lt;ref&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1999)]], p.132.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to futuristic technological advances and secret projects, the game includes alien life, structures and machines.&lt;ref name=Shah2000p1/&gt; &quot;Xenofungus&quot; and &quot;sea fungus&quot; provide movement, combat, and resource penalties, as well as concealment for &quot;mind worms&quot; and &quot;spore launchers.&quot;&lt;ref name=Shah2000p4/&gt; Immobile &quot;fungal towers&quot; spawn native life. Native life, including the seaborne &quot;Isles of the Deep&quot; and &quot;Sealurks&quot; and airborne &quot;Locusts of Chiron&quot;, use [[psionic]] combat, an alternate form of combat which ignores weapons and armor.&lt;ref name=Shah2000p4&gt;[[#Shah2000|Shah (2000)]], p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monolith]]s repair units and provide resources; [[Artefact (archaeology)|artifacts]] yield new technology and hasten secret projects; [[landmarks]] provide resource bonuses; and random events add danger and opportunity. Excessive development leads to terraforming-destroying fungus blooms and new native life.

''Alpha Centauri'' provides a single player mode and supports [[Modding|customization]] and [[multiplayer]]. Players may customize the game by choosing options at the beginning of the game, using the built-in scenario and map editors, and modifying ''Alpha Centauri''{{'}}s game files. In addition to a choice of seven (or 14 in ''Alien Crossfire'') factions, pre-game options include scenario game, customized random map, difficulty level, and game rules that include victory conditions, research control, and initial map knowledge. The scenario and map editors allow players to create customized scenarios and maps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civgaming.net/smac/acad_scened.shtml &quot;The Scenario Editor&quot;], Civilization Gaming Networks.&lt;/ref&gt; The game's basic rules, diplomatic dialog, and the factions' starting abilities are in text files, which &quot;the designers have done their best to make it reasonably easy to modify..., even for non-programmers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1999)]], p.207.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civgaming.net/smac/alphaxguide_v1_3.html &quot;Alpha(x).txt editing (v. 1.3)&quot;], Civilization Gaming Networks.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alpha Centauri'' supports play by email (&quot;PBEM&quot;) and TCP/IP mode featuring simultaneous movement, and introduces direct player-to-player negotiation, allowing the unconstrained trade of technology, energy, maps, and other elements.&lt;ref name=DD1298p2&gt;[[#DD|Reynolds (1998-12-09)]], p2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development history==

===Inspirations===
In 1996, [[MicroProse]] released the lauded ''Civilization II'', designed by [[Brian Reynolds (game designer)|Brian Reynolds]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/pc/civilization2?q=civilization |title=Civilization II (pc) reviews at |publisher=Metacritic.com |date=1996-02-29 |accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the firm's management had changed and moved to California by the time the game shipped,&lt;ref name=Harrison2000&gt;[[#Harrison2000|Harrison (2000)]].&lt;/ref&gt; and disagreements between the new management and its employees prompted Reynolds, [[Jeff Briggs]], and [[Sid Meier]] (designer of the original ''[[Civilization (video game)|Civilization]]'') to leave MicroProse and found [[Firaxis]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/1523/the_history_of_civilization.php?print=1 |title=Features – The History of Civilization |publisher=Gamasutra |date= |accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/company/microprose-software-inc/history |title=History for MicroProse Software, Inc |publisher=Mobygames.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although unable to use the same [[intellectual property|IP]] as ''Civilization II'', the new company felt that players wanted &quot;a new sweeping epic of a turn-based game&quot;. Having just completed a game of human history up to the present, they wanted a fresh topic and chose science fiction.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p237&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1998-11-23)]], p.237.&lt;/ref&gt; With no previous experience in science fiction games, the developers believed [[future history]] was a fitting first foray.&lt;ref name=DD698p1&gt;[[#DD|Reynolds (1998-06-04)]], p1.&lt;/ref&gt; For the elements of exploring and terraforming an alien world, they chose a plausible near future situation of a human mission to colonize the solar system's nearest neighbor and human factions.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p238&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1998-11-23)]], pp.238.&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds researched science fiction for the game's writing.&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt; His inspiration included&lt;!-- not sure if this wording is still within what the source says: source says &quot;inspiration&quot;--&gt; &quot;classic works of science fiction&quot;, including [[Frank Herbert]]'s ''[[The Jesus Incident]]'', ''[[A Fire Upon the Deep]]'' by [[Vernor Vinge]], and ''[[The Mote in God's Eye]]'' by [[Larry Niven]] and [[Jerry Pournelle]] for alien races; [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s ''[[Red Mars]]'', ''Slant'' by [[Greg Bear]], and [[Stephen R. Donaldson]]'s ''[[The Real Story]]'' for future technology and science; and ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'' by Herbert and Bear's ''[[Anvil of Stars]]'' for negative interactions between humans.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p228&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (February, 1999)]], p.228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p229&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (February, 1999)]], pp.229.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Alpha Centauri'' set out to capture the whole sweep of humanity's future, including technology, futuristic warfare, social and economic development, the future of the human condition, spirituality, and philosophy.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p237/&gt; Reynolds also said that &quot;getting philosophy into the game&quot; was one of the attractions of the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harrison2000&quot;/&gt; Believing good science fiction thrives on constraint, the developers began with near-future technologies. As they proceeded into the future, they tried to present a coherent, logical, and detailed picture of future developments in physics, biology, information technology, economics, society, government, and philosophy.&lt;ref name=DD698p1/&gt; Alien ecologies and mysterious intelligences were incorporated into ''Alpha Centauri'' as external &quot;natural forces&quot; intended to serve as flywheels for the backstory and a catalyst for many player intelligences.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p238/&gt; Chris Pine, creator of the in-game map of Planet, strove to make Planet look like a real planet, which resulted in evidence of tectonic action. Another concern was that Planet matched the story, which resulted in the fungus being connected across continents, as it is supposed to be a gigantic neural network.&lt;ref name=Prima70&gt;[[#Prima|Pine (1999)]], p.70.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terraforming]] is a natural outgrowth of colonizing an alien world.&lt;ref name=DD698p2&gt;[[#DD|Reynolds (1998-06-04)]], p2.&lt;/ref&gt; The first playable prototype was just a map generator that tested climate changes during the game.&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt; This required the designers to create a world builder program and climatic model far more powerful than anything they'd done before. Temperature, wind, and rainfall patterns were modeled in ways that allow players to make changes: for example, creating a ridge-line and then watching the effects. In addition to raising terrain, the player can also divert rivers, dig huge boreholes into the planet's mantle, and melt ice caps.&lt;ref name=DD698p2/&gt;

In addition to scientific advances, the designers speculated on the future development of human society.&lt;ref name=DD698p3&gt;[[#DD|Reynolds (1998-06-04)]], p3.&lt;/ref&gt; The designers allow the player to decide on a whole series of value choices and choose a &quot;ruthless,&quot; &quot;moderate,&quot; or &quot;idealistic&quot; stance.&lt;!-- list seems excess here. , i.e. &quot;economics, liberties, religion, health care, military service, education, environment, and information,&quot;--&gt;&lt;!--I think we can just say a series of value choices, but I like the &quot;ruthless,&quot; &quot;moderate&quot; and &quot;idealistic&quot;--&gt; Reynolds said the designers don't promote a single &quot;right&quot; answer, instead giving each value choice positive and negative consequences. This design was intended to force the player to &quot;think&quot; and make the game &quot;addictive.&quot;&lt;ref name=DD698p3/&gt; He also commented that ''Alpha Centauri''{{'}}s fictional nature allowed them to draw their characters &quot;a lot more sharply and distinctly than the natural blurring and greyness of history.&quot;&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt;
&lt;!--[[Chiron]], the name of the planet, is the name of the only non-barbaric [[centaur]] in Greek mythology and an important loregiver and teacher for humanity. The name also pays homage to [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan's]] 1982 [[space opera]] novel ''[[Voyage from Yesteryear]]'', in which a human colony is artificially planted by an automatic probe on a planet later named by colonists as Chiron. In the game, Chiron has two moons, named after the centaurs [[Nessus (mythology)|Nessus]] and [[Pholus (mythology)|Pholus]], with the combined tidal force of [[Moon|Earth's Moon]], and is the second planet out from Alpha Centauri A, the innermost planet being the [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]-like planet named after the centaur [[Eurytion]]. Alpha Centauri B is also dubbed [[Hercules]], a reference to him killing several centaurs in mythology, and the second star preventing the formation of larger planets. The arrival on Chiron is referred to as &quot;Planetfall&quot;, which is a term used in many science fiction novels, including [[Robert A.

===''Alpha Centauri''===
In July 1996, Firaxis began work on ''Alpha Centauri'',&lt;ref name = &quot;B&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri|url=http://www.firaxis.com/games/game_detail.php?gameid=7|work=Firaxis Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p236&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1998-11-23)]], p.236.&lt;/ref&gt; with Reynolds heading the project.&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt; Meier and Reynolds wrote playable prototype code and Jason Coleman wrote the first lines of the development [[Library (computing)|libraries]].&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p236/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://pc.ign.com/articles/075/075802p1.html| title = Brian Reynolds Launches New Development Studio| publisher = IGN| date = 2000-02-28| accessdate = 2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the development of ''Gettysburg'' took up most of Firaxis' time, the designers spent the first year prototyping the basic ideas.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p238/&gt; By late 1996, the developers were playing games on the prototype, and by the middle of the next year, they were working on a multiplayer [[Game engine|engine]].&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p238/&gt; Reynolds' previous games omitted internet support because he believed that complex turn-based games with many player options and opportunities for player input are difficult to facilitate online.&lt;ref name=DD1298p1&gt;[[#DD|Reynolds (1998-12-09)]], p1.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Firaxis intended to include multiplayer support in its games, an important goal was to create games with depth and longevity in single-player mode because they believed that the majority of players spend most of their time playing this way. Reynolds felt that smart computer opponents are an integral part of a classic computer game, and considered it a challenge to make them so.&lt;ref name=DD498p1&gt;[[#DD|Reynolds (1998-04-14)]], p1.&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that the most important principle of game design is for the designer to play the game as it is developed;&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt; Reynolds claimed that this was how a good [[Game artificial intelligence|artificial intelligence]] (AI) was built. To this end, he would track the decisions he made and why he made them as he played the game.&lt;ref name=DD498p1/&gt; The designer also watched what the computer players did, noting &quot;dumb&quot; actions and trying to discover why the computer made them.&lt;ref name=DD498p1/&gt;&lt;ref name=DD498p2&gt;[[#DD|Reynolds (1998-04-14)]], p2.&lt;/ref&gt; Reynolds then taught the computer his reasoning process so the AI could find the right choice when presented several attractive possibilities.&lt;ref name=DD498p1/&gt;&lt;ref name=DD498p2/&gt; He said the AI for diplomatic personalities was the best he had done up to that point.&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt;

Doug Kaufman, a co-designer of ''Civilization II'', was invited to join development as a game balancer.&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p238/&gt; Reynolds cited the ''Alpha Centauri''{{'}}s balance for the greater sense of urgency and the more pressing pacing than in his earlier game, ''[[Sid Meier's Colonization]]''.&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt; According to producer Timothy Train, in designing the strengths and weaknesses of the factions, the goal was to suggest, without requiring, certain strategies and give the player interesting and fun things to do without unbalancing the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;DD898p1&quot;/&gt; He didn't want a faction to be dependent on its strength or a faction's power to be dominant over the rest.&lt;ref name=DD898p2/&gt; Train felt that fun meant the factions always have something fun to do with their attributes.&lt;ref name=DD898p3&gt;[[#DD|Train (1998-08-11)]], p3.&lt;/ref&gt; Around the summer of 1997&lt;!-- what time? a date to anchor this would be good--&gt;, the staff began research on the scientific realities involved in interstellar travel.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p238/&gt; In late 1997, [[Bing Gordon]]—then Chief Creative Officer of [[Electronic Arts]]—joined the team, and was responsible for the Planetary Council, extensive diplomacy, and landmarks.&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p239&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1998-11-23)]], p.239.&lt;/ref&gt; A few months before the 1998 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3), the team incorporated the Explore/Discover/Build/Conquer marketing campaign into the game.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p239/&gt; The game was announced in May 1998 at E3.&lt;!--According to your guidelines, when and where was the game first announced?--&gt;

In the latter half of 1998, the team produced a polished and integrated interface, wrote the game manual and foreign language translations, painted the faction leader portraits and terrain, built the [[3D computer graphics|3D]] vehicles and vehicle parts, and created the music.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p240-1&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1998-11-23)]], pp.240–1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Ely]] directed the Secret Project movies and cast the faction leaders.&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p241&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1998-11-23)]], p.241.&lt;/ref&gt; 25 volunteers participated in Firaxis' first public [[Software release life cycle|beta test]].&lt;ref name=SMACManual1999p242&gt;[[#SMACManual1999|Reynolds (1998-11-23)]], p.242.&lt;/ref&gt; The beta testers suggested the Diplomatic and Economic victories and the Random Events.&lt;!-- How are they responsible?

The design team started with a very simple playable game.&lt;ref name=DD399p1/&gt; They strengthen the &quot;fun&quot; aspects and fixed or removed the unenjoyable ones, a process Sid Meier called &quot;surrounding the fun.&quot;&lt;ref name=DD399p1/&gt; After the revision, they played it again, repeating the cycle of revision and play.&lt;ref name=DD399p1/&gt; Playing the game repeatedly and in-depth was a rule at Firaxis.&lt;ref name=DD898p3/&gt; In the single-player mode, the team tried extreme strategies to find any sure-fire paths to victory and to see how often a particular computer faction ends up at the bottom.&lt;ref name=DD898p3/&gt; The goal was a product of unprecedented depth, scope, longevity, and addictiveness, where the player is always challenged by the game to come up with new strategies with no all-powerful factions or unstoppable tactics.&lt;ref name=DD898p3/&gt; According to Reynolds, the process has been around since Sid Meier's early days at Microprose.&lt;ref name=DD399p1/&gt; At Firaxis, as iterations continue, they expand the group giving feedback, bringing in outside gamers with fresh perspectives.&lt;ref name=DD399p2&gt;[[#DD|Reynolds (1999-03-15)]], p2.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alpha Centauri'' was the first Firaxis game with public beta testers.&lt;ref name=DD399p2/&gt;

Finally, Brian Reynolds discussed the use of the demo in the development process.&lt;ref name=DD399p2/&gt; Originally a marketing tool released prior to the game, they started getting feedback.&lt;ref name=DD399p3&gt;[[#DD|Reynolds (1999-03-15)]], p3.&lt;/ref&gt; They were able to incorporate many suggestions into the retail version.&lt;ref name=DD399p3/&gt; According to Brian Reynolds, they made improvement in the game's interface, added a couple of new features and fixed a few glitches.&lt;ref name=DD399p3/&gt; They also improved some rules, fine-tuned the game balance and improved the AI.&lt;ref name=DD399p3/&gt; Finally, he adds that they continued to add patches to enhance the game after the game was released.&lt;ref name=DD399p3/&gt;
&lt;!--Reynolds also said that the diplomatic personality was the best he has ever done up to that point, that the system of boundaries (introduced in ''Alpha Centauri'') worked really well without adding micromanagement, that he would have liked to have expanded the cutscenes, and that the biggest frustration was getting the 3d &quot;Voxel&quot; code to draw units.&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt;--&gt;In the months leading to the release of ''Alpha Centauri'', multimedia producer [[Michael Ely]] wrote the 35 weekly episodes of ''Journey to Centauri'' detailing the splintering of the U.N. mission to Alpha Centauri.&lt;ref name=OfficialSiteStory&gt;[[#OfficialSite|Official Site: The Story]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Alien Crossfire''===
A month after ''Alpha Centauri''{{'}}s February 1999 release, the Firaxis team began work on the expansion pack, ''Sid Meier's Alien Crossfire''.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.ign.com/objects/009/009941.html |title=IGN: Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri |publisher=IGN |date= |accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p45&gt;[[#SMAXManual1999|Train (1999-08-25)]], p.45.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alien Crossfire'' features seven new factions (two that are non-human), new technologies, new facilities, new secret projects, new alien life forms, new unit special abilities, new victory conditions (including the new &quot;Progenitor Victory&quot;)&lt;!-- is this victory more important than the other new victories? --&gt;&lt;!--the Progenitor Victory was totally new; other victory conditions were modified to take the aliens into account--&gt; and several additional concepts and strategies.&lt;ref name = &quot;B&quot;/&gt; The development team included Train as producer and designer, Chris Pine as programmer, Jerome Atherholt and Greg Foertsch as artists, and Doug Kaufman as co-designer and game balancer.&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p46/&gt; The team considered several ideas, including a return to a post-apocalyptic earth and the conquest of another planet in the Alpha Centauri system, before deciding to keep the new title on Planet. The premise allowed them to mix and match old and new characters and delve into the mysteries of the monoliths and alien artifacts.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p45/&gt; The backstory evolved quickly, and the main conflict centered on the return of the original alien inhabitants.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p46&gt;[[#SMAXManual1999|Train (1999-08-25)]], p.46.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of humans inadvertently caught up in an off-world civil war focused the story.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p46/&gt;

Train wanted to improve the &quot;build&quot; aspects, feeling that the god-game genre had always been heavily slanted towards the &quot;Conquer&quot; end of the spectrum.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p46/&gt; He wanted to provide &quot;builders&quot; with the tools to construct an empire in the face of heated competition.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p46/&gt; The internet community provided &quot;invaluable&quot; feedback.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p46/&gt; The first &quot;call for features&quot; was posted around April 1999 and produced the Fletchette Defense System, Algorithmic Enhancement, and The Nethack Terminus.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p46/&gt; The team had several goals: factions should not be &quot;locked-in&quot; to certain strategies; players should have interesting things to do without unbalancing the game, and the factions must be fun to play.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p47-8&gt;[[#SMAXManual1999|Train (1999-08-25)]], pp.47–8.&lt;/ref&gt; The team believed the &quot;coolness&quot; of the Progenitor aliens would determine the success or failure of ''Alien Crossfire''.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p47&gt;[[#SMAXManual1999|Train (1999-08-25)]], p.47.&lt;/ref&gt; They strove to make them feel significantly different to play, but still compatible with the existing game mechanics.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p47/&gt; The developers eventually provided the aliens with Battle Ogres, a Planetary survey, non-blind research, and other powers to produce &quot;a nasty and potent race that would take the combined might of humanity to bring them down.&quot;&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p47/&gt; Chris Pine modified&lt;!-- is &quot;added&quot; the proper term here? --&gt; the AI to account for the additions.&lt;ref name=Harrison2000/&gt; The team also used artwork, sound effects, music, and diplomatic text to set the aliens apart.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p47/&gt; Other than the aliens, the Pirates proved to be the toughest faction to balance because their ocean start gave them huge advantages.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p48&gt;[[#SMAXManual1999|Train (1999-08-25)]], p.48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon completion, the team felt that ''Alien Crossfire'' was somewhere between an expansion and a full-blown sequel.&lt;ref name=SMAXManual1999p48/&gt; In the months leading to the release of ''Alien Crossfire'', multimedia producer [[Michael Ely]] wrote the 9&amp;nbsp;episodes of ''Centauri: Arrival'', introducing the ''Alien Crossfire'' factions.&lt;ref name=&quot;OfficialSiteStory&quot;/&gt; The game initially had a single production run. [[Electronic Arts]] bundled ''Alpha Centauri'' and ''Alien Crossfire'' in the ''Alpha Centauri Planetary Pack'' in 2000 and included both games in ''The Laptop Collection'' in 2003.&lt;ref name = &quot;C&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri Planetary Pack|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/sid-meiers-alpha-centauri-planetary-pack|work=Moby Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Laptop Collection|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/windows/laptop-collection|work=Moby Games}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, both ''Alpha Centauri'' and ''Alien Crossfire'' were ported to [[Mac OS]] by [[Aspyr Media]] and to [[Linux]] by [[Loki Software]].&lt;ref name=Shah2000p1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidemacgames.com/reviews/view.php?ID=43 |title=Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri |publisher=Insidemacgames.com |date=2000-06-09 |accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shah |first=Rawn |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/08/24/linux.civ.review.idg/index.html |title=Review: Alpha Centauri for Linux |publisher=Archives.cnn.com |date=2000-08-24 |accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- The game can fail to run on some default configurations of modern Linux distributions created after 2004, although there are workarounds available that address this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lordhedgehog.hedgie.com/smac/ |title=Running Alpha Centauri in Linux |publisher=Lordhedgehog.hedgie.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alan Swanson |url=http://www.swanson.ukfsn.org/loki/ |title=Libraries for running old Loki games |publisher=Swanson.ukfsn.org |date=2009-10-03 |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Loki installers for linux gamers]] supplies an installer that allows the game to run on modern systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liflg.org/?catid=7&amp;gameid=90 |title=Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri Beta Linux Installer from |publisher=LIFLG |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;!-- This last part about Linux problems comes across as a how-to-guide Is it necessary and are the source reliable? --&gt;&lt;!--This is a vestige from the article prior to this summer.

''Alpha Centauri's'' turn-based gameplay, including the technology trees and factional warfare, was commonly compared to ''Civilization'' and ''Civilization II''. The Adrenaline Vault's Pete Hines said, &quot;While ''Alpha Centauri'' is the evolutionary off-spring to [''Civilization''] and [''Civilization II''], it is not [''Civilization II''] in space. Although the comparison is inevitable because of the lineage, it is still short-sighted.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;avaultreview&quot; /&gt; ''Edge'' in 2006 praised &quot;Alpha Centauri’s greater sophistications as a strategy game.&quot;&lt;ref name=Edge2006p1/&gt; IGN said &quot;Alpha Centauri is a better game than Civilization II; it's deep, rich, rewarding, thought-provoking in almost every way.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ignreview&quot; /&gt; Game Revolution's reviewer was less magnanimous, saying &quot;Alpha Centauri is at least as good a game as Civilization 2. But it is its great similarity that also does it the most detriment. Alpha Centauri simply does not do enough that is new; it just doesn't innovate enough to earn a higher grade.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;grevreview&quot; /&gt; The ability to create custom units was praised,&lt;ref name=&quot;fsquadreview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;avaultreview&quot; /&gt; as was the depth of the tech tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;avaultreview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;grevreview&quot; /&gt; The artificial intelligence of computer-controlled factions, which featured adaptability and behavioral subtlety,&lt;ref name=&quot;redefining&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | last = Scheisel | first = Seth | authorlink = | title = Redefining the Power of the Gamer | work = The New York Times | publisher = | date = June 7, 2005 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/07/arts/07arti.html | accessdate = November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was given mixed comments; some reviewers thought it was efficient and logical,&lt;ref name=&quot;ignreview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gproreview&quot; /&gt; while others found it confusing or erratic.&lt;ref name=&quot;avaultreview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;grevreview&quot; /&gt; ''Edge'' was disappointed in the game's diplomacy, finding &quot;no more and no less than is expected from the genre&quot; and unhappy with &quot;the inability to sound out any real sense of relationship or rational discourse.&quot;&lt;ref name=Edge2006p2/&gt;

{{Rquote|left|If you're looking for gratuitous eye candy, then you're obviously in the wrong place. Alpha Centauri's graphics are quite good, but they're not going to make anyone sit up and take notice.|Bob Colayco|FiringSquad&lt;ref name=&quot;fsquadreview&quot; /&gt;}}

The game's graphics were widely acknowledged to be above average at the time of its release, but not revolutionary.&lt;ref name=&quot;ignreview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fsquadreview&quot; /&gt; Its maps and interface were
considered detailed and in accordance with a space theme,&lt;ref name=&quot;fsquadreview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;grevreview&quot; /&gt; but the game was released with a limited color palette.&lt;ref name=&quot;avaultreview&quot; /&gt; The in-game cutscenes, particularly the [[full motion video]] that accompanied technological advances, were praised for their quality and innovation.&lt;ref name=&quot;fsquadreview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;avaultreview&quot; /&gt; ''Alpha Centauri's'' sound and music received similar comments;&lt;ref name=&quot;ignreview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;avaultreview&quot; /&gt; FiringSquad said &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[The sound effect quality]&lt;/nowiki&gt; sort of follows the same line as the unit graphics – not too splashy but enough to get the job done.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;fsquadreview&quot; /&gt;

''Alpha Centauri'' has won several Game of the Year awards,&lt;ref name=Tito2005p2/&gt; including those from the ''[[The Denver Post|Denver Post]]'' and the ''[[Toronto Sun]]''. It won the &quot;Turn-based Strategy Game of the Year&quot; award from [[GameSpot]] as well. The [[Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences]] named ''Alpha Centauri'' the best strategy game of the year, and in 2000, ''Alpha Centauri'' won the [[Origins Award]] for ''Best Strategy Computer Game of 1999''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.firaxis.com/smac/game.cfm| title=Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri: The Game| publisher=Firaxis| archivedate = 2008-01-24| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080124172058/www.firaxis.com/smac/game.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alpha Centauri'' has the distinction of receiving gaming magazine ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s highest score (98%),&lt;ref name=Tito2005p2/&gt; surpassing ''Civilization II''{{'}}s score (97%).&lt;ref name=&quot;pcgamer&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=PC Gamer|date=April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the release of the expansion, multimedia producer [[Michael Ely]] wrote a trilogy of novels based on the game. Illustrator [[Rafael Kayanan]] also wrote a [[graphic novel]] entitled ''Alpha Centauri: Power of the Mindworms''.&lt;ref name=&quot;OfficialSiteStory&quot;/&gt;

While not a direct sequel of ''Civilization II'', ''Alpha Centauri'' is considered a spiritual successor because it shares the same general principles and was made by many of the original developers. There have been no sequels beyond ''Alien Crossfire'', something that writer Greg Tito attributed to Reynolds leaving Firaxis in 2000 to form [[Big Huge Games]].&lt;ref name=Tito2005p2/&gt; ''Alien Crossfire'' producer and lead designer Timothy Train also left Firaxis with Reynolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/company.php?id=494 |title=Firaxis Games |publisher=Allgame.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the features introduced in ''Alpha Centauri'' were carried over into subsequent ''Civilization'' titles.&lt;ref name=Tito2005p2/&gt; For example, each civilization's characteristics in ''Civilization III'' are reminiscent of faction bonuses and penalties,&lt;ref name=Tito2005p2/&gt; the government system in ''[[Civilization IV]]'' closely resembles ''Alpha Centauri''{{'}}s,&lt;ref name=Tito2005p2/&gt; and ''[[Civilization V]]'' includes a new victory condition: the completion of the 'Utopia project', which is reminiscent of the Ascent to Transcendence secret project.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Edwards2010|Edwards (2010)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon its release, ''Civilization III'' was compared negatively to ''Alpha Centauri'',&lt;ref name=&quot;NewSeason&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Schiesel | first = Seth | authorlink = | title = The New Season Video Games; Going to War in the Matrix, Middle Earth, or the Bronx | work = The New York Times | publisher = | date = September 11, 2005 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F06E3DA1431F932A2575AC0A9639C8B63 | accessdate = November 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Edge'' magazine noted that ''Alpha Centauri'' remained &quot;highly regarded&quot; in 2006.&lt;ref name=Edge2006p2/&gt; [[Steve Jackson Games]] published ''[[GURPS Alpha Centauri]]'', a sourcebook for the [[GURPS]] [[role-playing game (pen and paper)|role-playing game]] set in the ''Alpha Centauri'' universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/books/alphacentauri/ Official homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; On May 7, 2010, Brendan Casey released an [[unofficial patch]], which fixes bugs in ''Alpha Centauri''.&lt;ref&gt;Casey, Brendan (also known as scient, 2010) [http://www.civgaming.net/forums/showthread.php?p=162396#post162396 &quot;Unofficial SMAC/X Patches Version 1.0&quot;], Civilization Gaming Networks Forums, May 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; His project began in February 2009 at Apolyton's Alpha Centauri site&lt;ref&gt;Casey, Brendan (2009) [http://www.apolyton.net/forums/showthread.php?p=5531636#post5531636 &quot;Fixing SMACX Bugs&quot;], Apolyton Civilizations Site Forums, February 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and moved in June 2009 to the Civilization Gaming Network,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civgaming.net/forums/showthread.php?p=161019#post161019 &quot;Orientation and Moderation&quot;], Civilization Gaming Networks Forums, June 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; where he plans to continue developing further patch versions.&lt;ref&gt;WePlayCiv [http://www.weplayciv.com//node/233 &quot;Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri / Alien Crossfire Unofficial Patch released!&quot;], ''WePlayCiv'', May 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sold-Out Software]] also re-released the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fink |url=http://www.mastertronic.com/productSoldOut.asp?pid=756&amp;productLabelID=1 |title=Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri Complete |publisher=Mastertronic |date= |accessdate=2011-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Is the re-release of the game ten years later really part of Legacy or is this WP:INDISCRIMINATE?--&gt;

Firaxis announced the title ''[[Civilization: Beyond Earth]]'' in April 2014, and was released on October 24, 2014; the game is a [[spiritual sequel]] to ''Alpha Centauri'', and several of those that worked on ''Alpha Centauri'' helped to develop the new title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/games/civilization_beyond_earth/b/pc/archive/2014/04/12/civilization-beyond-earth-announced-here-s-everything-you-want-to-know.aspx | title = Civilization: Beyond Earth | work = [[Game Informer]] | first = Mike | last = Futter | date = April 12, 2014 | accessdate = April 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
