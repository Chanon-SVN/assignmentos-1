'''Bromine''' (from {{lang-el|βρῶμος, ''brómos''}}, meaning &quot;strong-smelling&quot; or &quot;stench&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Turner, Edward |title=Elements of chemistry: including the recent discoveries and doctrines of the science|page=467|year=1828|quote=The name first applied to it by its discoverer is muride; but it has since been changed to brome..from the Greek βρῶμος signifying a strong or rank odour. This appellation may in the English language be properly converted into that of Bromine.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Br''', and [[atomic number]] 35. It is a [[halogen]]. The element was isolated independently by two chemists, [[Carl Jacob Löwig]] and [[Antoine Jerome Balard]], in 1825–1826. Elemental bromine is a fuming red-brown liquid at room temperature, [[Corrosive substance|corrosive]] and [[Toxicity|toxic]], with properties between those of [[chlorine]] and [[iodine]]. Free bromine does not occur in nature, but occurs as colorless soluble crystalline mineral halide [[Ionic salt|salts]], analogous to [[table salt]].

Bromine is rarer than about three-quarters of elements in the [[Earth]]'s crust. The high solubility of [[bromide]] [[ion]]s has caused its accumulation in the oceans, and commercially the element is easily extracted from [[brine]] pools, mostly in the United States, Israel and China. About 556,000 [[tonne]]s were produced in 2007, an amount similar to the far more abundant element [[magnesium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;USGSCR2007&quot;/&gt;

At high temperatures, [[organobromine compound]]s readily convert to free bromine atoms, a process which has the effect of stopping [[free radical]] chemical [[chain reaction]]s. This effect makes organobromine compounds useful as [[fire retardant]]s; more than half the bromine produced industrially worldwide each year is put to this use. Unfortunately, the same property causes [[sunlight]] to convert volatile organobromine compounds to free bromine atoms in the [[atmosphere]], and an unwanted side effect of this process is [[ozone depletion]]. As a result, many organobromide compounds that were formerly in common use—such as the [[pesticide]], [[Bromomethane|methyl bromide]]—have been abandoned. Bromine compounds are still used for purposes such as in [[well drilling fluids]], in [[photographic film]], and as an intermediate in the manufacture of [[organic compound|organic]] chemicals.

Bromine has been long believed to have no essential function in [[mammals]], but recent research suggests that bromine is necessary for tissue development. In addition, bromine is used preferentially over chlorine by one antiparasitic [[enzyme]] in the [[human immune system]].  Organobromides are needed and produced enzymatically from bromide by some lower life forms in the [[sea]], particularly [[algae]], and the ash of seaweed was one source of bromine's discovery. As a [[pharmaceutical]], the simple bromide ion, Br&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;, has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, and bromide [[salts]] were once a major medical sedative, before being replaced by shorter-acting drugs. They retain niche uses as [[antiepileptic]]s.

==Characteristics==

===Physical===
[[File:Bromine vial in acrylic cube.jpg|thumb|left|[[Poly(methyl methacrylate)#Acrylate resin casting|Illustrative and secure]] bromine sample for teaching]]
The element bromine exists as a [[diatomic molecule]], Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It is a dense, mobile, slightly transparent reddish-brown [[liquid]], that evaporates easily at [[standard temperature and pressure]]s to give an orange vapor (its color resembles [[nitrogen dioxide]]) that has a strongly disagreeable odor resembling that of [[chlorine]]. It is one of only two elements on the [[periodic table]] that are known to be liquids at room temperature ([[mercury (element)|mercury]] is the other, although [[caesium]], [[gallium]], and [[rubidium]] melt just above room temperature).

At a pressure of 55&amp;nbsp;[[GPa]] (roughly 540,000 times atmospheric pressure) bromine converts to a [[metal]]. At 75&amp;nbsp;GPa it converts to a face centered orthorhombic structure. At 100&amp;nbsp;GPa it converts to a body centered orthorhombic monatomic form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author = Duan, Defang et al.|title = Ab initio studies of solid bromine under high pressure|journal = Physical Review B|volume = 76|date = 2007-09-26|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.76.104113|page = 104113|bibcode = 2007PhRvB..76j4113D|issue = 10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical===
Being less reactive than [[chlorine]] but more reactive than [[iodine]], bromine reacts vigorously with metals, especially in the presence of [[water]], to give bromide salts. It is also reactive toward most organic compounds, especially upon [[photochemistry|illumination]], conditions that favor the dissociation of the diatomic molecule into bromine radicals:

: Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{eqm}} 2 Br'''·'''

It [[chemical bond|bonds]] easily with many elements and has a strong [[Bleach (chemical)|bleaching]] action.

Bromine is slightly [[solubility|soluble]] in [[water (molecule)|water]], but it is highly soluble in organic solvents such as [[carbon disulfide]], [[carbon tetrachloride]], [[aliphatic]] [[alcohol]]s, and [[acetic acid]].

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of bromine}}
Bromine has two stable [[isotope]]s, &lt;sup&gt;79&lt;/sup&gt;Br (50.69%) and &lt;sup&gt;81&lt;/sup&gt;Br (49.31%). At least 23 [[radioisotopes]] are known. Many of the bromine isotopes are fission products. Several of the heavier bromine isotopes from [[Nuclear fission|fission]] are delayed neutron emitters, important to the controllability of a nuclear reactor. All of the radioactive bromine isotopes are relatively short lived. The longest half-life is the neutron deficient &lt;sup&gt;77&lt;/sup&gt;Br at 2.376 days. The longest [[half-life]] on the neutron rich side is &lt;sup&gt;82&lt;/sup&gt;Br at 1.471 days. A number of the bromine isotopes exhibit metastable isomers. Stable &lt;sup&gt;79&lt;/sup&gt;Br exhibits a radioactive [[nuclear isomer|isomer]], with a half-life of 4.86 seconds. It decays by isomeric transition to the stable ground state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Audi|first = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties|journal = Nuclear Physics A|volume = 729|page = 3| publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center|year = 2003|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A|last2 = Bersillon|first2 = O.|last3 = Blachot|first3 = J.|last4 = Wapstra|first4 = A.H.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The isotopes of bromine range from &lt;sup&gt;67&lt;/sup&gt;Br to &lt;sup&gt;98&lt;/sup&gt;Br. One of these, &lt;sup&gt;67&lt;/sup&gt;Br has an unknown [[half life]]. Six isotopes, &lt;sup&gt;95&lt;/sup&gt;Br to &lt;sup&gt;98&lt;/sup&gt;Br, &lt;sup&gt;68&lt;/sup&gt;Br, and &lt;sup&gt;69&lt;/sup&gt;Br have half-lives under a [[microsecond]]. The isotopes &lt;sup&gt;91&lt;/sup&gt;Br to &lt;sup&gt;94&lt;/sup&gt;Br and &lt;sup&gt;70&lt;/sup&gt;Br have half lives of a microsecond to a second. All but two of the remaining isotopes of bromine have half lives of 1 second to 10,000,000 seconds. The other two, &lt;sup&gt;79&lt;/sup&gt;Br and &lt;sup&gt;81&lt;/sup&gt;Br, are stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author = Alejandro Sonzogni|url = http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/nudat2/reZoom.jsp?newZoom=4|title = NuDat 2.6|accessdate = 2013-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three lightest isotopes of bromine (&lt;sup&gt;67&lt;/sup&gt;Br to &lt;sup&gt;69&lt;/sup&gt;Br) decay via [[proton emission]]. The isotopes &lt;sup&gt;70&lt;/sup&gt;Br through &lt;sup&gt;78&lt;/sup&gt;Br decay via [[electron capture]] or [[positron emission]]. &lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt;Br and &lt;sup&gt;82&lt;/sup&gt;Br to &lt;sup&gt;97&lt;/sup&gt;Br decay via [[electron emission]]. &lt;sup&gt;98&lt;/sup&gt;Br decays via [[neutron emission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author = Alejandro Sonzogni|url = http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/nudat2/reColor.jsp?newColor=dm|title = NuDat 2.6|accessdate = 2013-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bromine was discovered independently by two chemists, [[Carl Jacob Löwig]]&lt;ref name=L1/&gt; and [[Antoine Jerome Balard|Antoine Balard]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Bal1826&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Balard&quot;/&gt; in 1825 and 1826, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The discovery of the elements: XVII. The halogen family|last = Weeks|first = Mary Elvira|authorlink=Mary Elvira Weeks|journal = Journal of Chemical Education|year = 1932|volume = 9|page = 1915|doi = 10.1021/ed009p1915|bibcode=1932JChEd...9.1915W|issue = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balard found bromine chemicals in the ash of [[seaweed]] from the [[salt marsh]]es of [[Montpellier]]. The seaweed was used to produce iodine, but also contained bromine. Balard distilled the bromine from a solution of seaweed ash saturated with chlorine. The properties of the resulting substance resembled that of an intermediate of chlorine and iodine; with those results he tried to prove that the substance was [[iodine monochloride]] (ICl), but after failing to do so he was sure that he had found a new element and named it muride, derived from the [[Latin]] word ''muria'' for brine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Balard&quot; /&gt;

Löwig isolated bromine from a mineral water spring from his hometown [[Bad Kreuznach]] in 1825. Löwig used a solution of the mineral salt saturated with chlorine and extracted the bromine with [[diethyl ether]]. After evaporation of the ether a brown liquid remained. With this liquid as a sample for his work he applied for a position in the laboratory of [[Leopold Gmelin]] in [[Heidelberg]]. The publication of the results was delayed and Balard published his results first.&lt;ref name=&quot;Löwig&quot; /&gt;

After the French chemists [[Louis Nicolas Vauquelin]], [[Louis Jacques Thénard]], and [[Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac]] approved the experiments of the young pharmacist Balard, the results were presented at a lecture of the [[Académie des Sciences]] and published in ''Annales de Chimie et Physique''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bal1826&quot; /&gt; In his publication Balard states that he changed the name from ''muride'' to ''brôme'' on the proposal of M. Anglada. (''Brôme'' (bromine) derives from the Greek βρωμος (stench).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bal1826&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bal1826b&quot;/&gt;) Other sources claim that the French chemist and physicist [[Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac]] suggested the name ''brôme'' for the characteristic smell of the vapors.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wisniak&quot;/&gt; Bromine was not produced in large quantities until 1860.

&lt;!-- Some also suggest that it may have been discovered by [[Bernard Courtois]], the man who discovered iodine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url = http://www.vanderkrogt.net/elements/elem/br.html
|title = Bromine
|publisher = vanderkrogt.net }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;
The first commercial use, besides some minor medical applications, was the use of bromine for the [[daguerreotype]]. In 1840 it was discovered that bromine had some advantages over the previously used iodine vapor to create the light sensitive [[silver halide]] layer used for daguerreotypy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Daguerreotype: Nineteenth-century Technology and Modern Science|first = M.

[[Potassium bromide]] and [[sodium bromide]] were used as [[anticonvulsant]]s and [[sedative]]s in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, until they were gradually superseded by [[chloral hydrate]] and then the [[barbiturate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A History of Psychiatry: From the Era of the Asylum to the Age of Prozac|first = Edward|last = Shorter| publisher = John Wiley and Sons|year = 1997|isbn = 978-0-471-24531-5|page =200}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years of the [[First World War]], bromine compounds such as [[xylyl bromide]] were used as [[poison gas]].&lt;ref&gt;Sam Kean.

The diatomic element Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; does not occur naturally. Instead, bromine exists exclusively as [[Bromide|bromide salts]] in diffuse amounts in [[crust (geology)|crustal]] rock. Owing to [[Leaching (chemical science)|leaching]], bromide salts have accumulated in sea water at 65 [[parts per million]] (ppm),&lt;ref name=o1/&gt; which is less than chloride. Bromine may be economically recovered from bromide-rich [[Salt well|brine wells]] and from the [[Dead Sea]] waters (up to 50,000 ppm).&lt;ref name=o2/&gt;&lt;ref name=o3/&gt; It exists in the Earth's crust at an average concentration of 0.4 ppm, making it the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|62nd most abundant element]]. The bromine concentration in soils varies normally between 5 and 40 ppm, but some volcanic soils can contain up to 500 ppm. The concentration of bromine in the atmosphere is extremely low, at only a few [[parts per trillion|ppt]].&lt;ref name=emsley/&gt; A large number of organobromine compounds are found in small amounts in nature.

China's bromine reserves are located in the [[Shandong Province]] and Israel's bromine reserves are contained in the waters of the [[Dead Sea]].&lt;ref name=laurence&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-29376436|title=Who's afraid of bromine?|author=Laurence Knight|work=BBC news|date=27 September 2014|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest bromine reserve in the United States is located in [[Columbia County, Arkansas|Columbia County]] and [[Union County, Arkansas]], U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cals.lib.ar.us/butlercenter/lesson_plans/lesson%20plans/Lesson%20plans-retained/Bromine.pdf |title=Bromine:An Important Arkansas Industry|publisher= Butler Center for Arkansas Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Bromine production has increased sixfold since the 1960s. Approximately 556,000 tonnes (worth around US $2.5 billion) were produced in 2007 worldwide, with the predominant contribution from the United States (226,000 t) and [[Israel]] (210,000 t).&lt;ref name=&quot;USGSCR2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=emsley/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USGSYB2007&quot;/&gt; US production was excluded from the [[United States Geological Survey]] after 2007, and from the 380,000 tonnes mined by other countries in 2010, 140,000 t were produced by China, 130,000 t by Israel and 80,000 t by Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/bromine/mcs-2011-bromi.pdf Bromine]. USGS 2011 mineral commodities report&lt;/ref&gt;

Bromide-rich brines are treated with chlorine gas, flushing through with air. In this treatment, bromide anions are oxidized to bromine by the chlorine gas.
:2 Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

===Laboratory methods of production===
In the laboratory, because of its commercial availability and long shelf-life, bromine is not typically prepared. Small amounts of bromine can however be generated through the reaction of solid [[sodium bromide]] with concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The first stage is formation of [[hydrogen bromide]] (HBr), which is a gas, but under the reaction conditions some of the HBr is oxidized further by the sulfuric acid to form bromine (Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[sulfur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).
:NaBr (s) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) → HBr (aq) + NaHSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq)
:2 HBr (aq) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) → Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l)

Non oxidizing acid alternatives, such as the use of dilute [[hydrobromic acid]] with sodium [[hypobromite]], are also available, as the [[hypobromous acid]] formed from them is unstable in the presence of bromide, being reduced by it according to the reaction:

: 2 OBr&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (aq) + 4 HBr (aq) → 2Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2Br&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

The reactions are the reverse of [[disproportionation]] reactions of elemental bromine in base, and are called [[comproportionation]]. A similar reaction happens with sodium hypochlorite, acid, and chloride, leading to elemental chlorine.

Reactions involving an oxidizing agent, such as [[potassium permanganate]] or [[manganese dioxide]], on bromide ions in the presence of an acid, also give bromine in the reactions analogous to the formation of elemental chlorine and iodine from an acid and oxidant.

Like iodine, bromine is soluble in [[chloroform]] but only slightly soluble in water. In water, the solubility can be increased by the presence of bromide ions. Concentrated solutions of bromine are rarely prepared in the lab because of hazards. As is the case with chlorine solutions or iodine solutions, [[sodium thiosulphate]] (or any soluble thiosulphate) is an effective reagent for reducing bromine to colorless odorless bromide, thus dealing with stains and odor from the element in unwanted places. For the same reason, thiosulfate (&quot;fixer's hypo&quot;) is used in photography to deal with free bromine in silver bromide film emulsions.

==Compounds and chemistry==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2010}}

===Organic chemistry===
{{Main|Organobromine compound}}
[[File:N-Bromosuccinimide.svg|thumb|right|150px|''N''-Bromosuccinimide]]
As with other halogens, bromine substitutes for hydrogen in hydrocarbons, bonding covalently to carbon. As with other halogens, the C-Br product of this substitution is generally colorless if the corresponding C-H compound is colorless. Addition of covalently bonded bromine tends to increase the density and raise the melting point of organic compounds.

Organic compounds are brominated by either [[Addition reaction|addition]] or [[Substitution (chemistry)|substitution reactions]]. Bromine undergoes electrophilic addition to the double-bonds of [[alkene]]s, via a cyclic bromonium intermediate. In non-aqueous solvents such as [[carbon disulfide]], this yields the di-bromo product. For example, reaction with [[ethylene]] will produce [[1,2-Dibromoethane|1,2-dibromoethane]]. Bromine also undergoes electrophilic substitution to [[phenols]] and [[aniline]]s. When used as bromine water, a small amount of the corresponding [[halohydrin formation reaction|bromohydrin is formed]] as well as the dibromo compound. So reliable is the reactivity of bromine that bromine water is employed as a reagent to test for the presence of alkenes, phenols, and anilines. Like the other halogens, bromine participates in [[free radical reaction]]s. For example, hydrocarbons are brominated upon treatment with bromine in the presence of light.

Bromine, sometimes with a catalytic amount of [[phosphorus]], easily brominates [[carboxylic acid]]s at the α-position. This method, the [[Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction]], is the basis of the commercial route to [[bromoacetic acid]]. [[N-Bromosuccinimide|''N''-Bromosuccinimide]] is commonly used as a substitute for elemental bromine, being easier to handle, and reacting more mildly and thus more selectively. Organic bromides are often preferable relative to the less reactive chlorides and more expensive iodide-containing reagents. Thus, [[Grignard reaction|Grignard]] and organolithium compound are most often generated from the corresponding bromides.

Certain bromine-related compounds have been evaluated to have an [[ozone depletion potential]] or bioaccumulate in living organisms. As a result, many industrial bromine compounds are no longer manufactured, are being restricted, or scheduled for phasing out. The [[Montreal Protocol]] mentions several organobromine compounds for this phase out.

===Inorganic chemistry===
{{See also|Category:Bromine compounds}}
Inorganic bromine compounds adopt a variety of oxidation states from −1 to +7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd|page=806}}&lt;/ref&gt; In nature, bromide (Br&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) is by far the most common state, and departures from this -1 oxidation state are entirely due to living organisms and bromide's interaction with biologically produced oxidants, such as free oxygen.

Like other halogens, bromide ion is colorless, and forms a number of transparent ionic mineral salts, analogous to chloride. Bromide ion is highly soluble in water.

Examples of compounds for bromine's various oxidation states are shown below:

Bromine is an oxidizer, and it will oxidize [[iodide]] ions to iodine, being itself reduced to [[bromide]]:

: Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → 2 Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Bromine will also oxidize metals and metalloids to the corresponding bromides. [[Anhydrous]] bromine is less reactive toward many metals than hydrated bromine, however. Dry bromine reacts vigorously with [[aluminium]], [[titanium]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]] as well as [[alkaline earth metal|alkaline earths]] and [[alkali metal]]s.

Dissolving bromine in alkaline solution gives a mixture of bromide and [[hypobromite]]:

:Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + OBr&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
This hypobromite is responsible for the bleaching abilities of bromide solutions. Warming of these solutions causes the disproportion reaction of the hypobromite to give [[bromate]], a strong oxidising agent very similar to chlorate.

: 3 {{chem|BrO|-}} → {{chem|BrO|3|-}} + 2 {{chem|Br|-}}

In contrast to the route to [[perchlorate]]s, perbromates are not accessible through electrolysis but only by reacting bromate solutions with [[fluorine]] or [[ozone]].

: BrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → {{chem|BrO|4|−}} + 2 HF
: BrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → {{chem|BrO|4|−}} + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Bromine reacts violently and explosively with aluminium metal, forming aluminium bromide:

:2 Al + 3 Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 [[aluminium bromide|AlBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]

Bromine reacts with hydrogen in gaseous form and gives [[hydrogen bromide]]:

:[[hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2[[hydrogen bromide|HBr]]

Bromine reacts with [[alkali metal]] iodides in a displacement reaction. This reaction forms alkali metal bromides and produces elemental [[iodine]]:

:2 [[sodium iodide|NaI]] + Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 [[sodium bromide|NaBr]] + I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:2 [[potassium iodide|KI]] + Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 [[potassium bromide|KBr]] + I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

==Applications==
A wide variety of organobromine compounds are used in [[industry]]. Some are prepared from bromine and others are prepared from [[hydrogen bromide]], which is obtained by burning [[hydrogen]] in bromine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullmann&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Mills, Jack F.  |title=Bromine: in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|publisher= Wiley-VCH Verlag|location= Weinheim|year= 2002|doi=10.1002/14356007.a04_391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flame retardant===
[[File:Tetrabromobisphenol A.svg|thumb|right|Tetrabromobisphenol A]]

[[Brominated flame retardant]]s represent a commodity of growing importance, and represent the largest commercial use of bromine. When the brominated material burns, the flame retardant produces [[hydrobromic acid]] which interferes in the radical [[chain reaction]] of the [[oxidation]] reaction of the fire. The mechanism is that the highly reactive hydrogen radicals, oxygen radicals, and hydroxy radicals react with hydrobromic acid to form less reactive bromine radicals (i.e., free bromine atoms). Bromine atoms may also react directly with other radicals to help terminate the free radical chain-reactions that characterize combustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Journal of Fire Sciences|volume = 14|page = 426| year = 1996|doi = 10.1177/073490419601400602|title = Mechanisms for Flame Retardancy and Smoke suppression – A Review|first =Joseph|last = Green|issue = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Polymer Degradation and Stability|volume = 77|year = 2002|page = 325| doi = 10.1016/S0141-3910(02)00067-8|title = Fire retardant mechanism of aliphatic bromine compounds in polystyrene and polypropylene|first = Jelle|last = Kaspersma|coauthors = Doumena, Cindy; Munrob Sheilaand; Prinsa, Anne-Marie|issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To make brominated polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can incorporated into the polymer during [[polymerization]]. One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerization process. For example, [[vinyl bromide]] can be used in the production of [[polyethylene]], [[polyvinylchloride]] or [[polypropylene]]. Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerization process For example, [[tetrabromobisphenol A]] can be added to [[polyester]]s or epoxy resins, where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxys used in [[printed circuit board]]s are normally made from such '''f'''lame '''r'''etardant [[resin]]s, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products ([[FR-4]] and [[FR-2]]). In some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after polymerization. For example, [[decabromodiphenyl ether]] can be added to the final polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Journal of Fire Sciences|volume = 22|page = 25| year = 2004|doi = 10.1177/0734904104038107|title = A Review of Current Flame Retardant Systems for Epoxy Resins|first = Edward D.|last = Weil|author2=Levchik, Sergei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of gaseous or highly volatile brominated [[halomethane]] compounds are non-toxic and make superior fire suppressant agents by this same mechanism, and are particular effective in enclosed spaces such as submarines, airplanes, and spacecraft. However, they are expensive and their production and use has been greatly curtailed due to their effect as ozone-depleting agents. They are no longer used in routine fire extinguishers, but retain niche uses in aerospace and military automatic fire-suppression applications. They include [[bromochloromethane]] (Halon 1011, CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BrCl), [[bromochlorodifluoromethane]] (Halon 1211, CBrClF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[bromotrifluoromethane]] (Halon 1301, CBrF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

===Gasoline additive===
[[1,2-Dibromoethane|Ethylene bromide]] was an [[Gasoline additive|additive in gasolines]] containing lead anti-[[engine knocking]] agents. It scavenges lead by forming volatile lead bromide, which is exhausted from the engine. This application accounted for 77% of the bromine use in 1966 in the US. This application has declined since the 1970s due to environmental regulations (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Environment International|volume = 29|year = 2003| doi = 10.1016/S0160-4120(03)00121-1|title = An overview of commercially used brominated flame retardants, their applications, their use patterns in different countries/regions and possible modes of release|first = Mehran|last = Alaeea|coauthors = Ariasb, Pedro; Sjödinc, Andreas; Bergman, Åke|issue = 6|pmid=12850087|pages = 683–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pesticide===

Poisonous [[methyl bromide]] was widely used as [[pesticide]] to [[Fumigation|fumigate]] soil and to fumigate housing, by the tenting method. Ethylene bromide was similarly used.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGSYB2007&quot; /&gt; These volatile organobromine compounds are all now regulated as [[ozone depletion]] agents. The [[Montreal Protocol|Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone]] scheduled the phase out for the [[ozone depleting]] chemical by 2005, and organobromide pesticides are no longer used (in housing fumagation they have been replaced by such compounds as [[sulfuryl fluoride]], which contain neither the chlorine or bromine organics which harm ozone). Prior to the Montreal protocol in 1991 (for example) an estimated 35,000 tonnes of the chemical were used to control [[nematodes]], [[fungi]], [[weed]]s and other soil-borne diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Alternatives to Methyl Bromide for the Control of Soil-Borne Diseases and Pests in California|first = Belinda|last = Messenger|author2=Braun, Adolf|year = 2000|publisher = Pest Management Analysis and Planning Program|url = http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/emon/methbrom/alt-anal/sept2000.pdf|accessdate = 2008-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Economics of the &quot;Critical Use&quot; of Methyl bromide under the Montreal Protocol|doi = 10.1093/cep/byi028|journal =Contemporary Economic Policy|volume = 23|page = 376|year = 2008|first = Stephen J.|last = Decanio|author2=Norman, Catherine S.|issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical and veterinary===
[[File:Potassium bromide.jpg|right|thumb|Potassium bromide]]

{{main|potassium bromide}}
'''Use.'''  [[Bromide]] compounds, especially [[potassium bromide]], were frequently used as general sedatives in the 19th and early 20th century. Bromides in the form of simple salts are still used as anticonvulsants in both veterinary and human medicine, although the latter use varies from country to country. For example, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) does not approve bromide for the treatment of any disease, and it was removed from over-the-counter sedative products like [[Bromo-Seltzer]], in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Hopkins Adams|title=The Great American fraud|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fd_S2Van52EC|accessdate=2011-06-25 |year=1905|publisher=Press of the American Medical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, bromide levels are not routinely measured by medical laboratories in the U.S. However, U.S. veterinary medical diagnostic testing laboratories will measure blood bromide levels on request, as an aid to treatment of [[epilepsy in dogs]].

'''Toxicity.'''  Long-term use of potassium bromide (or any bromide salt) can lead to [[bromism]]. This state of central nervous system depression causes the moderate toxicity of bromide in multi-gram doses for humans and other mammals. The very long half-life of bromide ion in the body (~12 days) also contributes to toxicity from bromide build-up in body fluids. Bromide ingestion may also cause a skin eruption resembling [[acne]].&lt;!--http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1506256 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4108963 http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1081/CLT-120019135 http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pdf_extract/135/7/857 http://journals.lww.com/smajournalonline/Abstract/1975/02000/Bromism__Recent_Perspectives.23.aspx --&gt;

* Bromine is also used to reduce mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants. This can be achieved either by treating [[activated carbon]] with bromine or by injecting bromine compounds onto the coal prior to combustion.
* Bromine can also be artificially substituted for the methyl substituent in the nitrogenous base thymine of DNA, creating the base analog [[5-bromouracil]]. When this base is incorporated into DNA its different hydrogen bonding properties may cause mutation at the site of that base pair. The compound 5-bromouracil is thus an artificial mutagen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nester EW, Anderson DG and Roberts CE, Jr.|title=Loose Leaf Version of Microbiology: A Human Perspective|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rbl9PgAACAAJ|accessdate=2011-06-25 |date=4 June 2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0-07-736647-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

Recently, bromine (as bromide) was shown to be an essential cofactor for the peroxidasin catalyzed formation of sulfilimine crosslinks in collagen IV.  Since this is a post-translational modification that occurs in all animals, bromine is therefore an essential trace element for humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid24906154&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| author = McCall AS, Cummings CF, Bhave G, Vanacore R, Page-McCaw A, Hudson BG|title = Bromine Is an Essential Trace Element for Assembly of Collagen IV Scaffolds in Tissue Development and Architecture|journal = Cell|volume = 157|issue = 6|pages = 1380–92|year = 2014|pmid = 24906154|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2014.05.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inorganic bromine and [[organobromine compound]]s also perform other biological functions, which may be essential, or at least optimal and preferred.

==Safety==
{{See also|List of highly toxic gases}}

Elemental bromine is toxic and [[Irritant (biology)|causes burns]]. As an [[oxidizing]] agent, it is incompatible with most organic and inorganic compounds. Care needs to be taken when transporting bromine; it is commonly carried in steel tanks lined with lead, supported by strong metal frames.

When certain ionic compounds containing bromine are mixed with [[potassium permanganate]] (KMnO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and an acidic substance, they will form a pale brown cloud of bromine gas.

: 6 Br&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 {{chem|MnO|4|-}} + 8 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → 3 Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

This gas smells like bleach and is very irritating to the mucous membranes. Upon exposure, one should move to fresh air immediately. If symptoms of bromine poisoning arise, medical attention is needed.
