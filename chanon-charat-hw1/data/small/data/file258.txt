'''Apple Inc.''' is an American [[multinational corporation]] headquartered in [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]], [[California]], that designs, develops, and sells [[consumer electronics]], computer software, online services, and personal computers. Its best-known hardware products are the [[Macintosh|Mac]] line of computers, the [[iPod]] [[Mobile digital media player|media player]], the [[iPhone]] [[smartphone]], and the [[iPad]] [[tablet computer]]. Its online services include [[iCloud]], [[iTunes Store]], and [[App Store]]. Apple's consumer software includes the [[OS X]] and [[iOS]] [[operating system]]s, the [[iTunes]] media browser, the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser, and the [[iLife]] and [[iWork]] creativity and productivity suites.

Apple was founded by [[Steve Jobs]], [[Steve Wozniak]], and [[Ronald Wayne]] on April 1, 1976, to develop and sell [[personal computers]]. It was incorporated as '''Apple Computer, Inc.''' on January 3, 1977, and was renamed as Apple Inc. on January 9, 2007, to reflect its shifted focus towards consumer electronics.

Apple is the [[List of the largest information technology companies|world's second-largest information technology company]] by revenue after [[Samsung Electronics]], and the [[Mobile phone#Manufacturers|world's third-largest mobile phone maker]]. On November 25, 2014, in addition to being the [[List of corporations by market capitalization|largest publicly traded corporation in the world by market capitalization]], Apple became the first U.S. company to be valued at over $700B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Apple Inc market cap tops US$700B, double what it was when Tim Cook took over as CEO|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2014/11/25/apple-inc-tops-us700-billion-market-share-on-strong-iphone-and-ipad-demand/?__lsa=3e9b-d49b|accessdate=November 25, 2014|publisher=Financial Post|date=November 25, 2014&lt;!-- 9:55 AM ET--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, Apple employs 72,800 permanent full-time employees, maintains 437 [[Apple Store|retail stores]] in fifteen countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Number of Apple stores worldwide 2005-2014|url=http://www.statista.com/statistics/273480/number-of-apple-stores-worldwide-since-2005/|website=[[Statista]]|accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and operates the online [[Apple Store (online)|Apple Store]] and iTunes Store, the latter of which is the world's largest music retailer.

Apple's worldwide annual revenue in 2014 totaled [[United States dollar|US$]]182 billion (FY end October 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Financials for Apple Inc.|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/aapl/financials|website=Market Watch|accessdate=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Apple enjoys a high level of brand loyalty and, according to the 2014 edition of the [[Interbrand]] Best Global Brands report, is the world's most valuable brand with a valuation of $118.9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elliott|first1=Stuart|title=Technology Titans Lead Ranking of Most Valuable Brands|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/business/media/tech-companies-lead-ranking-of-most-valuable-brands-.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2014, the corporation continued to manage significant [[Criticism of Apple Inc.|criticism]] regarding the labor practices of its contractors, as well as for its environmental and business practices, including the origins of source materials.

The [[Apple II series|Apple II]], also invented by Wozniak, was introduced on April 16, 1977, at the first [[West Coast Computer Faire]]. It differed from its major rivals, the [[TRS-80]] and [[Commodore PET]], because of its character cell-based color graphics and [[open architecture]]. While early Apple II models used ordinary cassette tapes as storage devices, they were superseded by the introduction of a 5&amp;nbsp;1/4&amp;nbsp;inch [[floppy disk]] drive and interface called the [[Disk II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Apple II History Chapter 4 | url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah04/ | author=Steven Weyhrich| date=April 21, 2002 | accessdate=August 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Apple II was chosen to be the desktop platform for the first &quot;[[killer application|killer app]]&quot; of the business world: [[VisiCalc]], a [[spreadsheet]] [[Computer program|program]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lemvc&quot;&gt;Hormby, Thomas.

Apple began working on the [[Apple Lisa]] in 1978. In 1982, Jobs was pushed from the Lisa team due to infighting. Jobs took over Jef Raskin's low-cost-computer project, the [[Macintosh]]. A race broke out between the Lisa team and the Macintosh team over which product would ship first. Lisa won the race in 1983 and became the first personal computer sold to the public with a GUI, but was a commercial failure due to its high price tag and limited software titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemlisa&quot;&gt;Hormby, Thomas.

The machine's fortunes changed with the introduction of the [[LaserWriter]], the first [[PostScript]] [[laser printer]] to be sold at a reasonable price, and [[PageMaker]], an early [[desktop publishing]] package.

Rather than submit to Sculley's direction, Jobs attempted to oust him from his leadership role at Apple. Sculley found out that Jobs had been attempting to organize a [[coup]] and called a board meeting at which Apple's board of directors sided with Sculley and removed Jobs from his managerial duties.&lt;ref name=&quot;lem1985&quot; /&gt; Jobs resigned from Apple and founded [[NeXT|NeXT Inc.]] the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Spector| first = G| title = Apple's Jobs Starts New Firm, Targets Education Market| work = [[PC Week]]| page = 109| date = September 24, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Macintosh Portable]] was introduced in 1989 and was designed to be just as powerful as a desktop Macintosh, but weighed {{convert|7.5|kg}} with a 12-hour battery life. After the Macintosh Portable, Apple introduced the [[PowerBook]] in 1991. The same year, Apple introduced [[System 7]], a major upgrade to the operating system which added color to the interface and introduced new networking capabilities. It remained the architectural basis for [[Mac OS]] until 2001. The success of the PowerBook and other products brought increasing revenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemsculley&quot; /&gt; For some time, Apple was doing incredibly well, introducing fresh new products and generating increasing profits in the process. The magazine ''[[MacLife|MacAddict]]'' named the period between 1989 and 1991 as the &quot;first golden age&quot; of the Macintosh.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

By the early 1990s, Apple was developing alternative platforms to the Macintosh, such as the [[A/UX]]. Apple had also begun to experiment with providing a Mac-only online portal which they called [[eWorld]], which was developed in collaboration with [[America Online]] and designed as a Mac-friendly alternative to other online services such as [[CompuServe]]. The Macintosh platform itself was becoming outdated because it was not built for multitasking and because several important software routines were programmed directly into the hardware. In addition, Apple was facing competition from [[OS/2]] and [[UNIX]] vendors such as [[Sun Microsystems]]. The Macintosh would need to be replaced by a new platform or reworked to run on more powerful hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/B8DA34A3-333B-4204-BDF3-E74608998702.html| title=1990–1995: Hitting the Wall|accessdate=August 14, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080924063130/http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/Home/B8DA34A3-333B-4204-BDF3-E74608998702.html| archivedate= September 24, 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Apple allied with [[IBM]] and [[Motorola]] in the [[AIM alliance]] with the goal of creating a new computing platform (the [[PowerPC Reference Platform]]), which would use IBM and Motorola hardware coupled with Apple software. The AIM alliance hoped that PReP's performance and Apple's software would leave the PC far behind and thus counter Microsoft. The same year, Apple introduced the [[Power Macintosh]], the first of many Apple computers to use Motorola's [[PowerPC]] processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple-history.com/body.php?page=gallery&amp;model=6100&amp;performa=off&amp;sort=date&amp;order=ASC&amp;range=|title=Power Macintosh 6100|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After years of speculation and multiple rumored &quot;leaks&quot;, Apple announced a large screen, tablet-like media device known as the iPad on January 27, 2010. The iPad ran the same touch based operating system that the iPhone used, and many iPhone apps were compatible with the iPad. This gave the iPad a large app catalog on launch despite very little development time before the release. Later that year on April 3, 2010, the iPad was launched in the US. It sold more than 300,000 units on its first day, and 500,000 by the end of the first week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/04/05ipad.html| title=Apple Sells Over 300,000 iPads First Day| publisher=Apple Inc| accessdate=April 10, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100409114930/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/04/05ipad.html| archivedate= April 9, 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May of the same year, Apple's [[market cap]] exceeded that of competitor [[Microsoft]] for the first time since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/10168684.stm|title=Apple passes Microsoft to be biggest tech company|date=May 27, 2010|accessdate=May 29, 2010|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100529063247/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/10168684.stm| archivedate= May 29, 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 17, 2011, Jobs announced in an internal Apple memo that he would take another medical leave of absence, for an indefinite period, to allow him to focus on his health.

It provided an incremental update to the device, including faster internal components, support for faster 3G speeds, video recording capability, and voice control.

At the [[Worldwide Developers Conference]] (WWDC) on June 7, 2010, Apple announced the redesigned [[iPhone 4]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/06/07/apple.wwdc.preview/index.html|title=Apple unveils iPhone 4, 'biggest leap we've taken' since first model|work=[[CNN]]|first1=Brandon |last1=Griggs | first2=John D. |last2= Sutter|date=June 8, 2010|accessdate=July 5, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100708063056/http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/mobile/06/07/apple.wwdc.preview/index.html| archivedate= July 8, 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured a 960x640 display, the [[Apple A4]] processor, a [[gyroscope]] for enhanced gaming, a 5MP camera with LED flash, front-facing [[VGA]] camera and [[FaceTime]] video calling. Shortly after its release, reception issues were discovered by consumers, due to the stainless steel band around the edge of the device, which also serves as the phone's cellular signal and Wi-Fi antenna. The issue was corrected by a &quot;Bumper Case&quot; distributed by Apple for free to all owners for a few months. In June 2011, Apple overtook [[Nokia]] to become the world's biggest smartphone maker by volume.&lt;ref name=ftover&gt;{{cite news |last=Ward| first=Andrew| title=Apple overtakes Nokia in smartphone stakes| url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/4d7fd1e2-b38e-11e0-b56c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1SlYjA4IS| newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 4, 2011, Apple unveiled the [[iPhone 4S]], which was first released on October 14, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://osxdaily.com/2011/10/05/iphone-4s-availability/|title=iPhone 4S Availability|publisher=OS X Daily|accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features the [[Apple A5]] processor and [[Siri]] voice assistant technology, the latter of which Apple had acquired in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/semantic-web/siri-acquired-by-apple-iphone-becomes-the-virtual-personal-assistant/371| title=Siri acquired by Apple; iPhone becomes the Virtual Personal Assistant?| publisher= [[ZDNet]]| accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also features an updated 8MP camera with new optics.

On September 12, 2012, Apple introduced the [[iPhone 5]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statista.com/topics/870/iphone/ Statistics and Facts about the iPhone]. [[Statista]], April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It added a 4-inch display, 4G LTE connectivity, and the upgraded [[Apple A6]] chip, among several other improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=iPhone 5 is World's Best-Selling Smartphone|work=[[PC Magazine]]| first= Angela| last = Moscartello| date= February 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two million iPhones were sold in the first twenty-four hours of pre-ordering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/09/17iPhone-5-Pre-Orders-Top-Two-Million-in-First-24-Hours.html|title=iPhone 5 Pre-Orders Top Two Million in First 24 Hours|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=January 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over five million handsets were sold in the first three days of its launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2012/09/24iPhone-5-First-Weekend-Sales-Top-Five-Million.html|title=iPhone 5 First Weekend Sales Top Five Million|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=January 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the launch of the [[iPhone 5S]] and [[iPhone 5C]], Apple set a new record for first-weekend smartphone sales by selling over nine million devices in the first three days of its launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/09/23/225418022/apple-sells-9-million-new-iphones-in-opening-weekend|title=Apple Sells 9 Million New iPhones In Opening Weekend|publisher=[[NPR]].|accessdate=September 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of the iPhone 5S and 5C was the first time that Apple simultaneously launched two models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Apple polishes forecast after selling 9 million new iPhones|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/09/23/us-apple-iphone-idUSBRE98J0LD20130923|accessdate=September 24, 2013|newspaper=Reuters|date=September 23, 2013|author=Poornima Gupta|author2=Jennifer Saba}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A patent filed in July 2013 revealed the development of a new iPhone battery system that uses location data in combination with data on the user's habits to moderate the handsets power settings accordingly. Apple is working towards a power management system that will provide features such as the ability of the iPhone to estimate the length of time a user will be away from a power source to modify energy usage and a detection function that adjusts the charging rate to best suit the type of power source that is being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Main Event Page gadgets Comment 1 inShare36 Apple Working On Location-Aware Battery Management For iPhone|url=http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/25/apple-working-on-location-aware-battery-management-for-iphone/?ncid=tcdaily|work=[[TechCrunch]]|publisher=[[AOL Inc]]|accessdate=July 25, 2013|author=Darrell Etherington|date=July 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a March 2014 interview, Apple designer [[Jonathan Ive]] used the iPhone as an example of Apple's ethos of creating high-quality, life-changing products. He explained that the phones are comparatively expensive due to the intensive effort that is used to make them:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We don’t take so long and make the way we make for fiscal reasons ... Quite the reverse. The body is made from a single piece of machined aluminium ... The whole thing is polished first to a mirror finish and then is very finely textured, except for the Apple logo. The chamfers [smoothed-off edges] are cut with diamond-tipped cutters. The cutters don’t usually last very long, so we had to figure out a way of mass-manufacturing long-lasting ones. The camera cover is sapphire crystal. Look at the details around the sim-card slot. It’s extraordinary!&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Jonathan Ive Designs Tomorrow|url=http://time.com/jonathan-ive-apple-interview/|work=Time|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=22 March 2014|author=John Arlidge|date=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Apple TV===
{{Main|Apple TV}}
[[File:AppleTV top2.png|thumb|The current generation Apple TV.]]
At the 2007 Macworld conference, Jobs demonstrated the [[Apple TV]] (previously known as the iTV),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2006/sep/12itunes7.html |title=Apple Announces iTunes 7 with Amazing New Features |publisher=Apple.com |date=September 12, 2006 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a set-top video device intended to bridge the sale of content from iTunes with high-definition televisions. The device links up to a user's TV and syncs, either via Wi-Fi or a wired network, with one computer's iTunes library and streams content from an additional four. The Apple TV originally incorporated a 40&amp;nbsp;GB hard drive for storage, included outputs for [[HDMI]] and [[component video]], and played video at a maximum resolution of [[720p]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/01/09appletv.html |title= Apple TV Coming to Your Living Room |publisher=Apple.com |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate= October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 31, 2007, a 160 GB drive was released alongside the existing 40&amp;nbsp;GB model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/05/30appletv.html |title=YouTube Coming to Apple TV |publisher=Apple.com |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A software update released on January 15, 2008 allowed media to be purchased directly from the Apple TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15appletv.html |title=Apple Introduces New Apple TV Software &amp; Lowers Price to $229 |publisher=Apple.com |date=January 15, 2008 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, Apple discontinued the original 40 GB Apple TV and now continues to produce and sell the 160 GB Apple TV. On September 1, 2010, Apple released a completely redesigned Apple TV. The new device is 1/4 the size, runs quieter, and replaces the need for a hard drive with media streaming from any iTunes library on the network along with 8 GB of [[flash memory]] to [[cache (computing)|cache]] media downloaded. Like the iPad and the iPhone, Apple TV runs on an A4 processor. The memory included in the device is half of that in the [[iPhone 4]] at 256 MB; the same as the iPad, iPhone 3GS, third and fourth-generation [[iPod Touch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/29/apple-tv-teardown-reveals-8gb-flash-storage-256mb-ram/|first=Ross |last=Miller|title=Apple TV teardown reveals 8GB flash storage, 256MB RAM, leftover iPad parts|date=September 29, 2010|accessdate=October 31, 2010|publisher=AOL |work=[[Engadget]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101002001956/http://www.engadget.com/2010/09/29/apple-tv-teardown-reveals-8gb-flash-storage-256mb-ram/| archivedate= October 2, 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has HDMI out as the only video out source. Features include access to the iTunes Store to rent movies and TV shows (purchasing has been discontinued), streaming from internet video sources, including YouTube and Netflix, and media streaming from an iTunes library. Apple also reduced the price of the device to $99. A third generation of the device was introduced at an Apple event on March 7, 2012, with new features such as higher resolution (1080p) and a new user interface.

===Apple Watch===
{{Main|Apple Watch}}
The Apple Watch [[smartwatch]] was launched by Cook on September 9, 2014, and is scheduled to be released in early 2015. The wearable device consists of fitness-tracking capabilities that are similar to [[Fitbit]], and must be used in combination with an iPhone to work (only the [[iPhone 5]], or later models, are compatible with the Apple Watch).&lt;ref name=pressrelease&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2014/09/09Apple-Unveils-Apple-Watch-Apples-Most-Personal-Device-Ever.html|title=Press Release - Apple Unveils Apple Watch|publisher=Apple|accessdate=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=applewatchtech&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/watch/technology|title=Apple - Apple Watch - Technology|publisher=Apple|date=|accessdate=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=theverge&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.theverge.com/apple-iphone-iwatch-live-blog|title=The Verge live blog|work=[[The Verge]]|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|date=September 9, 2014|accessdate=September 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software===
{{See also|List of Macintosh software}}
Apple develops its own [[operating system]] to run on Macs, [[OS X]], the latest version being [[OS X Yosemite]] (version 10.10). Apple also independently develops computer software titles for its OS X operating system. Much of the software Apple develops is bundled with its computers. An example of this is the consumer-oriented iLife software package that bundles [[iMovie]], [[iPhoto]] and [[GarageBand]]. For presentation, page layout and word processing, [[iWork]] is available, which includes [[Keynote (presentation software)|Keynote]], [[Pages (iWork)|Pages]], and [[Numbers (software)|Numbers]]. iTunes, [[QuickTime]] media player, and [[Software Update]] are available as free downloads for both OS X and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]].

Apple also offers a range of professional software titles. Their range of server software includes the operating system [[OS X Server]]; [[Apple Remote Desktop]], a remote systems management application; and [[Xsan]], a [[Storage Area Network]] file system. For the professional creative market, there is [[Aperture (software)|Aperture]] for professional [[Raw image format|RAW]]-format [[photo]] processing; [[Final Cut Pro]], a video production suite; [[Logic Pro]], a comprehensive music toolkit; and [[Motion (software)|Motion]], an advanced effects composition program.

Apple also offers online services with [[iCloud]], which provides cloud storage and syncing for a wide range of data, including email, contacts, calendars, photos and documents. It also offers iOS device backup, and is able to integrate directly with third-party apps for even greater functionality. iCloud is the fourth generation of online services provided by Apple, and was preceded by [[MobileMe]], .Mac and iTools, all which met varying degrees of success.

According to Steve Jobs, the company's name was inspired by his visit to an apple farm while on a [[fruitarian]] diet. Jobs thought the name &quot;Apple&quot; was &quot;fun, spirited and not intimidating&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Steve Jobs bio says Apple CEO abhorred 'corrupt' execs|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/story/2011/10/20/steve-jobs-bio.html|accessdate=October 21, 2011|newspaper=CBC News|date=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple's first logo, designed by Ron Wayne, depicts [[Sir Isaac Newton]] sitting under an apple tree. It was almost immediately replaced by [[Rob Janoff]]'s &quot;rainbow Apple&quot;, the now-familiar rainbow-colored silhouette of an apple with a bite taken out of it. Janoff presented Jobs with several different monochromatic themes for the &quot;bitten&quot; logo, and Jobs immediately took a liking to it. However, Jobs insisted that the logo be colorized to humanize the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/news/2003/09/60597|title=Wired News: Apple Doin' the Logo-Motion | date=September 26, 2003 | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zlok.net/blog/2009/03/29/i-invented-the-apple-logo/|title=ZLOK Logo Design Blog: I Invented&amp;nbsp;... the Apple Logo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo was designed with a bite so that it would not be confused with a cherry.&lt;ref name=&quot;creativebits_interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creativebits.org/interview/interview_rob_janoff_designer_apple_logo|title= Interview with Rob Janoff, designer of the Apple logo|first=Ivan|last=Raszl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colored stripes were conceived to make the logo more accessible, and to represent the fact the Apple II could generate graphics in color.&lt;ref name=&quot;creativebits_interview&quot; /&gt; This logo is often erroneously referred to as a tribute to [[Alan Turing]], with the bite mark a reference to [[Alan Turing#Death|his method of suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/logos-that-became-legends-icons-from-the-world-of-advertising-768077.html |title=Logos that became legends: Icons from the world of advertising |location=UK |work=The Independent |accessdate=September 14, 2009 | date=January 4, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091003003651/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/logos-that-became-legends-icons-from-the-world-of-advertising-768077.html| archivedate= October 3, 2009| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://replay.web.archive.org/20050314132032/http://www.unisourcedesign.ca/en/archive_design_technology.html_1.html|title=Archived Interview with Rob Janoff | date=March 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Janoff and Apple deny any homage to Turing in the design of the logo.&lt;ref name=&quot;creativebits_interview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leavitt|first=David|title=The Man Who Knew Too Much; Alan Turing and the invention of the computer|year=2007|page=280|location=Phoenix|isbn=978-0-7538-2200-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 27, 1999&lt;ref name=&quot;web.archive.org&quot;/&gt; (the year following the introduction of the [[iMac G3]]), Apple officially dropped the rainbow scheme and began to use monochromatic logos nearly identical in shape to the previous rainbow incarnation. An [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]]-themed version of the monochrome logo was used from 1999 to 2003, and a glass-themed version was used from 2007 to 2013.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

This resulted in a [[Apple Corps v Apple Computer|series of lawsuits]] and tension between the two companies. These issues ended with settling of their most recent lawsuit in 2007.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Apple's first slogan, &quot;[[Byte]] into an Apple&quot;, was coined in the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Apple Company| work = Operating System Documentation Project| publisher = Operating System Documentation Project| date = December 10, 2007| url = http://www.operating-system.org/betriebssystem/_english/fa-apple.htm| accessdate =August 18, 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080921095608/http://www.operating-system.org/betriebssystem/_english/fa-apple.htm| archivedate= September 21, 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1997 to 2002, the slogan &quot;[[Think Different]]&quot; was used in advertising campaigns, and is still closely associated with Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinspirationroom.com/daily/2005/apple-think-different|title=Apple Think Different Campaign | work=The Inspiration Room Daily|accessdate=August 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple also has slogans for specific product lines&amp;nbsp;— for example, &quot;iThink, therefore iMac&quot; was used in 1998 to promote the iMac,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wap.org/tours/macworldny/ithink.html|title=MacWorld New York: I think, therefore iMac|accessdate=August 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Say hello to iPhone&quot; has been used in iPhone advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://billday.com/2007/06/29/say-hello-to-iphone/|title=BillDay.com &quot; Say hello to iPhone|accessdate=August 13, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080907003704/http://billday.com/2007/06/29/say-hello-to-iphone/| archivedate= September 7, 2008| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Hello&quot; was also used to introduce the original Macintosh, [[Newton (platform)|Newton]], iMac (&quot;hello (again)&quot;), and iPod.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2002/01/49652 IMac: What's in a Design, Anyway?].

From the introduction of the Macintosh in 1984 with the [[1984 (television commercial)|1984 Super Bowl commercial]] to the more modern '[[Get a Mac]]' adverts, Apple has been recognized in for its efforts towards effective advertising and marketing for its products. However, claims made by later campaigns [[Apple Inc. advertising#Criticism|were criticized]], particularly the 2005 Power Mac ads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.devproconnections.com/article/apple/bbb-tells-apple-to-halt-misleading-ads.aspx|title=BBB Tells Apple to Halt Misleading Ads|publisher=DevPro|date=March 29, 2004|accessdate=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3797261.stm|title=Apple Power Mac ads 'misleading' |work=BBC News | date=June 11, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computing.co.uk/vnunet/news/2192019/asa-clears-apple-ads|title=UK watchdog clears Apple ads|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110012153/http://www.computing.co.uk/vnunet/news/2192019/asa-clears-apple-ads|archivedate=January 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple's product commercials gained a lot of attention as a result of their eye-popping graphics and catchy tunes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily News&quot;&gt;Farber, Jim.

In response to a query about the devotion of loyal Apple consumers, Jonathon Ive responded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What people are responding to is much bigger than the object. They are responding to something rare—a group of people who do more than simply make something work, they make the very best products they possibly can. It’s a demonstration against thoughtlessness and carelessness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Corporate affairs==
{{see also|List of mergers and acquisitions by Apple|Braeburn Capital|FileMaker Inc.}}

===Corporate culture===
Apple was one of several highly successful companies founded in the 1970s that bucked the traditional notions of [[corporate culture]]. Jobs often walked around the office barefoot even after Apple became a [[Fortune 500]] company. By the time of the &quot;1984&quot; television commercial, Apple's informal culture had become a key trait that differentiated it from its competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deutschman|first=Alan|title=The once and future Steve Jobs|url=http://www.salon.com/technology/books/2000/10/11/jobs_excerpt/|work=Salon.com|accessdate=November 22, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101202183854/http://www.salon.com/technology/books/2000/10/11/jobs_excerpt/| archivedate= December 2, 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2011 report in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]],'' this has resulted in a corporate culture more akin to a startup rather than a multinational corporation.&lt;ref name=Fortune1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup|title=How Apple works: inside the world's largest startup|last=Lashinsky|first=Adam|publisher=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the company has grown and been led by a series of differently opinionated chief executives, it has arguably lost some of its original character. Nonetheless, it has maintained a reputation for fostering individuality and excellence that reliably attracts talented workers, particularly after Jobs returned to the company. Numerous Apple employees have stated that projects without Jobs's involvement often take longer than projects with it.&lt;ref name=&quot;cultofmacwork&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultofmac.com/what-its-like-to-work-at-apple|title=What It's Like To Work At Apple|first=John|last=Brownlee|date=July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; To recognize the best of its employees, Apple created the Apple Fellows program which awards individuals who make extraordinary technical or leadership contributions to [[personal computing]] while at the company. The Apple Fellowship has so far been awarded to individuals including [[Bill Atkinson]],&lt;ref name=&quot;hertzfeld&quot;&gt;[[Andy Hertzfeld|Hertzfeld, Andy]].

At Apple, employees are specialists who are not exposed to functions outside their area of expertise. Jobs saw this as a means of having &quot;best-in-class&quot; employees in every role. For instance, [[Ron Johnson (businessman)|Ron Johnson]]—Senior Vice President of Retail Operations until November 1, 2011—was responsible for site selection, in-store service, and store layout, yet had no control of the inventory in his stores (this was done by Cook, who had a background in supply-chain management).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Lashinsky |first=Adam |url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/25/how-apple-works-inside-the-worlds-biggest-startup/ |title=How Apple works: Inside the world's biggest startup – Fortune Tech |publisher=Tech.fortune.cnn.com |accessdate=December 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; Apple is also known for strictly enforcing accountability. Each project has a &quot;directly responsible individual,&quot; or &quot;DRI&quot; in Apple jargon.&lt;ref name=Fortune1/&gt; As an example, when iOS senior vice president [[Scott Forstall]] refused to sign Apple's official apology for numerous errors in the redesigned [[Apple Maps|Maps app]], he was forced to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lashinsky|first=Adam|title=Inside Apple's major shakeup|url=http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/10/29/inside-apples-major-shakeup/|work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=October 29, 2012|accessdate=December 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other major U.S. companies Apple provides a relatively simple compensation policy for executives that does not include perks enjoyed by other CEOs like country club fees or private use of company aircraft. The company typically grants stock options to executives every other year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/apple-ceo-gets-modest-2012-pay-after-huge-2011-1.1092906|title=Apple CEO gets modest 2012 pay after huge 2011|date=December 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Customer service===
In 1999 Apple retained Eight Inc. as a strategic retail design partner and began creating the Apple retail stores. Tim Kobe of Eight Inc.  prepared an &quot;Apple Retail&quot; white paper for Jobs, outlining the ability of separate Apple retail stores to directly drive the Apple brand experience—Kobe used their recently completed work with The North Face and Nike as a basis for the white paper.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The first two Apple Stores opened on May 19, 2001 in Tysons Corner, Virginia, and [[Glendale, California]].

The advisors earn between US$9 and $12 per hour and receive intensive management to ensure a high quality of customer support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Apple Gets At-Home Workers To Work|url=http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/28/how-apple-gets-at-home-workers-to-work/?ncid=tcdaily|work=TechCrunch|publisher=AOL Inc|accessdate=July 29, 2013|author=Ashley Verrill|date=July 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacturing===
The company's manufacturing, procurement and logistics enable it to execute massive product launches without having to maintain large, profit-sapping inventories. In 2011, Apple's profit margins were 40 percent, compared with between 10 and 20 percent for most other hardware companies. Cook's catchphrase to describe his focus on the company's operational arm is: “Nobody wants to buy sour milk”.&lt;ref name=supply/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.financialpost.com/2011/11/09/ruthlessness-and-lasers-apples-supply-chain-revealed/ |title=Ruthlessness and lasers: Apple's supply chain revealed &amp;#124; Smart Shift &amp;#124; Executive &amp;#124; Financial Post |publisher=Business.financialpost.com |accessdate=December 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Mac's early history Apple generally refused to adopt prevailing industry standards for hardware, instead creating their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawlor.cs.uaf.edu/~olawlor/ref/mac_ports/index.html |title=Mac Ports |publisher=Lawlor.cs.uaf.edu |date=March 17, 2001 |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend was largely reversed in the late 1990s, beginning with Apple's adoption of the [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] bus in the [[Power Macintosh 7500|7500]]/[[Power Macintosh 8500|8500]]/[[Power Macintosh 9500|9500]] [[Power Macintosh|Power Macs]]. Apple has since adopted [[USB]], [[AGP]], [[HyperTransport]], [[Wi-Fi]], and other industry standards in its computers. [[FireWire]] is an Apple-originated standard that was widely adopted across the industry after it was standardized as [[IEEE 1394]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1394ta.org/consumers/WhatIsFireWire.html|title=1394 Trade Association: What is 1394?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{further|Criticism of Apple Inc.#Labor practices}}
The company advertised its products as being made in America until the late 1990s; however, as a result of [[outsourcing]] initiatives in the 2000s, almost all of its manufacturing is now handled abroad. According to a report by the ''[[New York Times]]'', Apple insiders &quot;believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the flexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their American counterparts that “Made in the U.S.A.” is no longer a viable option for most Apple products&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first1=Charles | last1=Duhigg | first2=Keith | last2=Bradsher | title=Apple, America and a Squeezed Middle Class | date=January 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the ''[[Mail on Sunday]]'' reported on the working conditions of the Chinese factories where contract manufacturers [[Foxconn]] and [[Inventec]] produced the iPod.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.mailonsunday.co.uk/news/article-401234/The-stark-reality-iPods-Chinese-factories.html |title=The Stark Reality of iPod's Chinese Factories |work=Daily Mail |location=UK |date=August 18, 2006 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article stated that one complex of factories that assembled the iPod and other items had over 200,000 workers living and working within it.

A little over half of the workers' earnings was required to pay for rent and food from the company.&lt;ref name=&quot;wpsweatshop&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Musgrove |first=Mike |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/15/AR2006061501898.html |title=Sweatshop Conditions at IPod Factory Reported |work=The Washington Post |date=June 16, 2006 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kahney |first=Leander |url=http://www.wired.com/gadgets/mac/commentary/cultofmac/2006/06/71138 |title=Judging Apple Sweatshop Charge |publisher=Wired |date=June 13, 2006 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dean |url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB118677584137994489.html?mod=blog |title=The Forbidden City of Terry Gou |work=The Wall Street Journal|date=November 2, 2010 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;|publisher=Wired|accessdate=November 13, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101104233204/http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/11/foxconn-photo-gallery/?pid=731&amp;viewall=true| archivedate= November 4, 2010| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Foxconn suicides]] occurred between January and November 2010, when 18&lt;ref name=tian&gt;{{cite news | title=Struggle for Foxconn girl who wanted to die | work=South China Morning Post | date=15 December 2010 | accessdate=10 June 2012 | author=Lau, Mimi | location=Wuhan, Hubei}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Foxconn]] (Chinese: 富士康) employees attempted [[suicide]], resulting in 14 deaths—the company was the world’s largest contract electronics manufacturer, for clients including Apple, at the time.&lt;ref name=tian/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;scmpreport&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Foxconn factories are labour camps: report | work=South China Morning Post | date=11 October 2010 | accessdate=10 June 2012 | author=Tam, Fiona}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6A41M920101105|title=Foxconn worker plunges to death at China plant: report|publisher=Reuters|date=5 Nov 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- 6:05&amp;nbsp;am EDT --&gt; The suicides drew media attention, and employment practices at Foxconn were investigated by Apple.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ-Foxconn&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704026204575267603576594936.html|title=Apple, H-P to Examine Asian Supplier After String of Deaths at Factory|author=Jason Dean|date=27 May 2010|accessdate=29 May 2010|work=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple issued a public statement about the suicides, and company spokesperson Steven Dowling said: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;

A team from Apple is independently evaluating the steps they are taking to address these tragic events and we will continue our ongoing inspections of the facilities where our products are made.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huff&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author1=William Foreman|title=Tech: Apple Supplier Foxconn Suffers 10th Death This Year, Asks Workers To Sign Anti-Suicide Pledge|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/05/25/foxconn-suffers-10th-deat_n_588524.html|accessdate=20 December 2014|work=The Huffington Post|date=26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The statement was released after the results from the company's probe into its suppliers' labor practices were published in early 2010. Foxconn was not specifically named in the report, but Apple identified a series of serious labor violations of labor laws, including Apple's own rules, and some child labor existed in a number of factories.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huff&quot; /&gt; Apple committed to the implementation of changes following the suicides.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fire&quot; /&gt;

Also in 2010, workers in China planned to sue iPhone contractors over poisoning by a cleaner used to clean LCD screens. One worker claimed that he and his coworkers had not been informed of possible occupational illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/05/wintek-employees-sue/ |title=Workers Plan to Sue iPhone Contractor Over Poisoning |first=Brian X. |last=Chen |date=May 14, 2010 |publisher=Wired |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!-- None --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a high suicide rate in a Foxconn facility in China making iPads and iPhones, albeit a lower rate than that of China as a whole,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16231588|title=Suicides at Foxconn: Light and death|publisher=Economist|date=May 27, 2010|accessdate=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; workers were forced to sign a legally binding document guaranteeing that they would not kill themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1285980/Revealed-Inside-Chinese-suicide-sweatshop-workers-toil-34-hour-shifts-make-iPod.html |title=Revealed: Inside the Chinese suicide sweatshop where workers toil in 34-hour shifts to make your iPod &amp;#124; Mail Online |work=Daily Mail |location=London |date=December 6, 2010 |accessdate=October 7, 2011 |first1=Andrew |last1=Malone |first2=Richard |last2=Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; Workers in factories producing Apple products have also been exposed to n-[[hexane]], a [[neurotoxin]] that is a cheaper alternative than alcohol for cleaning the products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/10/26/3048024.htm Workers poisoned while making iPhones] ABC News, October 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/foreign/content/2010/s3044840.htm Dirty Secrets] ABC Foreign Correspondent, 2010-Oct-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/healthguidelines/n-hexane/recognition.html Occupational Safety and Health Guideline for n-Hexane], OSHA.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[China Labor Watch]] said it found violations of the law and of Apple's working condition pledges at facilities operated by [[Pegatron]]. These violations included discrimination against ethnic minorities and women, withholding of employee pay, excessive work hours, poor living conditions, health and safety problems and pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/29/apple-supplier-accused-of-labor-abuses_n_3669526.html?ncid=txtlnkushpmg00000029 Apple Supplier Accused Of Labor Abuses By China Watchdog (VIDEO)] ''[[The Huffington Post]]''. Retrieved July 29, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 BBC investigation found excessive hours and other problems persisted, despite Apple's promise to reform factory practice after the 2010 Foxconn suicides. The Pegatron factory was once again the subject of review, as reporters gained access to the working conditions inside through recruitment as employees. While the BBC maintained that the experiences of its reporters showed that labor violations were continuing since 2010, Apple publicly disagreed with the BBC and stated: “We are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fire&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Apple under fire again for working conditions at Chinese factories|url=http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/dec/19/apple-under-fire-again-for-working-conditions-at-chinese-factories?CMP=EMCNEWEML6619I2|accessdate=20 December 2014|work=The Guardian|date=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, the [[Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights]] published a report which documented inhumane conditions for the 15,000 workers at a [[Zhen Ding Technology]] factory in Shenzhen, China, which serves as a major supplier of circuit boards for Apple's iPhone and iPad. According to the report, workers are pressured into 65 hour work weeks which leaves them so exhausted that they often sleep during lunch breaks. They are also made to reside in &quot;primitive, dark and filthy dorms&quot; where they sleep &quot;on plywood, with six to ten workers in each crowded room.&quot; Omnipresent security personnel also routinely harass and beat the workers.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Jamieson (December 23, 2014).

In 2010, [[Climate Counts]], a nonprofit organization dedicated to directing consumers toward the greenest companies, gave Apple a score of 52 points out of a possible 100, which puts Apple in their top category &quot;Striding&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatecounts.org/scorecard_score.php?co=7 |title=Climate Counts scorecard |publisher=Climatecounts.org |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was an increase from May 2008, when Climate Counts only gave Apple 11 points out of 100, which placed the company last among electronics companies, at which time Climate Counts also labeled Apple with a &quot;stuck icon&quot;, adding that Apple at the time was &quot;a choice to avoid for the climate conscious consumer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;iwclimate&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/hardware/mac/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207601672|title=Environmental Group Hits Apple}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the guide criticizes Apple on the Energy criteria for not seeking external verification of its greenhouse gas emissions data and for not setting out any targets to reduce emissions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guide to Greener Electronics&quot; /&gt; In January 2012, Apple requested that their cable maker, Volex, begin producing halogen-free USB and power cables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Ash|title=Apple Power Cables to Become Even More Environmentally Friendly|url=http://www.keynoodle.com/apple-power-cables-to-become-even-more-environmentally-friendly/|publisher=KeyNoodle|accessdate=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple has created subsidiaries in low-tax places such as the [[Republic of Ireland]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[British Virgin Islands]] to cut the taxes it pays around the world. According to the ''New York Times,'' in the 1980s Apple was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed the company to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes. In the late 1980s Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the &quot;[[Double Irish arrangement#Dutch sandwich|Double Irish With a Dutch Sandwich]],&quot; which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;Duhigg, Charles (April 29, 2012)[ &quot;How Apple Sidesteps Billions in Taxes.&quot;] ''New York Times.'' (Retrieved 4-20-12.)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[British Conservative Party]] Member of Parliament [[Charlie Elphicke]] published research on October 30, 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Watson|first=Roland|title=Foreign companies 'avoid billions in corporation tax'|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/politics/article3583772.ece|newspaper=The Times|date=October 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which showed that some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard [[corporation tax]]. He followed this research by calling on the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[George Osborne]] to force these multinationals, which also included [[Google]] and [[The Coca-Cola Company]], to state the effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not pay their fair share of UK tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ebrahimi|first=Helia|title=Foreign firms could owe UK £11bn in unpaid taxes|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/consumertips/tax/9652516/Foreign-firms-could-owe-UK-11bn-in-unpaid-taxes.html|newspaper=Telegraph|date=November 2, 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2014 the [[European Commissioner for Competition]] launched an investigation of Apple's tax practices in [[Ireland]], as part of a wider probe of multi-national companies' tax arrangements in various European countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECprobe&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=European Commission to probe tax affairs of Apple, Starbucks and Fiat|url=http://www.europesun.com/index.php/sid/222816605/scat/baf10b3527f6df38/ht/European-Commission-to-probe-tax-affairs-of-Apple-Starbucks-and-Fiat|accessdate=June 12, 2014|publisher=Europe Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[Luxembourg Leaks]], Apple has been revealed to use the Luxembourg tax haven for tax avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/2014/11/06/luxembourg-s-attractive-company-tax-leaks-tempt-scandal/|title=Luxembourg’s attractive company tax leaks tempt scandal|work=euronews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Litigation===
{{main|Apple Inc. litigation}}
Apple has been a participant in various legal proceedings and claims since it began operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Court Cases Involving Apple, Inc.|url=https://www.docketalarm.com/cases/AllNaturesOfSuit/Apple%2C%20Inc./|publisher=Docket Alarm, Inc.|accessdate=May 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Apple is known for and promotes itself as actively and aggressively enforcing its intellectual property interests. Some litigation examples include ''[[Apple v. Samsung]]'', ''[[Apple v. Microsoft]]'', ''[[Motorola Mobility v. Apple Inc.]]'', and ''[[Apple Corps v. Apple Computer]]''.

===Charitable causes===
As of 2014, Apple is listed as a partner of the [[Product RED]] campaign. The campaign's mission is to prevent the transmission of [[HIV]] from mother to child by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=(RED) Partners|url=http://www.joinred.com/aboutred/red-partners/|work=(RED)|publisher=(RED), a division of The ONE Campaign|accessdate=October 13, 2012|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2012, Apple donated $2.5 million to the [[American Red Cross]] to aid relief efforts after [[Hurricane Sandy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weintraub|first=Seth|title=Apple donates $2.5M to Hurricane Sandy relief|url=http://9to5mac.com/2012/11/09/apple-donates-2-5-million-to-hurricane-sandy-relief/|publisher=9to5Mac|accessdate=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
