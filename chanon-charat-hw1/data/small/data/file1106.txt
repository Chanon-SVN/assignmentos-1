*The second son of [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] ([[Books of Samuel|1 Samuel]] 8:2; 1 Chr. 6:28). His conduct, along with that of his brother, as a judge in [[Beer-sheba]], to which office his father had appointed him, led to popular discontent, and ultimately provoked the people to demand a [[monarchy]].
*A descendant of [[Eleazar]], the son of [[Aaron]], a chief of one of the twenty-four orders into which the priesthood was divided by [[David (biblical king)|David]] (1 Chr. 24:10). The order of Abijah was one of those that did not return from the Captivity ([[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] 2:36–39; [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] 7:39–42; 12:1).
*A son of [[Jeroboam]], the first king of Israel. On account of his severe illness when a youth, his father sent his wife to consult the prophet [[Ahijah the Shilonite|Ahijah]] regarding his recovery. The prophet, though blind with old age, knew the wife of Jeroboam as soon as she approached, and under a divine impulse he announced to her that inasmuch as in Abijah alone of all the house of Jeroboam there was found &quot;some good thing toward the Lord&quot;, he only would come to his grave in peace. As his mother crossed the threshold of the door on her return, the youth died, and &quot;all Israel mourned for him&quot; ([[Books of Kings|1 Kings]] 14:1–18).
