'''American Airlines, Inc.''' ('''AA''') is a major [[United States]] airline. It operates an extensive international and U.S. domestic network, with scheduled flights throughout North America, the Caribbean, South America, Europe, and Asia. Its route network centers on five hubs at [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas/Fort Worth]], [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York]], [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]], [[Miami International Airport|Miami]], and [[O'Hare International Airport|O'Hare International Airport in Chicago]]. Its primary maintenance base is located at [[Tulsa International Airport]] (TUL). The company is headquartered in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], [[Texas]].

American Airlines is a member airline of the [[Oneworld]] airline alliance, and coordinates fares, services, and scheduling with [[British Airways]], [[Finnair]], and [[Iberia (airline)|Iberia]] in the transatlantic market and with [[Japan Airlines]] and [[Qantas]] in the transpacific market.

[[File:American DC-3.jpg|thumb|left|DC-3 &quot;Flagship&quot;, American's chief aircraft type during the World War II period]]
In 1934 American Airways Company was acquired by [[Errett Lobban Cord|E.&amp;nbsp;L. Cord]], who renamed it &quot;American Air Lines&quot;. Cord hired Texas businessman [[C. R. Smith]] to run the company. Smith worked with [[Donald Wills Douglas, Sr.|Donald Douglas]] to develop the [[Douglas DC-3|DC-3]], which American Airlines was first to fly, in 1936. American's DC-3 made it the first airline to be able to operate a route that could earn a profit solely by transporting passengers; other carriers could not earn a profit without U.S. Mail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/american-blemish-distinguished-history-222159291.html &quot;For American, a blemish on a distinguished history,&quot; [[Associated Press]] story, published on Yahoo! news online, 29 November 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; With the DC-3, American began calling its aircraft &quot;[[Flagships]]&quot; and establishing the Admirals Club for valued passengers. The DC-3s had a four-star &quot;admiral's pennant&quot; outside the cockpit window while the aircraft was parked. American operated daily overnight transcontinental service between New York and Los Angeles through Dallas/Fort Worth and other intermediate stops, advertising the service as an &quot;all-year southern route.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1938 - August 5 - American Airlines Timetables, Route Maps, and History|url=http://airchive.com/html/timetable-and-route-maps/american-airlines-timetables-route-maps-and-history/1938-august-5-american-airlines-timetables-route-maps-and-history/4710|publisher=Airchive|accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American Airlines was the first to cooperate with [[Fiorello H. La Guardia|Fiorello LaGuardia]] to build an airport in New York City,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} and became owner of the world's first [[Airport lounge|airline lounge]] at the new [[LaGuardia Airport]] (LGA), known as the [[Admirals Club]].

After World War II American acquired American Export Airlines, renaming it as [[American Overseas Airways]], to serve Europe. AOA was sold to [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] in 1950. AA launched another subsidiary, American Airlines de Mexico S.A., to fly to Mexico and built several airports there.

American Airlines ordered British-built [[De Havilland Comet]]s; the orders were cancelled when the Comets were found to suffer serious metal fatigue. American Airlines introduced transcontinental [[Boeing 707]]s on 25 January 1959 and invested $440&amp;nbsp;million in jet aircraft up to 1962;{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} launched the first electronic booking system, [[Sabre (computer system)|Sabre]], with [[IBM]] (the basis of today's [[Travelocity]]); and built a terminal at Idlewild (now [[John F.

American opened a second hub in the new Terminal 3 at Chicago O'Hare in 1982, and began transatlantic service between Dallas and London in May 1982.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Led by its new chairman and CEO, [[Robert Crandall]], American expanded its service from these hubs through the 1980s, adding service to other European destinations as well as Japan.

In the late 1980s, American Airlines opened three hubs for north-south traffic. [[Norman Y. Mineta San José International Airport|San Jose International Airport]] was added after American purchased [[AirCal]]. American built a terminal and runway at [[Raleigh-Durham International Airport]] for the growing [[Research Triangle Park]] nearby,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} and to compete with [[US Airways|USAir]]'s hub in [[Charlotte/Douglas International Airport]]. [[Nashville International Airport]] was also added as a hub. American also planned a north-south hub at [[Stapleton International Airport]] in Denver during the mid-1980s, but postponed those plans due to the planned development of [[Denver International Airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Washburn|first=Gary|title=American Airlines Plans Nashville Hub |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-06-06/business/8502050708_1_chicago-and-dallas-ft-american-airlines-nashville-metropolitan-airport|accessdate=December 9, 2013|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=June 6, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, American Airlines bought the assets of TWA's operations at London Heathrow for $445&amp;nbsp;million. Until [[open skies]] came into effect in April 2008, American Airlines and [[United Airlines]] were the only U.S. carriers permitted to serve Heathrow.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Lower fuel prices and a favorable{{vague|date=December 2013}} business climate led to higher profits in the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The industry's expansion was not lost on pilots who on February 17, 1997 went on strike for higher wages. President [[Bill Clinton]] invoked the [[Railway Labor Act]] citing economic impact to the United States, quashing the strike.&lt;ref name=&quot;strike&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=American Airlines Resuming Service After Clinton Stops Strike |last=Knowlton |first=Brian |work=International Herald Tribune |url= http://www.iht.com/articles/1997/02/17/fly.t_1.php |date=February 17, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pilots settled for wages lower than their demands.

The three new hubs were abandoned in the 1990s: some San Jose facilities were sold to [[Reno Air]], and at Raleigh/Durham to [[Midway Airlines (1993–2003)|Midway Airlines]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Midway went out of business in 2001. American Airlines purchased Reno Air in February 1999 and integrated its operations on 31 August 1999,{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} but did not resume hub operations in San Jose. American discontinued most of Reno Air's routes, and sold most of the Reno Air aircraft, as it did with [[Air California]] 12 years earlier. The only remaining route from the [[Air California]] and Reno Air purchases is from San Francisco to Los Angeles.

During this time concern over airline bankruptcies and falling stock prices brought a warning from American's CEO [[Robert Crandall]]. &quot;I've never invested in any airline&quot;, Crandall said. &quot;I'm an airline manager. I don't invest in airlines. And I always said to the employees of American, 'This is not an appropriate investment. It's a great place to work and it's a great company that does important work. But airlines are not an investment.'&quot; Crandall noted that since [[airline deregulation]] of the 1970s, 150 airlines had gone out of business. &quot;A lot of people came into the airline business. Most of them promptly exited, minus their money&quot;, he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside American Airlines, A Week in the Life|url=http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=1193494763|publisher=CNBC|accessdate= August 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Miami International Airport]] became a hub after American Airlines bought Central and South American routes (&quot;El Interamericano&quot;) from [[Eastern Air Lines]] in 1990 (inherited from [[Braniff International Airways]] but originated by [[Pan American-Grace Airways]] which was known as [[Pan American-Grace Airways|Panagra]]). Through the 1990s, American Airlines expanded its network in Latin America to become the dominant U.S. carrier in the region.

On October 15, 1998, American Airlines became the first airline to offer electronic ticketing in the 44 countries it serves.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In 1999, American Airlines, [[British Airways]], [[Cathay Pacific]], [[Canadian Airlines]], and [[Qantas]] founded the global airline alliance [[Oneworld]].

===2000s===
Robert Crandall left in 1998 and was replaced by [[Donald J. Carty]], who negotiated the purchase of the near bankrupt [[Trans World Airlines]] (it would file for its third bankruptcy as part of the purchase agreement)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/29/business/twa-cleared-for-2d-bankruptcy-filing.html |work=The New York Times |title=T.W.A.

American Airlines began losing money in the economic downturn that followed the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], which destroyed two of its planes. Carty negotiated wage and benefit agreements with the unions but resigned after union leaders discovered he was planning to award [[executive compensation]] packages at the same time.

===Labor unions===
{{Refimprove|date=August 2014}}
* The [[Allied Pilots Association]] (APA) is an in-house union which represents the 12,000 American Airlines pilots; it was created in 1963 after the pilots left the [[Air Line Pilots Association]] (ALPA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliedpilots.org/Public/AboutAPA/Background/background.asp About the Allied Pilots Association].

* The [[Transport Workers Union of America|Transport Workers Union]] (TWU) represents many American Airlines and American Eagle ground staff, including fleet service clerks, dispatchers, ground school instructors, technicians, mechanics, and stores personnel.
* American's passenger service employees are not unionized, but there have been efforts to bring them under [[Communications Workers of America]] representation, most recently in a [[National Mediation Board]]-authorized election in January 2013 in which the employees voted to remain independent.

ALPA, AFA, and TWU are affiliated with [[AFL-CIO]], while APA and APFA are not.

===Environmental record===
Violations occurring over a 4½ year period – from October 1993 to July 1998 – targeted American Airlines for using high-sulfur fuel in motor vehicles at 10 major airports around the country. Under the federal [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] high sulfur fuel cannot be used in motor vehicles. American Airlines promptly identified and corrected these violations of the Clean Air Act.&lt;ref name=&quot;epa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=American Airines Will Make Clean Air Improvements at Logan Airport Reports to EPA the Use of Illegal High Sulfur Fuel in Motor Vehicles|url=http://epa.gov/NE/pr/1999/072099b.html |work=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=July 19, 1999|accessdate=January 25, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American Airlines' wastewater treatment plant [[recycle]]s water used at the base to wash aircraft, process rinse water tanks, and irrigate landscape. That alone has saved almost $1&amp;nbsp;million since 2002. In addition to that, American Airlines has also won the award for the reduction of [[hazardous waste]] that saved them $229,000 after a $2,000 investment. A bar code system is used to track hazardous waste. It has led to reduction of waste by 50 percent since 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;envqual&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0CWU/is_2006_May_11/ai_n16359869|title=American Airlines Receives Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's Governor's Award |work=Airline Industry Information |date=May 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate identity===

====Logo====
[[File:American Airlines logo.svg|thumb||American Airlines' former logo, in use from 1967 until 2013]]
In 1967, [[Massimo Vignelli]] designed the famous AA logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vignelli.com/home/identity/aa.html |title=Vignelli Associates About the AA Logo |publisher=Vignelli.com |accessdate= December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logosdesigners.com/#massimo-vignelli Iconic Logo Designers]&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty years later, in 1997, American Airlines was able to make its logo Internet-compatible by buying the domain AA.com. ''AA'' is also American's two-letter [[IATA]] [[airline codes|airline designator]].

On January 16, 2013, American launched a new rebranding and marketing campaign with FutureBrand dubbed, &quot;A New American&quot;. This included a new logo replacing the classic 1967 logo. American Airlines calls the new logo the &quot;Flight Symbol&quot;, incorporating the eagle, star, and &quot;A&quot; of the classic logo.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aa.com/newamerican?anchorLocation=HomePageHero1&amp;reportedTitle=Becoming%20a%20new%20American&amp;reportedPosition=0&amp;url=undefined&amp;_locale=en_US&amp;repositoryName=undefined&amp;repositoryId=undefined |title=Becoming a new American |publisher=aa.com |date= |accessdate=March 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Livery====
American's early [[aircraft livery|liveries]] varied widely, but a common livery was adopted in the 1930s, featuring an [[eagle]] painted on the fuselage. The eagle became a symbol of the company and inspired the name of [[Envoy Air|American Eagle Airlines]]. Propeller aircraft featured an [[international orange]] lightning bolt running down the length of the fuselage, which was replaced by a simpler orange stripe with the introduction of jets.

[[File:American Airlines Astrojet N951AA.jpg|thumb|A Boeing 737 in the Astrojet livery]]

In the late 1960s, American commissioned designer [[Massimo Vignelli]] to develop a new livery. The original design called for a red, white, and blue stripe on the fuselage, and a simple &quot;AA&quot; logo, without an eagle, on the tail; instead, Vignelli created a highly stylized eagle, which remained the company's logo until 2013. In 1999, American painted a new [[Boeing 757]] (N679AN) in its 1959 international orange livery. One [[Boeing 777]] and one Boeing 757 were painted in standard livery with a pink ribbon on the sides and on the tail, in support for the [[Susan G. Komen for the Cure]]. One Boeing 757 is painted with a yellow ribbon on the tailfin on the aircraft and on the side of the body says &quot;Flagship Independence&quot;. American Eagle, the airline's regional airline has the same special livery on ERJ-145 aircraft.

[[File:AA Flagship Freedom.JPG|thumb|left|AA &quot;Flagship Freedom&quot;, labeled with a &quot;[[Yellow ribbon|yellow awareness ribbon]]&quot; symbol, representing support of the [[United States Armed Forces]] overseas operations.]]
On January 17, 2013, American unveiled a new livery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/breaking/chi-american-airlines-livery-20130117,0,198977.story |title=American Airlines unveils new logo, livery |work=Chicago Tribune |date=January 17, 2013 |accessdate=January 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before then, American had been the only major U.S. airline to leave most of its aircraft surfaces unpainted. This was because C. R. Smith hated painted aircraft, and refused to use any liveries that involved painting the entire plane. Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Crandall later justified the distinctive natural metal finish by noting that less paint reduced the aircraft's weight, thus saving on fuel costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://industry.bnet.com/travel/1000148/paint-vs-bare-metal-on-airplanes/ |title=Delta, Air Canada Among Carriers Weighing Benefit of Paint Stripping |publisher=Industry.bnet.com |date=8 October 2008 |accessdate=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, American launched a new rebranding and marketing campaign dubbed, &quot;A New American&quot;. In addition to a new logo, American Airlines introduced a new livery for all aircraft in the fleet. The airline calls the new livery and branding &quot;a clean and modern update&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; The current design features an abstract American flag on the tail, along with a silver-painted fuselage, as a throw-back to the old livery.

{{main|AAdvantage}}
AAdvantage is the frequent flyer program of American Airlines. Launched May 1, 1981, it was the second such [[loyalty program]] in the world (after the first at [[Texas International Airlines]] in 1979), and remains the largest with more than 67 million members as of October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thetravelinsider.info/airlinemismanagement/airlinederegulation2.htm |title=A History of US Airline Deregulation Part 4: 1979 – 2010: The Effects of Deregulation – Lower Fares, More Travel, Frequent Flier Programs |first=David M. |last= Rowell |date=August 13, 2010 |publisher=The Travel Insider |accessdate=September 21, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100816114115/http://www.thetravelinsider.info/airlinemismanagement/airlinederegulation2.htm| archivedate= 16 August 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=American Airlines|title=American Airlines AAdvantage Program Details |url=https://www.aa.com/aa/i18nForward.do?p=/AAdvantage/programDetails/main.jsp&amp;anchorEvent=false|accessdate=May 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American Airlines serves four continents, trailing [[Delta Air Lines]] and [[United Airlines]], which both serve six. Hubs at Dallas/Fort Worth and Miami serve as gateways to the Americas, while American's Chicago hub has become the airline's primary gateway to Europe and Asia. New York Kennedy (JFK) is a primary gateway for both the Americas and Europe, while the Los Angeles hub (LAX) is the primary gateway to Asia. [[Lambert-St. Louis International Airport]] served as a regional hub for several years. However, the airline's 2009 restructuring led to the airport being removed as a [[focus city]] on April 5, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/travel/flights/item.aspx?type=blog&amp;ak=68499380.blog |title=Aviation Photos &amp; Video |work=USA Today | first=Ben |last=Mutzabaugh}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., American serves the third-largest number of international destinations, after [[United Airlines]] and [[Delta Air Lines]].

American also operated interchange flight services in conjunction with Alaska Airlines during the 1970s between Texas and Alaska during the construction of the Trans-Alaska oil pipeline. This interchange agreement allowed for single, no change of aircraft service between Houston, Texas and Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, and Anchorage, Alaska and Fairbanks, Alaska. The round trip routing of this interchange flight was Houston-Dallas/Fort Worth-Seattle-Anchorage-Fairbanks with Seattle, Washington serving as the interchange point where flight and cabin crews were changed from one airline to the other. Boeing 727-200 jetliners provided by both American and Alaska Airlines were utilized to provide this interchange service.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Admirals Club===
[[File:Admirals Club logo.png|thumb|Admirals Club logo]]
The Admirals Club was conceived by AA president C.R. Smith as a marketing promotion shortly after he was made an honorary [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]]. Inspired by the [[Kentucky colonel]]s and other [[Title of honor|honorary]] organizations, Smith decided to make particularly valued passengers &quot;admirals&quot; of the &quot;Flagship fleet&quot; (AA called its aircraft &quot;Flagships&quot; at the time). The list of Admirals included many celebrities, politicians, and other VIPs, as well as more &quot;ordinary&quot; customers who had been particularly loyal to the airline.

There was no physical Admirals Club until shortly after the opening of LaGuardia Airport. During the airport's construction, New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia had an upper-level lounge set aside for press conferences and business meetings. At one such press conference, he noted that the entire terminal was being offered for lease to airline tenants; after a reporter asked whether the lounge would be leased as well, LaGuardia replied that it would, and a vice president of AA immediately offered to lease the premises. The airline then procured a liquor license and began operating the lounge as the &quot;Admirals Club&quot; in 1939.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

The second Admirals Club opened at Washington National Airport. Because it was illegal to sell alcohol in Virginia at the time, the club contained refrigerators for the use of its members, so they could store their own liquor at the airport.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} For many years, membership in the Admirals Club (and most other airline lounges) was by the airline's invitation. After a passenger sued for discrimination,&lt;ref name=&quot;timeac&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Toward Equality for VIPs|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,836046,00.html?iid=chix-sphere|work=TIME|date=July 15, 1966|accessdate=January 26, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090114112519/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,836046,00.html?iid=chix-sphere| archivedate= January 14, 2014 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Club (and most other airline lounges) switched to a paid membership program.

===Flagship Lounge===
Though affiliated with the Admirals Club and staffed by many of the same employees, the Flagship Lounge is a separate lounge specifically designed for customers flying in First Class on transcontinental domestic flights and international flights, as well as AAdvantage Executive Platinum and Oneworld Emerald frequent flyers.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}  Flagship Lounges are now available at four airports: Chicago-O'Hare, London-Heathrow, Los Angeles, and New York-JFK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flagship Lounge(R)|url=http://www.aa.com/i18n/travelInformation/airportAmenities/AAFlagshipLounges.jsp|publisher=American Airlines |accessdate=December 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; American also previously offered a Flagship Lounge in Miami from 2000 to 2002, and again from 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesstraveller.com/news/aa-lounge-opens-at-miami-international |title=AA lounge opens at Miami International |publisher=Business Traveller |date=February 16, 2009 |accessdate=January 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accidents and incidents==
{{Main|American Airlines accidents and incidents}}
More than 50 American Airlines flights have crashed or been involved in incidents with fatalities. The most recent crash involving fatalities was [[American Airlines Flight 587]] in New York on November 12, 2001.

==In popular culture==
In the 1960s, [[Mattel]] released a series of ''American Airlines stewardess'' [[Barbie]] dolls.

In December 1990, 1992 and 1997, American Airlines was featured in [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]]' [[Home Alone]] trilogy

American Airlines was extensively featured in the 2009 movie [[Up in the Air (2009 film)|Up in the Air]] as part of a marketing tie-in between the airline and [[Paramount Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/21/business/media/21adco.html | publisher=The New York Times | title=A Dream for an Airline and a Hotel Chain | author=Andrew Adam Newman | date=December 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; American Airlines is the preferred airline of protagonist Ryan Bingham ([[George Clooney]]).  A significant plot point includes Ryan's quest to reach the ten-million-miler level of the [[AAdvantage]] frequent flier program.  Many of the airport scenes were filmed in unused yet still branded AA terminal space at [[Lambert–St. Louis International Airport|Lambert Airport]], and all of the airplane scenes were filmed in borrowed AA airplanes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1193138/ Up in the Air (2009)]. IMDB.com.  Retrieved on September 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, American Airlines collaborated with [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] to promote [[Planes (film)|Planes]] by featuring a cameo appearance of a passenger airliner named Tripp, with the new American Airlines Livery to promote its new image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toonbarn.com/toonbarn-tv/disney-collaborates-american-airlines-planes/ Disney Collaborates With American Airlines for PLANES].
