The '''Rockwell''' (now part of [[Boeing]]) '''B-1 Lancer'''&lt;ref group=N&gt;The name &quot;Lancer&quot; is only applied to the B-1B version, after the program was revived.&lt;/ref&gt; is a four-engine supersonic [[variable-sweep wing]], [[turbofan|jet-powered]] [[strategic bomber]] used by the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF). It was first envisioned in the 1960s as a [[supersonic]] bomber with [[Mach number|Mach]] 2 speed, and sufficient [[Range (aircraft)|range]] and payload to replace the [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]]. It was developed into the B-1B, primarily a low-level penetrator with long range and Mach 1.25 speed capability at high altitude.

Designed by [[Rockwell International]], development was delayed multiple times over its history, as the theory of strategic balance changed from [[flexible response]] to [[massive retaliation]] and back again. Each change in stance changed the perceived need for manned bombers. The initial B-1A version was developed in the early 1970s, but its production was canceled, and only four prototypes were built. The need for a new platform once again surfaced in the early 1980s, and the aircraft resurfaced as the B-1B version with the focus on low-level penetration bombing. However, by this point development of [[stealth technology]] was promising an aircraft of dramatically improved capability. Production went ahead as the B version would be operational before the &quot;Advanced Technology Bomber&quot; (which became the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit]]), during a period when the B-52 would be increasingly vulnerable. The B-1B entered service in 1986 with the USAF [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) as a nuclear bomber.

In the early 1990s, following the [[Gulf War]] and concurrent with the disestablishment of SAC and its reassignment to the newly formed [[Air Combat Command]] (ACC), the B-1B was converted to conventional bombing use. It first served in combat during [[Bombing of Iraq (December 1998)|Operation Desert Fox]] in 1998 and again during the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO action in Kosovo]] the following year. The B-1B has supported U.S. and [[NATO]] military forces in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. The Lancer is the supersonic component of the USAF's long-range bomber force, along with the subsonic B-52 and B-2. The bomber is commonly called the &quot;Bone&quot; (originally from &quot;B-One&quot;). With the retirement of the [[General Dynamics/Grumman EF-111A Raven]] in 1998 and the [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat]] in 2006, the B-1B is the U.S. military's only active variable-sweep wing aircraft. The B-1B is expected to continue to serve into the 2030s, with the [[Next-Generation Bomber]] to start supplementing the B-1B in the 2020s.

===Background===
{{main |North American XB-70 Valkyrie}}

The U.S. Air Force in 1955 issued requirements for a new bomber combining the payload and range of the [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress]] with the Mach&amp;nbsp;2 maximum speed of the [[Convair B-58 Hustler]].&lt;ref name= Jenkins_99_p10&gt;Jenkins 1999, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 1957, the U.S. Air Force selected [[North American Aviation]]'s proposal to replace the B-52 with the [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie|B-70 Valkyrie]].&lt;ref name= Jenkins_p12-13&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1999|pp=12–13.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Valkyrie was a six-engine bomber that could reach [[Mach number|Mach]]&amp;nbsp;3 speeds at high altitude ({{convert|70000|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=2|disp=or}})&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p15-7&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1999|pp=15–17.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid [[interceptor aircraft]], the only effective anti-bomber weapon in the 1950s.&lt;ref name= 'Schwartz p.118'/&gt; Soviet aircraft were already unable to intercept the high-flying [[Lockheed U-2]];&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Ben and Leo Janos. ''Skunk Works''. Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Company, 1994. ISBN 0-316-74300-3.&lt;/ref&gt; the Valkyrie would fly at similar altitudes but much higher speeds.&lt;ref name= 'Schwartz p.118'/&gt; In combat, the B-70 was expected to simply fly right by the defenders.

By the late 1950s, however, anti-aircraft [[surface-to-air missile]]s (SAMs) could threaten high-altitude aircraft,&lt;ref name=Jenkins_1999_p21&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1999|p=21.}}&lt;/ref&gt; as demonstrated by the [[1960 U-2 incident|1960 downing]] of [[Gary Powers]]'s U-2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keesings.com/search?kssp_selected_tab=article&amp;kssp_a_id=17425n01sov &quot;May 1960&amp;nbsp;– The U-2 Incident.&amp;nbsp;– Soviet and American Statements.&quot;] ''Keesing's Record of World Events'', Volume 6, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; The USAF Strategic Air Command (SAC) began moving its bombers to low-level penetration before the U-2 downing. This tactic greatly reduces radar detection distances by use of [[terrain mask#Terrain masking|terrain masking]]; using features of the terrain like hills and valleys, the line-of-sight from the radar to the bomber can be broken, rendering the radar (and human observers) incapable of seeing the target.&lt;ref name=Spick_1986_p6-8/&gt; Even at somewhat higher altitudes, radar systems of the era were subject to &quot;clutter&quot; from stray returns from the ground and other objects, requiring a minimum angle above the ground to be effective. Bombers flying at low altitudes could remain under these angles simply by flying around the radar sites. This combination of effects made SAMs of the era ineffective against low-flying aircraft.&lt;ref name=Spick_1986_p6-8&gt;{{harvnb|Spick|1986|pp=6–8.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= 'Schwartz p.119'/&gt; The same effects also meant that low flying aircraft were difficult to detect by higher flying interceptors, since their radar systems could not readily pick out opposing aircraft against the clutter from ground reflections.

The switch from high-altitude to low-altitude flight profiles severely affected the B-70, whose design was highly tuned to provide the desired high-altitude performance.  Planners outlined a series of low-level profiles for the B-70, but higher drag at low level limited the B-70 to subsonic speed while dramatically decreasing its range.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_1999_p21/&gt; The result would be an aircraft with somewhat higher subsonic speed, but less range than the B-52 it was meant to replace. Unsuited for the new low-altitude role, and because of a growing shift to the [[intercontinental ballistic missile]] (ICBM) force, the B-70 bomber program was canceled in 1961 by President [[John F. Kennedy]],&lt;ref name= 'Schwartz p.118'&gt;{{harvnb|Schwartz|1998|p=118.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19950002358_1995102358.pdf &quot;NASA-CR-115702, B-70 Aircraft Study Final Report, Vol. I, p. I-38.&quot;] ''NASA'', 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; and the two XB-70 prototypes were used in a supersonic research program.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p14-6&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1999|pp=14–16.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although never intended for the low-level role, the B-52's flexibility allowed it to outlast its intended successor as the nature of the air war environment changed. The B-52's huge fuel load allowed it to operate at lower altitudes for longer times, and the large airframe allowed the addition of improved [[electronic countermeasure]]s suites to deal with radars.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knaack|1988|pp=279–280.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Vietnam War]] the concept that all future wars would be nuclear was turned on its head, and the &quot;big belly&quot; modifications increased the B-52's total bomb load to {{convert|60000|lb|kg}},&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knaack|1988|p=256.}}&lt;/ref&gt; turning it into a powerful tactical aircraft which could be used against ground troops along with strategic targets from high altitudes.&lt;ref name= 'Schwartz p.119'/&gt; The much smaller bomb bay of the B-70 would have made it much less useful in this role.

===Design studies and delays===
Although effective, the B-52 was not ideal for the low-level role. This led to a number of aircraft designs known as &quot;penetrators&quot;, which were tuned specifically for long-range low-altitude flight. The first of these designs to see operation was the supersonic [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark|F-111]] fighter-bomber, which used variable-sweep wings for tactical missions.&lt;ref&gt;Gunston 1978, pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar aircraft also emerged for other users as well, notably the [[TSR-2]], and later, [[Panavia Tornado]] and [[Sukhoi Su-24]]. A number of studies on a strategic-range counterpart followed.

The first post-B-70 strategic penetrator study was known as the ''Subsonic Low Altitude Bomber'' (SLAB), which was completed in 1961. This produced a design that looked more like an airliner than a bomber, with a large swept wing, T-tail and large [[turbofan|high-bypass engines]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Taylor, [http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=AD0330289 &quot;Subsonic Low Altitude Bomber&quot;], Wright-Patterson Air Force Base ASD-TDR-62-426, June 1962&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the similar ''Extended Range Strike Aircraft'' (ERSA), which added a [[variable-sweep wing]] [[planform]], then in vogue in the aviation industry. ERSA envisioned a relatively small aircraft with a {{convert|10000|lb|kg}} payload and a range of {{convert|8750|nmi|km|abbr=off}}, with {{convert|2500|nmi|km|abbr=on}} being flown at low altitudes. In August 1963 the similar ''Low-Altitude Manned Penetrator'' (LAMP) design was completed, which called for an aircraft with a {{convert|20000|lb|kg}} bomb load and somewhat shorter range of {{convert|7150|nmi|km|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pace|1998|pp=11–14.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= 'Knaack pp.575-6'&gt;{{harvnb|Knaack|1988|pp=575–576.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These all culminated in the October 1963 ''Advanced Manned Precision Strike System'' (AMPSS), which led to industry studies at [[Boeing]], [[General Dynamics]], and [[North American Aviation|North American]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Casil|2003|p=8.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= 'Knaack p.576'&gt;{{harvnb|Knaack|1988|p=576.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-1964, the USAF had revised its requirements and retitled the project as ''Advanced Manned Strategic Aircraft'' (AMSA), which differed from AMPSS primarily in that it also demanded a high-speed high-altitude capability, similar to that of the existing Mach 2 class B-58 Hustler.&lt;ref name= 'Knaack p.575'&gt;{{harvnb|Knaack|1988|p=575.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the lengthy series of design studies, Rockwell engineers joked that the new name actually stood for &quot;America's Most Studied Aircraft&quot;.&lt;ref name=study&gt;Wykes, J. H. [http://www.aiaa.org/content.cfm?pageid=406&amp;gTable=mtgpaper&amp;gID=62575 &quot;The Evolution of a Strategic Bomber.&quot;] ''AIAA'', 12–14 May 1981. Retrieved: 8 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p23&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1999|p=23.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arguments that led to the cancellation of the [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie|B-70 program]] had led some to question the need for a new strategic bomber of any sort. The air force was adamant about retaining bombers as part of the [[nuclear triad]] concept that included bombers, ICBMs, and [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s (SLBMs) in a combined package that complicated any potential defense. They argued that the bomber was needed to attack hardened military targets and to provide a safe [[counterforce]] option because the bombers could be quickly launched into safe loitering areas where they could not be attacked. However, the introduction of the SLBM mooted the mobility and survivability argument, and a newer generation of ICBMs had the accuracy and speed needed to attack point targets. During this time, ICBMs were seen as a less costly option based on their lower unit cost,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pace|1998|p=10.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but development costs were much higher.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_1999_p21/&gt; [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] preferred ICBMs over bombers for the Air Force portion of the deterrent force&lt;ref name= 'Knaack pp.576-7'&gt;{{harvnb|Knaack|1988|pp=576–577.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and felt a new expensive bomber was not needed.&lt;ref name=fas&gt;[http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/bomber/b-1a.htm &quot;B-1A page.&quot;] ''fas.org''. Retrieved: 20 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= 'Knaack p.576-8'/&gt; McNamara limited the AMSA program to studies and component development beginning in 1964.&lt;ref name= 'Knaack p.576-8'&gt;{{harvnb|Knaack|1988|pp=576–578.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Program studies continued; [[IBM]] and [[Autonetics]] were awarded AMSA advanced avionics study contracts in 1968.&lt;ref name= 'Knaack p.576-8'/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p23-6/&gt; McNamara remained opposed to the program in favor of upgrading the existing [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] fleet and adding nearly 300 [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark#FB-111A.2FF-111G|FB-111]]s for shorter range roles then being filled by the [[Convair B-58 Hustler|B-58]].&lt;ref name= 'Schwartz p.119'&gt;Schwartz 1998, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= 'Knaack p.576-8'/&gt; He again vetoed funding for AMSA aircraft development in 1968.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p23-6&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1999|pp=23–26.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===B-1A program===
President [[Richard Nixon]] reestablished the AMSA program after taking office, keeping with his administration's [[flexible response]] strategy that required a [[Single Integrated Operations Plan#Counterforce migrates to deterrence and warfighting|broad range of options short of general nuclear war]].&lt;ref name= 'Knaack p.579'&gt;{{harvnb|Knaack|1988|p=579.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon's Secretary of Defense, [[Melvin Laird]], reviewed the programs and decided to lower the numbers of FB-111s, since they lacked the desired range, and recommended that the AMSA design studies be accelerated.&lt;ref name= 'Knaack p.579'/&gt; In April 1969, the program officially became the ''B-1A''.&lt;ref name= 'Schwartz p.119'/&gt;&lt;ref name= 'Knaack p.579'/&gt; This was the first entry in the [[1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system|new bomber designation series]], first created in 1962.

Retrieved: 8 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; A fourth prototype, built to production standards, was ordered in the fiscal year 1976 budget. Plans called for 240 B-1As to be built, with initial operational capability set for 1979.&lt;ref name= 'Sorrels p.27'&gt;{{harvnb|Sorrels|1983|p=27.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rockwell's design featured a number of features common to 1960s U.S. designs. Among these was the use of a &quot;crew capsule&quot; that ejected as a unit during emergencies, which was introduced to improve survivability in the case of an ejection at high speed. Additionally, the design featured large variable-sweep wings in order to provide both high lift during takeoff and landing, and low drag during a high-speed dash phase.&lt;ref name= 'lee p.13'/&gt;  With the wings set to their widest position the aircraft had considerably better lift and power than the B-52, allowing it to operate from a much wider variety of bases. Penetration of the [[USSR]]'s defenses would take place at supersonic speed, crossing them as quickly as possible before entering into the less defended &quot;heartland&quot; where speeds could be reduced again.&lt;ref name= 'lee p.13'/&gt; The large size and fuel capacity of the design would allow the &quot;dash&quot; portion of the flight to be relatively long.

In order to achieve the required Mach&amp;nbsp;2 performance at high altitudes, the exhaust nozzles and air intake inlets were variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whitford|1987|p=136.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, it had been expected that a Mach&amp;nbsp;1.2 performance could be achieved at low altitude, which required that titanium be used in critical areas in the fuselage and wing structure. The low altitude performance requirement was later lowered to Mach&amp;nbsp;0.85, reducing the amount of titanium and therefore cost.&lt;ref name= 'Knaack p.584'/&gt; A pair of small [[Canard (aeronautics)|vanes]] mounted near the nose are part of an active vibration damping system that smooths out the otherwise bumpy low-altitude ride.&lt;ref&gt;Schefter, Jim.

In 1970, the estimated unit cost was $40 million, and by 1975, this figure had climbed to $70 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1999|p=44.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New problems and cancellation===
In 1976, Soviet pilot [[Viktor Belenko]] defected to Japan with his [[Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25|MiG-25 &quot;Foxbat&quot;]].&lt;ref&gt;Willis, David K. [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/csmonitor_historic/access/261218552.html?dids=261218552:261218552&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Sep+16%2C+1976&amp;author=By+David+K.+Willis+Staff+correspondent+of+The+Christian+Science+Monitor&amp;pub=Christian+Science+Monitor&amp;desc=Japan's+scrutiny+of+Soviet+jet+jars+detente&amp;pqatl=google &quot;Japan's scrutiny of Soviet jet jars detente.&quot;] ''Christian Science Monitor'', 16 September 1976. Retrieved: 23 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; During debriefing he described a new &quot;super-Foxbat&quot; (almost certainly referring to the [[Mikoyan MiG-31|MiG-31]]) that had [[look-down/shoot-down]] [[radar]] systems in order to attack cruise missiles. This would also make any low-level penetration aircraft &quot;visible&quot; and easy to attack.&lt;ref&gt;Donald 2004, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that the B-1's armament suite was similar to the B-52, and it now appeared no more likely to survive Soviet airspace than the B-52, the program was increasingly questioned.&lt;ref name= 'Knaack p.590'&gt;{{harvnb|Knaack|1988|p=590.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Senator [[William Proxmire]] continually derided it in public, arguing it was an outlandishly expensive dinosaur. During the 1976 federal election campaign, [[Jimmy Carter]] made it one of the Democratic Party's platforms, saying &quot;The B-1 bomber is an example of a proposed system which should not be funded and would be wasteful of taxpayers' dollars.&quot;&lt;ref name=time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919040-1,00.html &quot;Carter's Big Decision: Down Goes the B-1, Here Comes the Cruise.&quot;] ''Time'', 11 July 1977. Retrieved: 8 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Carter took office in 1977 he ordered a review of the entire program. By this point the projected cost of the program had risen to over $100 million per aircraft, although this was lifetime cost over 20 years. He was informed of the relatively new work on [[stealth aircraft]] that had started in 1975, and he decided that this was a better avenue of approach than the B-1. [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] officials also stated that the [[AGM-86 ALCM|AGM-86]] Air Launched Cruise Missile (ALCM) launched from the existing B-52 fleet would give the USAF equal capability of penetrating Soviet airspace. With a range of {{convert|1500|mi|km}}, the ALCM could be launched well outside the range of any Soviet defenses and penetrate at low altitude just like a bomber, but in much greater numbers at a lower cost.&lt;ref name= 'Withington p.7'&gt;{{harvnb|Withington|2006|p=7.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A small number of B-52s could launch hundreds of ALCMs, saturating the defense. A program to improve the B-52 and develop and deploy the ALCM would cost perhaps 20% of the price to deploy the planned 244 B-1As.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;

On 30 June 1977, Carter announced that the B-1A would be canceled in favor of ICBMs, SLBMs, and a fleet of modernized B-52s armed with ALCMs.&lt;ref name= 'Sorrels p.27'/&gt; Carter called it &quot;one of the most difficult decisions that I've made since I've been in office.&quot; No mention of the stealth work was made public with the program being [[top secret]], but today it is known that in early 1978 he authorized the ''Advanced Technology Bomber'' (ATB) project, which eventually led to the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 Spirit]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pace p20-27&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pace|1999|pp=20–27.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domestically, the reaction to the cancellation was split along partisan lines.

Soviet news agency [[Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union|TASS]] commented that &quot;the implementation of these militaristic plans has seriously complicated efforts for the limitation of the strategic arms race.&quot;&lt;ref name=time/&gt; Western military leaders were generally happy with the decision.

Flight tests of the four B-1A prototypes for the B-1A program continued through April 1981. The program included 70 flights totaling 378 hours. A top speed of Mach&amp;nbsp;2.22 was reached by the second B-1A. Engine testing also continued during this time with the YF101 engines totaling almost 7,600 hours.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p46&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1999|p=46.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during this period that the Soviets started to assert themselves in several new theaters of action, in particular through [[Cuba]] during the [[Angolan Civil War]] starting in 1975 and the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] in 1979. U.S. strategy to this point had been focused on [[containment|containing]] [[Communism]] and preparation for war in Europe. The new Soviet actions revealed that the military lacked capability outside these narrow confines.&lt;ref name=LRCA&gt;Liggett, Lieutenant Colonel William R.

During the 1980 presidential campaign, [[Ronald Reagan]] campaigned heavily on the platform that Carter was weak on defense, citing the cancellation of the B-1 program as an example, a theme he continued using into the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Reagan, President Ronald.

===B-1B program===
On taking office, Reagan was faced with the same decision as Carter before: whether to continue with the B-1 for the short term, or to wait for the development of the ATB, a much more advanced aircraft. Studies suggested that the existing B-52 fleet with ALCM would remain a credible threat until 1985, as it was predicted that 75% of the B-52 force would survive to attack its targets.&lt;ref name=post-b-52&gt;Mitchell, Douglas D.

The LRCA evaluated the B-1, F-111 and ATB as possible solutions; an emphasis was placed on multi-role capabilities, as opposed to purely strategic operations.&lt;ref name=post-b-52/&gt;

In 1981, it was believed the B-1 could be in operation before the ATB, covering the transitionary period between the B-52's increasing vulnerability and the ATB's introduction. Reagan decided the best solution was to procure both the B-1 and ATB, and on 2 October 1981 Reagan announced that 100 B-1s were to be ordered to fill the LRCA role.&lt;ref name= 'lee p.13'/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reagan approves&quot;&gt;Coates, James.

Opposition to the plan was widespread within Congress. Critics pointed out that many of the original problems remained in both areas of performance and expense.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Casil|2003|p=7.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular it seemed the B-52 fitted with electronics similar to the B-1B would be equally able to avoid interception, as the speed advantage of the B-1 was now minimal.

==Design==

===Overview===
The B-1 has a [[blended wing body]] configuration, with [[variable-sweep wing]], four [[turbofan|turbofan engines]], and triangular fin control surfaces. The wings can sweep from 15 degrees to 67.5 degrees (full forward to full sweep). Forward-swept wing settings are used for [[takeoff]], [[landing]]s and high-altitude maximum [[cruise (flight)|cruise]]. Aft-swept wing settings are used in high subsonic and supersonic flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Withington|2006|p=16.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The B-1's variable-sweep wings and [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] provide it with better takeoff performance, allowing it to use more runways than previous bombers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knaack|1988|p=587.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The length of the aircraft presented a flexing problem due to air turbulence at low altitude. To alleviate this, Rockwell included small triangular fin control surfaces or vanes near the nose on the B-1. The B-1's Structural Mode Control System rotates the vanes automatically to counteract turbulence and smooth out the ride.&lt;ref&gt;Wykes, J. H.

Unlike the B-1A, the B-1B cannot reach Mach&amp;nbsp;2+ speeds; its maximum speed is Mach&amp;nbsp;1.25 (about 950&amp;nbsp;mph or 1,530&amp;nbsp;km/h at altitude),&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p60&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1999|p=60.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but its low-level speed increased to Mach&amp;nbsp;0.92 (700&amp;nbsp;mph, 1,130&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref name=BNA_B-1B_specs&gt;{{harvnb|Pace|1998|p=64.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speed of the current version of the aircraft is limited by the need to avoid damage to its structure and air intakes. To help lower its radar cross section (RCS), the B-1B uses [[serpentine shape|serpentine]] air [[intake|intake ducts]] and fixed [[intake ramp]]s, which limit its speed compared to the B-1A. Vanes in the intake ducts serve to deflect and shield radar emissions from the highly reflective engine compressor blades.&lt;ref name=Spick_1986_p44-5&gt;{{harvnb|Spick|1986|pp=44–45.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational history==

===Strategic Air Command===
The second B-1B, &quot;The Star of Abilene&quot;, was the first B-1B delivered to the USAF [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) in June 1985. Initial operational capability was reached on 1 October 1986 and the B-1B was placed on nuclear alert status.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pace|1998|pp=62, 69.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p83&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1999|p=83.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The B-1 received the official name &quot;Lancer&quot; on 15 March 1990. However, the bomber has been commonly called the &quot;Bone&quot;; a nickname that appears to stem from an early newspaper article on the aircraft wherein its name was phonetically spelled out as &quot;B-ONE&quot; with the hyphen inadvertently omitted.&lt;ref name= Jenkins_p67&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins 1999|p=67.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Decommissioned B-1 Bomber Travels Along I-5 (6327003326).jpg|thumb|left|A dismantled decommissioned B-1 being transported by flatbed truck]]
In late 1990 engine fires in two Lancers caused the grounding of the fleet. The cause was traced back to problems in the first-stage fan, the aircraft were placed on &quot;limited alert&quot;; in other words, they were grounded unless a nuclear war broke out. Following inspections and repairs they were returned to duty beginning on 6 February 1991.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p116&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1999|p=116.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B-1 aircrew logbook entry.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the engine problems, the B-1B was effectively sidelined in the [[First Gulf War]].&lt;ref name='dao 1'&gt;Dao 2001, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally designed strictly for nuclear war, the B-1's development as an effective conventional bomber was delayed until the 1990s. The collapse of the Soviet Union had brought the B-1's nuclear role into question, leading to President [[George H. W. Bush]] ordering a $3 billion conventional refit.&lt;ref name='dao 4'&gt;Dao 2001, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1991, the B-1 had a fledgling conventional capability, forty of them able to drop the {{convert|500|lb|kg}} Mk-82 General Purpose (GP) bomb, although mostly from low altitude. Despite being cleared for this role, the problems with the engines precluded their use in [[Operation Desert Storm]].&lt;ref name='Withington p. 10'/&gt;  B-1s were primarily reserved for strategic nuclear strike missions at this time, providing the role of airborne nuclear deterrent against the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name= 'Withington p. 10'&gt;{{harvnb|Withington|2006|p=10.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The B-52 was more suited to the role of conventional warfare and it was used by coalition forces instead.&lt;ref name='Withington p. 10'/&gt;

After the inactivation of Strategic Air Command (SAC) and the establishment of the [[Air Combat Command]] (ACC) in 1992, the B-1 developed a greater conventional weapons capability. Part of this development was the start-up of the U.S. Air Force Weapons School B-1 Division.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Ed.

Retrieved: 14 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, two additional B-1 bomb wings were also created in the [[Air National Guard]], with former fighter wings in the [[Kansas Air National Guard]] and the [[Georgia Air National Guard]] converting to the aircraft.&lt;ref name='Withington p. 11'&gt;{{harvnb|Withington|2006|p=11.}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1990s, the B-1 could employ GP weapons as well as various CBUs. By the end of the 1990s, with the advent of the &quot;Block D&quot; upgrade, the B-1 boasted a full array of guided and unguided munitions. The B-1B no longer carries nuclear weapons;&lt;ref name= 'lee p.13'/&gt; its nuclear capability was disabled by 1995 with the removal of nuclear arming and fuzing hardware.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p141&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1999|p=141.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conventional role===
[[File:B1s.jpg|thumb|A B-1B Lancer with wings swept full forward |alt=Top forward view of gray aircraft with wings swept forward banking right. Underneath are strips of white clouds and uninhabited terrain.]]

The B-1 was first used in combat in support of operations against [[Iraq]], during [[Operation Desert Fox]] in December 1998, employing unguided GP weapons. B-1s have been subsequently used in [[Operation Allied Force]] (Kosovo) and, most notably, in [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|Operation Enduring Freedom]] in Afghanistan and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].&lt;ref name= 'lee p.13'/&gt; The B-1's role in Operation Allied Force has been criticized as the aircraft was not used until after enemy defenses had been suppressed by aircraft like the older B-52 it was intended to replace.&lt;ref name='dao 1'/&gt; The B-1 has deployed an array of conventional weapons in war zones, most notably the GBU-31, {{convert|2000|lb|kg}} [[Joint Direct Attack Munition]] (JDAM).&lt;ref name= 'lee p.13' /&gt; In the first six months of Operation Enduring Freedom, eight B-1s dropped almost 40 percent of aerial ordnance, including some 3,900 JDAMs.&lt;ref name=&quot;defensetech21feb14&quot;/&gt; JDAM munitions were heavily used by the B-1 over Iraq, notably on 7 April 2003 in an unsuccessful attempt to kill [[Saddam Hussein]] and his two sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Withington|2006|pp=75–76.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the height of the Iraq War, a B-1 was permanently airborne to provide rapid precision bombardment upon important targets as intelligence identified them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Withington|2006|p=77.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Operation Enduring Freedom, the B-1 was able to raise its [[availability|mission capable rate]] to 79%.&lt;ref name=AF_sheet/&gt;

The B-1 has higher survivability and speed when compared to the older B-52, which it was intended to replace. It also holds 61 [[Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|FAI]] world records for speed, payload, distance, and time-to-climb in different aircraft weight classes.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_appE&gt;{{harvnb |Jenkins|1999|p=Appendix E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boeing.com/history/bna/b1b.htm &quot;History&amp;nbsp;– B-1 Lancer Bomber.&quot;] ''Boeing''. Retrieved: 31 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1983, three B-1Bs set a long distance record for the aircraft, which demonstrated its ability to conduct extended mission lengths to strike anywhere in the world and return to base without any stops.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Dorr|1997|p=224.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[National Aeronautic Association]] recognized the B-1B for completing one of the 10 most memorable record flights for 1994.&lt;ref name=AF_sheet/&gt;

Of the 100 B-1Bs built, 93 remained in 2000 after losses in accidents. In June 2001, the Pentagon sought to place one-third of its then fleet into storage; this proposal resulted in several U.S. Air National Guard officers and members of Congress lobbying against the proposal, including the drafting of an amendment to prevent such cuts.&lt;ref name='dao 1'/&gt; The 2001 proposal was intended to allow money to be diverted to further upgrades to the remaining B-1Bs, such as computer modernization.&lt;ref name='dao 1'/&gt; In 2003, accompanied by the removal of B-1Bs from the two bomb wings in the Air National Guard, the USAF decided to retire 33 aircraft to concentrate its budget on maintaining availability of remaining B-1Bs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=ADSB&amp;s_site=azstarnet&amp;f_site=azstarnet&amp;f_sitename=Arizona+Daily+Star%2C+The+%28AZ%29&amp;p_multi=ADSB&amp;p_theme=gannett&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0F59D36BE743E3B9&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM &quot;B-1 bomber's final flight.&quot;] ''Arizona Star'', 21 August 2002.

==Variants==
[[File:B1ArearWingsMus.JPG|thumb|The rear section showing the B-1A's pointed radome |alt=]]

;B-1A
The B-1A was the original B-1 design with variable engine intakes and Mach&amp;nbsp;2.2 top speed. Four prototypes were built; no production units were manufactured.&lt;ref name=AF_Alma_facts-figs_2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Complete_Encyclopedia&gt;Donald 1997, p. 723.&lt;/ref&gt;
;B-1B
The B-1B is a revised B-1 design with reduced radar signature and a top speed of Mach&amp;nbsp;1.25. It was otherwise optimized for low-level penetration. A total of 100 B-1Bs were produced.&lt;ref name=Complete_Encyclopedia/&gt;

Retrieved: 8 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Existing external hardpoints would be modified to allow multiple conventional weapons to be carried, increasing overall loadout. For air-to-air defense, an [[Active Electronically Scanned Array]] (AESA) radar would be added and some existing hardpoints modified to carry air-to-air missiles. If needed the B-1R could escape from unfavorable air-to-air encounters with its Mach&amp;nbsp;2+ speed.

==Accidents and incidents==
Ten B-1s have been lost due to accidents. Between 1984 and 2001, 17 crew members and people on board have been killed in B-1 accidents.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;

===Crashes===
* On 29 August 1984, B-1A (AF Ser. No. 74-0159) stalled and crashed while performing minimum control speed tests at low altitude. The crew used the [[escape crew capsule|escape capsule]] to leave the bomber, but the parachutes deployed improperly, causing the capsule to hit nose down. The impact killed the B-1's pilot, Rockwell test pilot Doug Benefield, and seriously injured two other crew members.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p63&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1999|p=63.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pace|1998|p=37.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In September 1987, B-1B (s/n 84-0052) from the [[96th Bomb Wing]], 338th Combat Crew Training Squadron, [[Dyess Air Force Base|Dyess AFB]] crashed near [[La Junta, Colorado]] while flying on a low-level training route. This was the only B-1B crash to occur with six crew members aboard. The two crew members in [[jump seat]]s, and one of the four crew members in [[ejection seat]]s perished. The root cause of the accident was thought to be a [[bird strike]] on a wing's [[leading edge]] during the low-level flight. The impact was severe enough to sever fuel and hydraulic lines on one side of the aircraft, the other side's engines functioned long enough to allow for ejection. The B-1B fleet was later modified to protect these supply lines.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p114&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|1999|pp=114–116.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November 1988, B-1B (s/n 85-0063) from the 96th Bomb Wing, 337th Bomb Squadron, Dyess AFB crashed near [[Tye, Texas]] after a fire broke out above the left engines. All four crew members successfully ejected from the aircraft.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p114/&gt;
* In November 1988, B-1B (s/n 85-0076) from the [[28th Bomb Wing]], 37th Bomb Squadron, Ellsworth AFB crashed short of the runway at Ellsworth AFB during adverse weather. All four crew members ejected successfully.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p114/&gt;
* In November 1992, B-1B (s/n 86-0106) from the [[7th Bomb Wing]], 337th Bomb Squadron, Dyess AFB, Texas, flying on a low-level training flight crashed into a mountain near [[Van Horn, Texas]]. All four members of the crew were killed, and the cause was attributed to pilot error.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p114/&gt;
* In September 1997, B-1B (s/n 85-0078) from the [[28th Bomb Wing]], 37th Bomb Squadron, Ellsworth AFB, [[South Dakota]], flying in the Powder River Military Operating Area crashed {{convert|25|mi|km|abbv=off|sigfig=2}} north of [[Alzada, Montana]].

===Other accidents and notable incidents===
[[File:B1 fire.jpg|thumb|A B-1B with a brake fire after a hard landing at [[Rhein-Main Air Base|Rhein-Main AB]], Germany, June 1994. |alt=Black aircraft trailed by column of black smoke and fire on runway as fire trucks close in on the flame from behind]]

* In October 1990, while flying a training route in eastern Colorado, B-1B (s/n 86-0128) from the [[384th Bomb Wing]], 28th Bomb Squadron, [[McConnell AFB]], experienced an explosion as the engines reached full power without afterburners. Fire on the aircraft's left was spotted. The #1 engine was shut down and its [[fire extinguisher]] was activated. The accident investigation determined that the engine had suffered catastrophic failure, engine blades had cut through the engine mounts and the engine became detached from the aircraft.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p114/&gt;
* In December 1990, B-1B (s/n 83-0071) from the [[96th Bomb Wing]], 337th Bomb Squadron, Dyess AFB, Texas, experienced a jolt that caused the #3 engine to shut down with its fire extinguisher activating. This event, coupled with the October 1990 engine incident, led to a 50+ day grounding of the B-1Bs not on [[Second strike#Implementation|nuclear alert]] status. The problem was eventually traced back to problems in the first-stage fan, and all B-1Bs were equipped with modified engines.&lt;ref name=Jenkins_p114/&gt;
* In June 1994, B-1B (s/n 84-0057) from the [[7th Bomb Wing]], [[9th Bomb Squadron]], made an emergency divert to [[Rhein-Main Air Base]], Germany due to a wing sweep malfunction.  The crew made a high speed landing at Rhein-Main and stopped 100 feet short of the end of the runway.  Afterward the overheated brakes led to a fire of the right main landing gear, but was quickly extinguished.&lt;ref&gt;Dorr, Robert F.

Paducah, Kentucky. : Turner Publishing Company, 1996. ISBN 1563112787.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 15 September 2005, B-1B (s/n 85-0066) was extensively damaged by fire while landing at [[Andersen Air Force Base]], [[Guam]]. The investigation into the incident concluded that leaking hydraulic fluid and sparks from a wheel being gouged caused a fire to start in the aircraft's right main landing gear as it touched down. The resulting fire damaged the B-1's right wing, engine nacelle, airframe and landing gear, leading to an estimated repair cost of more than $32&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;Stemple, Master Sgt. John.

* On 8 May 2006, B-1B (s/n 86-0132) from the [[7th Bomb Wing]], 9th Bomb Squadron, Dyess AFB, Texas, landed &quot;gear-up&quot; during recovery from an 11-hour ferry flight to the island of Diego Garcia. A resulting fire was quickly extinguished and the crew escaped through the top hatch with only a minor back injury to the co-pilot. The air force investigation concluded that the crew &quot;forgot to lower the [[landing gear]]&quot; based on the following reasons: 1) co-pilot task oversaturation, 2) co-pilot's wanting to complete a long mission, 3) neither pilot completed the landing checklist, 4) co-pilot's belief that the pilot had lowered the landing gear when he had not, 5) pilot had turned over control to the co-pilot on the final approach and the pilot had reported to base that the landing gear was down when it was not - indicator lights showing the landing gear was still up were working and apparently ignored. As a result the B-1B impacted and slid on the runway, which caused approximately $8 million of damage to the aircraft and runway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acc.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123027298 &quot;Report: pilot error caused B-1B crash.&quot;] ''Air Combat Command Public Affairs'', USAF, 18 September 2006.
