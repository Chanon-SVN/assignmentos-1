The '''Boston Red Sox''' are an American professional [[baseball]] team based in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], that competes in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). They are members of the [[American League East|East Division]] of the [[American League]] (AL). The Red Sox have won 8 [[World Series]], having appeared in 12. Founded in {{by|1901}} as one of the American League's eight charter franchises, the Red Sox's home [[baseball park|ballpark]] has been [[Fenway Park]] since {{by|1912}}. The &quot;Red Sox&quot; name was chosen by the team owner, [[John I. Taylor]], around {{by|1908}}, following the lead of previous teams that had been known as the &quot;[[Boston Red Stockings (disambiguation)|Boston Red Stockings]]&quot;, including the forerunner of the [[Atlanta Braves]].

Boston was a dominant team in the new league, defeating the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in the first [[World Series]] in [[1903 World Series|1903]] and winning four more championships by {{by|1918}}. However, they then went into one of the longest championship [[List of Major League Baseball franchise postseason droughts|droughts]] in baseball history, called by some the &quot;[[Curse of the Bambino]]&quot; after its alleged beginning with the Red Sox's sale of [[Babe Ruth]] to the rival [[New York Yankees]] two years after their world championship in 1918, an 86-year wait before the team's sixth World Championship in {{wsy|2004}}. The team's history during that period was punctuated with some of the most memorable moments in World Series history, including [[Enos Slaughter]]'s &quot;[[Slaughter's Mad Dash|mad dash]]&quot; in {{wsy|1946}}, the &quot;[[The Impossible Dream (1967)|Impossible Dream]]&quot; of {{wsy|1967}}, [[Carlton Fisk]]'s home run in {{wsy|1975}}, and [[Bill Buckner]]'s error in {{wsy|1986}}. Following their victory in the [[2013 World Series]], they became the first team to win three [[World Series]] trophies in the 21st century, including championships in 2004 and {{wsy|2007}}. Red Sox history has also been marked by the team's [[Yankees–Red Sox rivalry|intense rivalry]] with the Yankees, arguably the fiercest and most historic in [[List of sports rivalries|North American professional sports]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FierceRivalry&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;StrongestRivalry&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UltimateRivalry&gt;{{cite news |title=Sport's ultimate rivalry; Yanks-Red Sox epic battles go way back |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/playoffs/2004-10-20-yanks-sox-rivalry_x.htm |date=October 21, 2004 |accessdate=January 26, 2011 |first=Hal |last=Bodley |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |page=3C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Boston Red Sox are owned by [[Fenway Sports Group]], which also own [[Liverpool F.C.]] of the [[Premier League]] in England. The Red Sox are consistently one of the top MLB teams in average road attendance, while the small capacity of Fenway Park prevents them from leading in overall attendance.&lt;ref name=Attendance&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/attendance?sort=home_avg&amp;year=2007&amp;seasonType=2 |title=MLB Attendance Report – 2007 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=November 1, 2007 |accessdate=November 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; From May 15, 2003 to April 10, 2013, the Red Sox sold out every home game—a total of 820 games (794 regular season) for a major professional sports record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Golen |first=Jimmy |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2007-05-15-261793538_x.htm |title=Tigers 7, Red Sox 2 |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=May 15, 2007 |accessdate=October 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=ycn-8166895 |first=Aaron |last=Smith |title=Top five most loyal MLB fan bases |publisher=[[Yahoo!

==Nickname==
The name ''Red Sox'', chosen by owner [[John I. Taylor]] after the 1907 season, refers to the red hose in the team uniform beginning {{by|1908}}. ''Sox'' had been previously adopted for the [[Chicago White Sox]] by newspapers needing a headline-friendly form of ''Stockings'', as &quot;Stockings Win!&quot; in [[Large font|large type]] would not fit on a page. The team name &quot;Red Sox&quot; had previously been used as early as 1888 by a 'colored' team from Norfolk, Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1888-08-27/ed-1/seq-8/;words=Sox+Cuban+Red?date1=1836&amp;rows=20&amp;searchType=basic&amp;state=&amp;date2=1889&amp;proxtext=%22red+sox%22+cubans&amp;y=0&amp;x=0&amp;dateFilterType=yearRange&amp;index=0|title=The Start of the Red Sox|accessdate=25 November 2012|newspaper=New-York Tribune|date=August 27, 1888}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Spanish language]] media sometimes refers to the team as ''Medias Rojas'', a translation of &quot;red socks&quot;. The official Spanish site uses the variant &quot;Los Red Sox&quot;.

The Red Stockings nickname was first used for a baseball team by the [[Cincinnati Reds|Cincinnati Red Stockings]], who were members of the pioneering [[National Association of Base Ball Players]]. Managed by [[Harry Wright]], Cincinnati adopted a uniform with white knickers and red stockings, and earned the famous nickname, a year or two before hiring the first fully professional team in 1869. When the club folded after the 1870 season, Wright was hired by Boston businessman [[Ivers Whitney Adams]]&lt;ref&gt;From George V. Tuohey (1897). A History of the Boston Baseball Club: A concise and accurate history of Base Ball from its inception. Boston, Massachusetts: M. F. Quinn &amp; Co. p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; to organize a new team in Boston, and he did, bringing three teammates and the &quot;Red Stockings&quot; nickname along (Most nicknames were then only nicknames, neither club names nor registered trademarks, so the migration was informal). The [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Red Stockings]] won four championships in the five seasons of the new [[National Association of Baseball Players|National Association]], the first professional league.

When a new Cincinnati club was formed as a charter member of the [[National League]] in 1876, the &quot;Red Stockings&quot; nickname was commonly reserved for them once again, and the Boston team was referred to as the &quot;Red Caps&quot;. Other names were sometimes used before Boston officially adopted the nickname &quot;Braves&quot; in {{by|1912}}; the club [[Boston Braves To Milwaukee|eventually left Boston for Milwaukee]] and is now playing in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]].

[[File:BostonRedSox1908logo.svg|thumb|left|200px|The Red Sox logo worn on uniforms in 1908, announcing the team's first official nickname]]In {{by|1901}}, the upstart [[American League]] established a competing club in Boston. (Originally, a team was supposed to be started in Buffalo, but league ownership at the last minute removed that city from their plans in favor of the expansion Boston franchise.) For seven seasons, the AL team wore ''dark blue'' stockings and had no official nickname. They were simply &quot;Boston&quot;, &quot;Bostonians&quot; or &quot;the Bostons&quot;; or the &quot;Americans&quot; or &quot;Boston Americans&quot; as in &quot;American Leaguers&quot;, Boston being a two-team city. Their 1901–1907 jerseys, both home and road, simply read &quot;Boston&quot;, except for 1902 when they sported large letters &quot;B&quot; and &quot;A&quot; denoting &quot;Boston&quot; and &quot;American.&quot; Newspaper writers of the time used other nicknames for the club, including &quot;Somersets&quot; (for owner [[Charles Somers]]), &quot;Plymouth Rocks&quot;, &quot;Beaneaters&quot;, the &quot;Collinsites&quot; (for manager [[Jimmy Collins]])&quot;, and &quot;Pilgrims.&quot;

For years many sources have listed &quot;Pilgrims&quot; as the early Boston AL team's ''official'' nickname, but researcher Bill Nowlin has demonstrated that the name was barely used, if at all, during the team's early years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/articles/boston_pilgrims_story.shtml Nowlin's follow-up article in the ''The National Pastime''. Apparently this originated with a writer for the ''[[Washington Post]]'' during 1906, and by 1907 it started to be retroactively applied to the 1903 club, even by Boston newspapers.]&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the nickname appears to be a poem entitled &quot;The Pilgrims At Home&quot; written by Edwin Fitzwilliam that was sung at the 1907 home opener (&quot;Rory O'More&quot; melody).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celebrateboston.com/sports/baseball/bostonpilgrims.htm |title=The Boston Pilgrims Did Exist |publisher=Celebrateboston.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This nickname was commonly used during that season, perhaps because the team had a new manager and several rookie players. [[John I. Taylor]] had said in December 1907 that the Pilgrims &quot;sounded too much like homeless wanderers.&quot;

The National League club in Boston, though seldom called the &quot;Red Stockings&quot; anymore, still wore red trim. In {{by|1907}}, the National League club adopted an all-white uniform, and the American League team saw an opportunity. On December 18, 1907, Taylor announced that the club had officially adopted red as its new team color. The 1908 uniforms featured a large icon of a red stocking angling across the shirt front. For 1908, the National League club returned to wearing red trim, but the American League team finally had an official nickname, and would remain the &quot;Red Sox&quot; for good.

The name is often [[List of baseball nicknames|shortened]] to &quot;Bosox&quot; or &quot;BoSox&quot;, a combination of &quot;Boston&quot; and &quot;Sox&quot; (similar to the [[Chicago White Sox|&quot;ChiSox&quot;]] in Chicago or the minor league [[Pawtucket Red Sox|&quot;PawSox&quot;]] of Pawtucket). Sportswriters sometimes refer to the Red Sox as the ''Crimson Hose''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.courant.com/colin_mcenroe_to_wit/2007/10/crimson-hose.html|title=Colin McEnroe at the Hartford Courant}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''the Olde Towne Team''. Recently, media has begun to casually call them the &quot;Sawx&quot;, reflecting how the word is pronounced with a [[New England English|New England accent]]. However, most fans simply refer to the team as the &quot;Sox&quot; when the context is understood to mean Red Sox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20080420&amp;content_id=2559253&amp;vkey=recap&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=bos |title=Boston Red Sox News &amp;#124; RedSox.com: News |publisher=Boston.redsox.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of the Boston Red Sox}}

=== 1901–1919 ===
[[File:Boston Americans team picture.jpg|left|250px|thumb|The 1901 Boston Americans team photograph]]
In {{by|1901}}, the minor Western League, led by [[Ban Johnson]], declared its equality with the [[National League]], then the only major league in baseball. Johnson changed the name of the league to the American League, leading teams in his league to be christened with the unofficial nickname &quot;Americans&quot;. This was especially true in the case of the new Boston franchise, which would not adopt an official nickname until {{by|1908}}.

[[File:Boston Americans logo.png|thumb|170px|The Americans logo, 1901–07]]
The upstart league placed franchises in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] and [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. After looking at his new league, Ban Johnson decided that he would need a team in Boston to compete with the National League team there, and so cancelled the Buffalo club's franchise, offering one to a new club in Boston. Playing their home games at [[Huntington Avenue Grounds]], the Boston franchise finished second and third before capturing their first pennant in 1903 and repeating the next year. Those teams were led by manager and star [[third baseman]] [[Jimmy Collins]], outfielders [[Chick Stahl]], [[Buck Freeman]], and [[Patsy Dougherty]], and [[pitcher]] [[Cy Young]], who in 1901 won the pitching [[Triple crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]] with 33 wins (41.8% of the team's 79 games), 1.62 ERA and 158 strikeouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/y/youngcy01.shtml|title=Cy Young Statistics&amp;nbsp;— Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=February 17, 2008|author=Baseball-Reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 1901 to {{by|1904}} seasons rank among the best four-year runs ever.

In [[1903 Major League Baseball season|1903]], [[1903 Boston Americans season|Boston]] participated in the [[1903 World Series|first modern World Series]], going up against the [[1903 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]]. The Pirates were heavily favored as they had won the NL pennant by six and a half games. Aided by the modified chants of &quot;[[Tessie]]&quot; by the [[Royal Rooters]] [[fan club]] and by its stronger pitching staff, the Americans managed to overcome the odds, and win the best-of-nine series five games to three.

[[File:WorldSeries1903-640.jpg|250px|left|thumb|Iconic photo of the Huntington Avenue Grounds before the first modern World Series game]]
The [[1904 Boston Americans season|1904 club]] was almost as good as the previous team, but due to the surprise emergence of the [[1904 New York Highlanders season|New York Highlanders]], the Boston club found itself in a tight pennant race through the last games of the season. A predecessor to what would become a storied rivalry, this race featured such controversial moves as the trade of Patsy Dougherty to the Highlanders for [[Bob Unglaub]]. The climax of the season occurred on the last, dramatic doubleheader at the Highlanders' home stadium, [[Hilltop Park]]. In order to win the pennant, the Highlanders needed to win both games. With [[Jack Chesbro]], the Highlanders' 41-game winner, on the mound, and the score tied 2–2 with a man on third in the top of the ninth, a spitball got away from Chesbro and [[Lou Criger]] scored the go-ahead run on one of the most famous wild pitches in history.

[[File:Huntington Avenue Grounds.jpg|250px|right|thumb|The Huntington Avenue Grounds during a game. Note building from which the famous 1903 &quot;bird's-eye&quot; photo was taken.]]
Unfortunately, the NL champion [[1904 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] declined to play any [[1904 World Series|postseason series]], fearing it would give their New York rivals credibility (they had expected the Highlanders to win), but a sharp public reaction led the two leagues immediately to make the World Series a permanent championship, starting in {{by|1905}}. These successful times soon ended, however, as [[1906 Boston Americans season|Boston]] lost 100 games in {{by|1906}}. However, several new star players helped the newly renamed Red Sox improve almost immediately.

[[File:Boston Americans season pass, 1906.jpg|250px|left|thumb|A season pass for the 1906 season.]]
By {{by|1909}}, legendary [[center fielder]] [[Tris Speaker]] had become a fixture in the Boston outfield, and the team worked their way to third place. However, the Red Sox would not win the pennant again until their 105-win {{by|1912}} [[1912 Major League Baseball season|season]], finishing with a club record .691 [[winning percentage]]. Anchored by an outfield considered to be among the finest in the game—Tris Speaker, [[Harry Hooper]] and [[Duffy Lewis]]—and superstar pitcher [[Smoky Joe Wood]], the Red Sox beat the New York Giants 4–3–1 in the classic [[1912 World Series]] best known for [[Snodgrass's Muff]]. From {{by|1913}} to {{by|1916}} the Red Sox were owned by [[Joseph Lannin]], who signed [[Babe Ruth]], soon the best-known and one of the best players ever. Another 101 wins in {{by|1915}} propelled the [[1915 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] to the [[1915 World Series]], where they beat the [[1915 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] four games to one. Following the {{by|1915}} season, Tris Speaker was traded to the [[Cleveland Indians]]. His departure was more than compensated for, however, by the emergence of star pitcher Babe Ruth. The [[1916 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] went on to win the [[1916 World Series]], this time defeating the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Robins]]. In {{by|1918}}, Babe Ruth led his team to another [[1918 World Series|World Series]] championship, this time over the [[1918 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]].

=== Sale of Babe Ruth and Aftermath (1920–38) ===
[[File:Babe Ruth pitching.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Ruth pitching for the Red Sox in 1914, at [[Comiskey Park]] in Chicago]]
[[Harry Frazee]] bought the Red Sox from Joseph Lannin in {{by|1916}} for about $500,000. A couple of notable trades involving Harry Frazee and the Yankees occurred before the Babe Ruth sale. On December 18, 1918, outstanding outfielder [[Duffy Lewis]], pitcher [[Dutch Leonard (left-handed pitcher)|Dutch Leonard]] (who had posted a modern record 0.96 ERA in 1914&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/l/leonadu01.shtml|title=Dutch Leonard Statistics&amp;nbsp;— Baseball-Reference.com|author=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=February 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and pitcher [[Ernie Shore]] were traded to the Yankees for pitcher [[Ray Caldwell]], [[Slim Love]], [[Roxy Walters]], [[Frank Gilhooley]] and $15,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/L/Lewis_Duffy.stm |title=Duffy Lewis |publisher=BaseballLibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; As all three players were well regarded in Boston—Lewis had been a key player on the 1910s championship teams, Shore had famously relieved Babe Ruth and retired 27 straight, and Leonard had only four years before setting a modern record for earned run average—this trade was regarded as a poor one in Boston. Then, on July 13, 1919, submarine-style pitching star [[Carl Mays]] was traded to the Yankees for Bob McGraw, Allan Russell and $40,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/M/Mays_Carl.stm |title=Carl Mays |publisher=BaseballLibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mays would go on to have several good years for the Yankees, but had been a discipline problem for the Red Sox.

On December 26, 1919,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frazee sold Babe Ruth, who had played the previous six seasons for the Red Sox, to the rival New York Yankees (Ruth had just broken the single-season home run record, hitting 29 in {{by|1919}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/HR_leagues.shtml |title=Year-by-Year League Leaders &amp; Records for Home Runs — |publisher=Baseball-reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Legend has it that Frazee did so in order to finance the [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] play ''[[No, No, Nanette]]''. That play did not actually open on Broadway until {{by|1925}}, but as Leigh Montville discovered during research for his book, ''The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Montville|first=Leigh|title=The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth |publisher=Random House |year=2006 |pages=161–64|authorlink=Leigh Montville}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''No, No, Nanette'' had originated as a non-musical stage play called ''My Lady Friends'', which opened on Broadway in December 1919. ''My Lady Friends'' had, indeed, been financed by the Ruth sale to the Yankees.

During that period, the Red Sox, Yankees and [[Chicago White Sox]] had a détente; they were called &quot;Insurrectos&quot; because their actions antagonized league president Ban Johnson. Although Frazee owned the Boston Red Sox franchise, he did not own Fenway Park (it was owned by the Fenway Park Trust), making his ownership a precarious one; Johnson could move another team into the ballpark. His club was in debt, but Frazee felt the need to purchase its playing site (which he did in {{by|1920}}). Further, providing the Yankees with a [[box office]] attraction would help that mediocre club, which had sided with him against Johnson and &quot;the Loyal Five&quot; clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/s/2002/0718/1407265.html |title=ESPN.com: MLB — When the Yankees nearly moved to Boston |publisher=Static.espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Ruth was considered a serious disciplinary problem, a reputation he amply confirmed while playing for the Yankees. Frazee moved Ruth to stabilize Red Sox finances and cut distractions. It was a straight sale, no players in return.

New York achieved great success after acquiring Ruth and several other very good players. The sale of Babe Ruth came to be viewed as the beginning of the [[Yankees–Red Sox rivalry]], considered the &quot;Greatest Rivalry on Earth&quot; by American sports journalists.&lt;ref name=&quot;FierceRivalry&quot;/&gt;

After deciding to get out of baseball, Frazee began selling many of his star players. In the winter of 1920, [[Wally Schang]], [[Waite Hoyt]], [[Harry Harper]] and Mike McNally were traded to the Yankees for [[Del Pratt]], [[Muddy Ruel]], John Costello, Hank Thormahlen, Sammy Vick and cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/S/Schang_Wally.stm |title=Wally Schang&amp;#124;BaseballLibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1921 in baseball|following winter]], iron man [[shortstop]] [[Everett Scott]], and pitchers [[Bullet Joe Bush]] and [[Sad Sam Jones]] were traded to the Yankees for [[Roger Peckinpaugh]] (who would be immediately shipped to the [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]]), [[Jack Quinn (baseball)|Jack Quinn]], [[Rip Collins (pitcher)|Rip Collins]], Bill Piercy and $50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/S/Scott_Everett.stm |title=Everett Scott &amp;#124; BaseballLibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 23, {{by|1922}}, [[Joe Dugan]] and [[Elmer Smith (baseball outfielder, born 1892)|Elmer Smith]] were traded to the Yankees for Elmer Miller, Chick Fewster, [[Johnny Mitchell (baseball)|Johnny Mitchell]], and [[Lefty O'Doul]], who was at the time a mediocre pitching prospect. Acquiring Dugan helped the Yankees edge the [[1922 St. Louis Browns season|St. Louis Browns]] in a tight pennant race, and the resulting uproar helped create a June 15 trading deadline that went into effect the next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/baseballlibrary/ballplayers/S/Smith_Elmer309.stm |title=Elmer Smith &amp;#124; BaseballLibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps an even more outrageous deal was the trade of [[Herb Pennock]], occurring in early {{by|1923}}. Pennock was traded by the Red Sox to the Yankees for Camp Skinner, Norm McMillan, [[George Murray (baseball)|George Murray]] and $50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/p/pennohe01.shtml#TRANS |title=Herb Pennock Statistics — |publisher=Baseball-reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The loss of so much talent sent the Red Sox into free fall, even with the money Frazee earned from the trades. During the 1920s and early 1930s, they were fixtures in the second division, never finishing closer than 20 games out of first. The losses only mounted when Frazee sold the team to [[Bob Quinn (baseball)|Bob Quinn]] in 1923. During an eight-year period from {{by|1925}} to {{by|1932}}, the Red Sox averaged over 100 losses per season, bottoming out in 1932 with a record of 43-111, still the worst record in franchise history. One of the few bright spots on these teams was [[Earl Webb]], who set the all-time mark for most doubles in a season in {{by|1931}} with 67. The BoSox' fortunes began to change in {{by|1933}} when [[Tom Yawkey]] bought the team. Yawkey acquired pitcher [[Wes Ferrell]] and one of the greatest pitchers of all-time, [[Lefty Grove]], making his team competitive once again in the late thirties. He also acquired [[Joe Cronin]], an outstanding shortstop and manager and slugging [[first baseman]] [[Jimmie Foxx]] whose 50 home runs in 1938 would stand as a club record for 68 years. Foxx also drove in a club record 175 runs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/f/foxxji01.shtml|title=Jimmie Foxx Statistics&amp;nbsp;— Baseball-Reference.com |author=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=February 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1939–1960: Williams Era ===

In {{by|1939}}, the Red Sox purchased the contract of [[outfielder]] [[Ted Williams]] from the minor league [[San Diego Padres (PCL)|San Diego Padres]] of the [[Pacific Coast League]], ushering in an era of the team sometimes called the &quot;Ted Sox.&quot; Williams consistently hit for both high power and high average, and is generally considered one of the greatest hitters of all time. The right-field bullpens in Fenway were built in part for Williams' [[left-handed]] swing, and are sometimes called &quot;Williamsburg.&quot; Before this addition, it was over {{convert|400|ft|m}} to right field. He served two stints in the [[United States Marine Corps]] as a pilot and saw [[active duty]] in both World War II and the [[Korean War]], missing at least five full seasons of baseball. His book ''The Science of Hitting'' is widely read by students of baseball. He is currently the last player to hit over .400 for a full season, batting .406 in {{by|1941}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/w/willite01.shtml |title=Ted Williams Statistics — |publisher=Baseball-reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams feuded with sports writers his whole career, calling them &quot;The Knights of the Keyboard&quot;, and his relationship with the fans was often rocky as he was seen spitting towards the stands on more than one occasion.
[[File:Tedwilliams pic.jpg|thumb|[[Ted Williams]] with [[Tom Yawkey]].]]
With Williams, the Red Sox reached the [[1946 World Series]], but lost to the [[1946 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in seven games in part because of the use of the &quot;Williams Shift&quot;, a defensive tactic in which the shortstop would move to the right side of the infield to make it harder for the left-handed-hitting Williams to hit to that side of the field. Some have claimed that he was too proud to hit to the other side of the field, not wanting to let the Cardinals take away his game. His performance may have also been affected by a pitch he took in the elbow in an exhibition game a few days earlier. Either way, in his only World Series, Williams gathered just five singles in 25 [[At bat|at-bats]] for a .200 average.

The Cardinals won the {{by|1946}} Series when [[Enos Slaughter]] scored the go-ahead run all the way from first base on a [[Hit (baseball)|base hit]] to left field. The throw from [[Leon Culberson]] was cut off by shortstop [[Johnny Pesky]], who relayed the ball to the plate just a hair too late. Some say Pesky hesitated or &quot;held the ball&quot; before he turned to throw the ball, but this has been disputed.

Along with Williams and Pesky, the Red Sox featured several other star players during the 1940s, including second baseman [[Bobby Doerr]] and center fielder [[Dom DiMaggio]] (the younger brother of [[Joe DiMaggio]]).

The Red Sox narrowly lost the AL pennant in {{by|1948}} and {{by|1949}}. In [[1948 Major League Baseball season|1948]], [[1948 Boston Red Sox season|Boston]] finished in a tie with [[1948 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland]], and their loss to Cleveland in a [[one-game playoff]] ended hopes of an all-Boston World Series. Curiously, manager [[Joe McCarthy (manager)|Joseph McCarthy]] chose journeyman [[Denny Galehouse]] to start the playoff game when the young lefty phenom [[Mel Parnell]] was available to pitch. In [[1949 Major League Baseball season|1949]], the [[1949 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] were one game ahead of the [[1949 New York Yankees season|New York Yankees]], with the only two games left for both teams being against each other, and they lost both of those games.

[[File:ALE-BOS-Logo-Old09.png|thumb|150px|Logo used by the Boston Red Sox in the 1950s]]The 1950s were viewed as a time of tribulation for the Red Sox. After Williams returned from the Korean War in {{by|1953}}, many of the best players from the late 1940s had retired or been traded. The stark contrast in the team led critics to call the Red Sox' daily lineup &quot;Ted Williams and the Seven Dwarfs.&quot; [[Jackie Robinson]] was even worked out by the team at Fenway Park, however it appeared that owner Tom Yawkey did not want an African American player on his team at that time. [[Willie Mays]] also tried out for Boston and was highly praised by team scouts. Ted Williams hit .388 at the age of 38 in {{by|1957}}, but there was little else for Boston fans to root for. Williams retired at the end of the {{by|1960}} [[1960 Major League Baseball season|season]], famously hitting a home run in his final at-bat as memorialized in the [[John Updike]] story &quot;Hub fans bid Kid adieu.&quot; The Red Sox finally became the last Major League team to field an [[African American]] player when they promoted [[infielder]] [[Pumpsie Green]] from their AAA [[farm system|farm team]] in {{by|1959}}.

=== 1960s ===
{{Main|The Impossible Dream (1967)}}
&lt;!--No Source Information: [[File:Carl_yastrzemski.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Carl &quot;Yaz&quot; Yastrzemski]]--&gt;
The 1960s also started poorly for the Red Sox, though 1961 saw the debut of [[Carl Yastrzemski|Carl &quot;Yaz&quot; Yastrzemski]], Williams' replacement in left field, who developed into one of the better hitters of a pitching-rich decade.

Red Sox fans know {{by|1967}} as the [[1967 Boston Red Sox season|season]] of the &quot;Impossible Dream.&quot; The slogan refers to the hit song from the popular [[Musical theatre|musical play]] &quot;[[Man of La Mancha]]&quot;. [[1967 Major League Baseball season|1967]] saw one of the great pennant races in [[History of baseball|baseball history]] with four teams in the AL pennant race until almost the last game. The BoSox had finished the {{by|1966}} [[1966 Major League Baseball season|season]] in ninth place, but they found new life with Yastrzemski as the team went to the [[1967 World Series]], only to lose the Series to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in seven games. Yastrzemski won the American League Triple Crown (the most recent player to accomplish such a feat until Miguel Cabrera did so in 2012), hitting .326 with 44 [[home run]]s and 121 RBIs. He finished one vote short of a unanimous MVP selection, as a Minnesota sportswriter placed Twins center fielder [[César Tovar]] first on his ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/y/yastrca01.shtml |title=Carl Yastrzemski Statistics&amp;nbsp;— Baseball-Reference.com|author=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=February 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the Red Sox lost the series—again to the St. Louis Cardinals, in seven games. Legendary pitcher [[Bob Gibson]] stymied the Red Sox winning three games.

An 18-year-old Bostonian rookie named [[Tony Conigliaro]] slugged 24 home runs in {{by|1964}}. &quot;Tony C&quot; became the youngest player in Major League Baseball to hit his 100th home run, a record that stands today. He was struck just above the left [[Zygomatic bone|cheek bone]] by a fastball thrown by [[Jack Hamilton (baseball)|Jack Hamilton]] of the [[1967 California Angels season|California Angels]] on Friday, August 18, {{by|1967}} and sat out the entire next season with headaches and blurred vision. Although he did have a productive season in {{by|1970}}, he was never the same.

=== 1970s ===
[[File:ALE-BOS-Logo-Old10.png|thumb|150px|1960–1978 logo]]
Although the Red Sox were competitive for much of the late 1960s and early 1970s, they never finished higher than second place in their division. The closest they came to a divisional title was {{by|1972}}, when they lost by a half-game to the [[1972 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]]. The start of the season was delayed by a players' strike, and the Red Sox had lost one more game to the strike than the Tigers had. Games lost to the strike were not made up. The Red Sox went to Detroit with a half-game lead for the final series of the season, but lost the first two of those three and were eliminated from the pennant race.

==== 1975 ====

The Red Sox won the AL pennant in {{by|1975}}. The [[1975 Boston Red Sox season|1975 Red Sox]] were as colorful as they were talented, with Yastrzemski and rookie outfielders [[Jim Rice]] and [[Fred Lynn]], veteran outfielder [[Dwight Evans]], [[catcher]] [[Carlton Fisk]], and pitchers [[Luis Tiant]] and eccentric junkballer [[Bill Lee (left-handed pitcher)|Bill &quot;The Spaceman&quot; Lee]]. Fred Lynn won both the American League [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] award and the [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player|Most Valuable Player]] award, a feat which had never previously been accomplished, and was not duplicated until [[Ichiro Suzuki]] did it in {{by|2001}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/roy_rol.shtml |title=Rookie of the Year Awards &amp; Rolaids Relief Award Winners — |publisher=Baseball-reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;oezowb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/mvp_cya.shtml |title=Most Valuable Player MVP Awards &amp; Cy Young Awards Winners – |publisher=Baseball-reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1975 American League Championship Series]], the Red Sox swept the [[1975 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland A's]].

In the [[1975 World Series]], they faced the heavily favored [[1975 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]], also known as [[The Big Red Machine]]. Luis Tiant won games 1 and 4 of the World Series but after five games, the Red Sox trailed the series 3 games to 2. Game 6 at Fenway Park is considered among the greatest games in postseason history. Down 6–3 in the bottom of the eighth inning, Red Sox [[pinch hitter]] [[Bernie Carbo]] hit a three-run homer into the center field bleachers off Reds fireman [[Rawly Eastwick]] to tie the game. In the top of the eleventh inning, [[right fielder]] Dwight Evans made a spectacular catch of a [[Joe Morgan]] line drive and doubled [[Ken Griffey, Sr.|Ken Griffey]] at first base to preserve the tie. In the bottom of the twelfth inning, Carlton Fisk hit a deep fly ball which sliced towards the left field foul pole above the [[Green Monster]]. As the ball sailed into the night, Fisk waved his arms frantically towards fair territory, seemingly pleading with the ball not to go foul. The ball complied, and bedlam ensued at Fenway as Fisk rounded the bases to win the game for the Red Sox 7–6.

The Red Sox lost game 7, 4–3 even though they had an early 3–0 lead. Starting pitcher Bill Lee threw a slow looping curve which he called a &quot;Leephus pitch&quot; or &quot;space ball&quot; to Reds first baseman [[Tony Pérez]] who hit the ball over the Green Monster and across the street. The Reds scored the winning run in the 9th inning. Carlton Fisk said famously about the 1975 World Series, &quot;We won that thing 3 games to 4.&quot;

==== 1978 pennant race ====
In {{by|1978}}, the Red Sox and the Yankees were involved in a tight pennant race. The Yankees were {{frac|14|1|2}} [[games behind]] the Red Sox in July, and on September 10, after completing a 4-game sweep of the Red Sox (known as &quot;The Boston Massacre&quot;), the Yankees tied for the divisional lead.

On September 16 the Yankees held a {{frac|3|1|2}} game lead over the Red Sox, but the Sox won 11 of their next 13 games and by the final day of the season, the Yankees' magic number to win the division was one—with a win over Cleveland or a Boston loss to the [[1978 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]] clinching the division. However, [[1978 New York Yankees season|New York]] lost 9–2 and Boston won 5–0, forcing a one-game playoff to be held at Fenway Park on Monday, October 2.

The most remembered moment from the game was [[Bucky Dent]]'s 7th inning three-run home run in off Mike Torrez just over the Green Monster, giving the Yankees their first lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|1990|pp=145–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reggie Jackson]] provided a solo home run in the 8th that proved to be the difference in the Yankees' 5–4 win, which ended with Yastrzemski popping out to [[Graig Nettles]] in foul territory with [[Rick Burleson]] representing the tying run at third. Although Dent became a Red Sox demon, the Red Sox would get retribution in 1990 when the Yankees fired Dent as their manager during a series at Fenway Park.&lt;ref name=BuckyDent&gt;{{cite news|title=Dent Dumped by Yankees|date=June 7, 1990|first=Nick|last=Cafardo|newspaper=The Boston Globe|page=37|url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/61640175.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun+7%2C+1990&amp;author=Nick+Cafardo%2C+Globe+Staff&amp;pub=Boston+Globe+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=37&amp;desc=DENT+DUMPED+BY+YANKEES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1980s ===
[[File:ALE-BOS-Logo.svg|thumb|150px|1979–2008 logo]]
Carl Yastrzemski retired after the {{by|1983}} season, during which the [[1983 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] finished sixth in the seven-team AL East, posting their worst record since {{by|1966}}.

==== 1986 ====
{{Main|1986 World Series}}
However, in {{by|1986}}, it appeared that the team's fortunes were about to change. The offense had remained strong with Jim Rice, Dwight Evans, [[Don Baylor]] and [[Wade Boggs]]. [[Roger Clemens]] led the pitching staff, going 24–4 with a 2.48 [[Earned run average|ERA]], and had a 20-strikeout game&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/c/clemero02.shtml|title=Roger Clemens Statistics&amp;nbsp;— Baseball-Reference.com|author=Baseball-Reference.com|accessdate=February 17, 2008|work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to win both the [[American League]] [[Cy Young Award|Cy Young]] and Most Valuable Player awards. Clemens became the first starting pitcher to win both awards since [[Vida Blue]] in {{by|1971}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;oezowb&quot; /&gt;

The [[1986 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] won the AL East for the first time in 11 seasons, and faced the [[1986 California Angels season|California Angels]] in the [[1986 American League Championship Series|AL Championship Series]]. The teams split the first two games in Boston, but the Angels won the next two home games, taking a 3–1 lead in the series. With the Angels poised to win the series, the Red Sox trailed 5–2 heading into the ninth inning of Game 5. A two-run homer by Baylor cut the lead to one. With two outs and a runner on, and one strike away from elimination, [[Dave Henderson]] homered off [[Donnie Moore]] to put Boston up 6–5. Although the Angels tied the game in the bottom of the ninth, the Red Sox won in the 11th on a Henderson sacrifice fly off Moore. The Red Sox then found themselves with six- and seven-run wins at Fenway Park in Games 6 and 7 to win the American League title.
[[Image:Billbuckner.jpg|thumb|Buckner watches his misplayed ground ball as Wilson goes to first.]]
The Red Sox faced a heavily favored [[1986 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] team that had won 108 games in the regular season in the [[1986 World Series]]. Boston won the first two games in [[Shea Stadium]] but lost the next two at Fenway, knotting the series at 2 games apiece. After [[Bruce Hurst]] recorded his second victory of the series in Game 5, the Red Sox returned to [[Shea Stadium]] looking to garner their first championship in 68 years. However, Game 6 would go down as one of the most devastating losses in club history. After pitching seven strong innings, Clemens was lifted from the game with a 3–2 lead. Years later, Manager [[John McNamara (baseball)|John McNamara]] said Clemens was suffering from a blister and asked to be taken out of the game, a claim Clemens denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://proxy.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?id=1206543|title=ESPN.com: Page 2: Is Clemens the Antichrist?|work=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mets then scored a run off [[relief pitcher|reliever]] and former Met [[Calvin Schiraldi]] to tie the score 3–3. The game went to extra innings, where the Red Sox took a 5–3 lead in the top of the 10th on a solo home run by Henderson, a double by Boggs and an RBI single by second baseman [[Marty Barrett (second baseman)|Marty Barrett]].

After recording two outs in the bottom of the 10th, a graphic appeared on the [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC telecast]] hailing Barrett as the Player of the Game, and Bruce Hurst had been named World Series MVP. A message even appeared briefly on the Shea Stadium scoreboard congratulating the Red Sox as world champions. After so many years of abject frustration, Red Sox fans around the world could taste victory. With the count at two balls and one strike, Mets catcher [[Gary Carter]] hit a single. It was followed by singles by [[Kevin Mitchell (baseball)|Kevin Mitchell]] and [[Ray Knight]]. With [[Mookie Wilson]] batting, a wild pitch by [[Bob Stanley]] tied the game at 5. Wilson then hit a slow ground ball to first; the ball rolled through [[Bill Buckner]]'s legs, allowing Knight to score the winning run from second.

While Buckner was singled out as responsible for the loss, many observers—as well as both Wilson and Buckner—have noted that even if Buckner had fielded the ball cleanly, the speedy Wilson probably would still have been safe, leaving the game-winning run at third with two out.

Many observers questioned why Buckner was in the game at that point considering he had bad knees and that [[Dave Stapleton (infielder)|Dave Stapleton]] had come in as a late-inning defensive replacement in prior series games. It appeared as though McNamara was trying to reward Buckner for his long and illustrious career by leaving him in the game. After falling behind 3–0, the Mets then won Game 7, concluding the devastating collapse and feeding the myth that the Red Sox were &quot;cursed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=SPORTS OF THE TIMES; Babe Ruth Curse Strikes Again|date=October 28, 1986|first=George|last=Vecsey|work=The New York Times|page=D33|authorlink=George Vecsey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This World Series loss had a strange twist: Red Sox General Manager [[Lou Gorman]] was vice-president, player personnel, of the Mets from 1980 to 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gorman&quot;/&gt; Working under Mets' GM [[Frank Cashen]], with whom Gorman served with the Orioles, he helped lay the foundation for the Mets' championship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gorman&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/02/sports/baseball/02gorman.html|title=Lou Gorman, Whose Red Sox Lost to Mets, Dies at 82|date=April 2, 2011|first=Bruce|last=Weber|newspaper=New York Times|page=B8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1988–1991 ===
The [[1988 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] returned to the postseason in {{mlby|1988}}. With the club in fourth place midway through the 1988 season at the All-Star break, manager John McNamara was fired and replaced by [[Joe Morgan (manager)|Joe Morgan]] on July 15. Immediately the club won 12 games in a row, and 19 of 20 overall, to surge to the AL East title in what would be referred to as ''Morgan Magic''. But the magic was short-lived, as the team was swept by the [[1988 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] in the [[1988 American League Championship Series|ALCS]]. Ironically, the MVP of that Series was former Red Sox pitcher and Baseball Hall of Fame player [[Dennis Eckersley]], who saved all four wins for Oakland. Two years later, in {{mlby|1990}}, the [[1990 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] would again win the division and face the [[1990 Oakland Athletics season|Athletics]] in the [[1990 American League Championship Series|ALCS]]. However, the outcome was the same, with the A's sweeping the ALCS in four straight.

In 1990, Yankees fans started to chant &quot;1918!&quot; to taunt the Red Sox.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Pennant Chases in East Still Flying High, West All but Flagged|date=September 25, 1990|first=Mark|last=Maske|work=The Washington Post|page=E3|quote=Yankees fans had taunted the Red Sox all weekend with chants of &quot;1918, 1918!&quot;—the last time Boston won the World Series—and the Red Sox are not allowed by long-suffering New Englanders to forget the pain they have wrought with years of excruciating near misses.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demeaning chant would echo at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] each time the Red Sox were there.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Fenway Park became the scene of [[Bucky Dent]]'s worst moment as a manager, although it was where he had his greatest triumph.&lt;ref name=BuckyDent/&gt; In June, when the Red Sox swept the Yankees during a four-game series at Fenway Park, the Yankees fired Dent as their manager. Red Sox fans felt retribution to Dent being fired on their field, but the Yankees used him as a scapegoat.&lt;ref name=BuckyDent/&gt; However, [[Dan Shaughnessy]] of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' severely criticized Yankees Owner [[George Steinbrenner]] for firing Dent—his 18th managerial change in as many years since becoming owner—in Boston and said he should &quot;have waited until the Yankees got to Baltimore&quot; to fire Dent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dent-Shaughnessy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=His Back Was Against the Wall|date=June 7, 1990|first=Dan|last=Shaughnessy|newspaper=The Boston Globe|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that &quot;if Dent had been fired in Seattle or Milwaukee, this would have been just another event in an endless line of George's jettisons. But it happened in Boston and the nightly news had its hook.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dent-Shaughnessy&quot;/&gt; &quot;The firing was only special because&amp;nbsp;... it's the first time a Yankee manager—who was also a Red Sox demon—was purged on the ancient Indian burial grounds of the Back Bay.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dent-Shaughnessy&quot;/&gt;

=== 1992–2001 ===
[[Image:Green Monster 2001.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Red Sox hosting a home game against the Atlanta Braves in July 2001.]]
Tom Yawkey died in {{by|1976}}, and his wife [[Jean R. Yawkey]] took control of the team until her death in {{by|1992}}. Their initials are shown in two stripes on the [[Green Monster|left field wall]] in [[Morse code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/bos/ballpark/facts.jsp |title=The Official Site of The Boston Red Sox: Ballpark: Fenway Facts |publisher=Boston.redsox.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Jean's death, control of the team passed to the Yawkey Trust, led by [[John Harrington (Red Sox CEO)|John Harrington]]. The trust sold the team in 2002, concluding 70 years of Yawkey ownership.

In {{by|1994}}, General Manager [[Lou Gorman]] was replaced by [[Dan Duquette]], a Massachusetts native who had worked for the [[Montreal Expos]]. Duquette revived the team's [[minor league baseball|farm system]], which during his tenure produced players such as [[Nomar Garciaparra]], [[Carl Pavano]] and [[David Eckstein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/e/eckstda01.shtml |title=David Eckstein Statistics — |publisher=Baseball-reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duquette also spent money on free agents, notably an eight-year, $160 million deal for [[Manny Ramírez]] after the {{by|2000}} [[2000 Major League Baseball season|season]].

The [[1995 Boston Red Sox season|Red Sox]] won the newly realigned [[American League East]] in {{by|1995}}, finishing seven games ahead of the [[1995 New York Yankees season|Yankees]]. However, they were swept in three games in the [[1995 American League Division Series|ALDS]] by the [[1995 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]]. Their postseason losing streak reached 13 straight games, dating back to the 1986 World Series.

Roger Clemens tied his major league record by fanning 20 [[1996 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] on September 18, {{by|1996}} in what would prove to be one of his final appearances in a Red Sox uniform. After Clemens had turned 30 and then had four seasons, 1993–96, which were by his standards mediocre at best, Duquette said the pitcher was entering &quot;the twilight of his career&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insider.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/story?columnist=crasnick_jerry&amp;id=2124180&amp;CMP=OTC-DT9705204233&amp;action=login&amp;appRedirect=http%3a%2f%2finsider.espn.go.com%2fmlb%2fcolumns%2fstory%3fcolumnist%3dcrasnick_jerry%26id%3d2124180%26CMP%3dOTC-DT9705204233 |title=Clemens putting Cooperstown on hold}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clemens went on to pitch well for another ten years and win four more Cy Young awards.

Out of contention in {{by|1997}}, the team traded closer [[Heathcliff Slocumb]] to Seattle for catching prospect [[Jason Varitek]] and right-handed pitcher [[Derek Lowe]]. Prior to the start of the {{by|1998}} [[1998 Major League Baseball season|season]], the Red Sox dealt pitchers [[Tony Armas, Jr.]] and Carl Pavano to the Montreal Expos for pitcher [[Pedro Martínez]]. Martínez became the anchor of the team's pitching staff and turned in several outstanding seasons. In 1998, the [[1998 Boston Red Sox season|team]] won the American League [[MLB Wild Card|Wild Card]], but again lost the [[1998 American League Division Series|American League Division Series]] to the [[1998 Cleveland Indians season|Indians]].

In {{by|1999}}, Duquette called Fenway Park &quot;economically obsolete&quot; and, along with Red Sox ownership, led a push for a new stadium.

On the field, the [[1999 Boston Red Sox season|1999 Red Sox]] were finally able to overturn their fortunes against the Indians. [[1999 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland]] took a 2–0 series lead, but Boston won the next three games behind strong pitching by Derek Lowe, Pedro Martínez and his brother [[Ramón Martínez (pitcher)|Ramón Martínez]]. Game 4's 23–7 win by the Red Sox was the highest-scoring playoff game in major league history. Game 5 began with the Indians taking a 5–2 lead after two innings, but Pedro Martínez, nursing a shoulder injury, came on in the fourth inning and pitched six innings without allowing a hit while the team's offense rallied for a 12–8 win behind two home runs and seven RBIs from outfielder [[Troy O'Leary]]. After the ALDS victory, the Red Sox lost the [[1999 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]] to the Yankees, four games to one. The one bright spot was a lopsided win for the Red Sox in the much-hyped Martinez-Clemens game.

=== 2002–present: John Henry era ===

==== 2002–03 ====
{{Main|2002 Boston Red Sox season|2003 Boston Red Sox season}}
In {{by|2002}}, the Red Sox were sold by Yawkey trustee and president Harrington to [[New England Sports Ventures]], a consortium headed by principal owner [[John Henry (baseball)|John Henry]]. [[Tom Werner]] served as executive chairman, [[Larry Lucchino]] served as president and CEO, and serving as vice chairman was [[Les Otten]]. [[Dan Duquette]] was fired as GM of the club on February 28, with former Angels GM [[Mike Port]] taking the helm for the [[2002 Major League Baseball season|2002 season]]. A week later, manager [[Joe Kerrigan]] was fired and was replaced by [[Grady Little]].

While nearly all offseason moves were made under Duquette, such as signing outfielder [[Johnny Damon]] away from the [[Oakland Athletics]], the new ownership made additions such as outfielder [[Cliff Floyd]] and relief pitcher [[Alan Embree]]. Nomar Garciaparra, Manny Ramírez, and Floyd all hit well, while Pedro Martínez put up his usual outstanding numbers. Derek Lowe, newly converted into a starter, won 20 games—becoming the first player to save 20 games and win 20 games in back-to-back seasons.

After failing to reach the playoffs, Port was replaced by [[Yale University]] graduate [[Theo Epstein]]. Epstein, raised in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], and just 28 at the time of his hiring, became the youngest general manager in MLB history.

The [[2003 Boston Red Sox season|2003 team]] was known as the &quot;Cowboy Up&quot; team, a nickname derived from first baseman [[Kevin Millar]]'s challenge to his teammates to show more determination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cowboyup&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2003/09/24/rallying_cry_spurs_sox_to_finish_ride/|work=Boston Globe|date=September 24, 2003|title=Rallying Cry Spurs Sox To Finish Ride|first=Joseph P.|last=Kahn}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[2003 American League Division Series]], the Red Sox rallied from a 0–2 series deficit against the [[2003 Oakland Athletics season|Athletics]] to win the best-of-five series. Derek Lowe returned to his former relief pitching role to save Game 5, a 4–3 victory. The team then faced the [[2003 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] in the [[2003 American League Championship Series]]. In Game 7, Boston led 5–2 in the eighth inning, but Pedro Martínez allowed three runs to tie the game. The Red Sox could not score off [[Mariano Rivera]] over the last three innings and eventually lost the game 6–5 when Yankee third baseman [[Aaron Boone]] hit a solo home run off of [[Tim Wakefield]]. Some placed the blame for the loss on manager Grady Little&lt;ref name=Gradyjob&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2003/10/23/little_unsure_he_wants_job/|title=Boston Globe, Little unsure he wants job|first=Gordon|last=Edes|date=23 October 2003|newspaper=The Boston Globe|authorlink=Gordon Edes}}&lt;/ref&gt; for failing to remove starting pitcher Martínez in the 8th inning after some observers believe he began to show signs of tiring. Others credited Little with the team's successful season and dramatic come-from-behind victory in the ALDS.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Nevertheless, Boston's management did not renew Little's contract, and hired former [[Philadelphia Phillies]] manager [[Terry Francona]].

==== &quot;The Idiots&quot;: 2004 World Series Championship ====
{{Main|2004 Boston Red Sox season|2004 American League Division Series|2004 American League Championship Series|2004 World Series}}
During the 2003–04 offseason, the Red Sox acquired another ace pitcher, [[Curt Schilling]], and a closer, [[Keith Foulke]]. Due to some midseason struggles with injuries, management shook up the team at the July 31 trading deadline as part of a four-team trade. The Red Sox traded the team's popular, yet oft-injured, shortstop [[Nomar Garciaparra]] and outfielder [[Matt Murton]] to the [[Chicago Cubs]], and received first baseman [[Doug Mientkiewicz]] from the [[Minnesota Twins]], and shortstop [[Orlando Cabrera]] from the [[Montreal Expos]]. In a separate transaction, the Red Sox acquired center fielder [[Dave Roberts (outfielder)|Dave Roberts]] from the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. Following the trades, the club won 22 out of 25 games and qualified for the playoffs as the AL Wild Card. Players and fans affectionately referred to the players as &quot;the Idiots&quot;, a term coined by Damon and Millar during the playoff push to describe the team's eclectic roster and devil-may-care attitude toward their supposed &quot;curse.&quot;

Boston began the postseason by sweeping the [[American League West|AL West]] champion [[2004 Anaheim Angels season|Anaheim Angels]] in the [[2004 American League Division Series|ALDS]]. In the third game of the series, David Ortiz hit a walk-off two-run homer in the 10th inning to win the game and the series to advance to a rematch of the previous year's ALCS in the [[2004 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] against the [[2004 New York Yankees season|Yankees]]. The ALCS started very poorly for the Red Sox, as they lost the first three games (including a crushing 19-8 home loss in game 3). In Game 4, the Red Sox found themselves facing elimination, trailing 4–3 in the ninth with [[Mariano Rivera]] in to close for the Yankees. After Rivera issued a walk to Millar, Roberts came on to pinch run and promptly stole second base. He then scored on an RBI single by [[Bill Mueller]], sending the game into extra innings. The Red Sox went on to win the game on a two-run home run by Ortiz in the 12th inning, who also made the walk-off hit in the 14th inning of game 5. The comeback continued with a victory from an injured Schilling in game 6. Three sutures being used to stabilize the tendon in Schilling's right ankle bled throughout the game, famously making his sock appear bloody red. The Red Sox completed their historic comeback in game 7 with a 10-3 defeat of the Yankees. Ortiz, who had the game-winning RBIs in Games 4 and 5, was named ALCS Most Valuable Player. The Red Sox joined the [[1941–42 Toronto Maple Leafs season|1942 Toronto Maple Leafs]] and [[1974–75 New York Islanders season|1975 New York Islanders]] as the only [[professional sports]] teams in history at the time to win a best-of-seven games series after being down three games to none. The [[2009–10 Philadelphia Flyers season|2009-10 Philadelphia Flyers]] (against the [[2009-10 Boston Bruins season|Boston Bruins]]) and the [[2013-14 Los Angeles Kings season|2013-14 Los Angeles Kings]] (against the [[2013-14 San Jose Sharks season|San Jose Sharks]]) would also accomplish the feat.

[[File:2004 WorldSeries Trophy.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The Commissioner's Trophy (2004 World Series)]] 
The Red Sox swept the [[2004 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] in the [[2004 World Series]]. The Red Sox never trailed throughout the series; [[Mark Bellhorn]]'s hit a game-winning home run off [[Pesky's Pole]] in game 1, and Schilling pitched another bloodied-sock victory in game 2, followed by similarly masterful pitching performances by Martinez and [[Derek Lowe]]. It was the Red Sox' first championship in 86 years. Manny Ramírez was named [[World Series MVP]]. To add a final, surreal touch to Boston's championship season, on the night of Game 4 a [[total lunar eclipse]] colored the moon red over [[Busch Memorial Stadium|Busch Stadium]]. The Red Sox earned many accolades from the sports media and throughout the nation for their incredible season, such as in December, when ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' named the Boston Red Sox the 2004 [[Sportsman of the Year|Sportsmen of the Year]].

==== 2005–06 ====
{{Main|2005 Boston Red Sox season|2006 Boston Red Sox season}}
The {{by|2005}} AL East would be decided on the last weekend of the season, with the [[2005 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] coming to Fenway Park with a one-game lead in the standings. The Red Sox won two of the three games to finish the season with the same record as the Yankees, 95–67. However, a playoff was not needed, as the loser of such a playoff would still make the playoffs as a Wild Card team. As the Yankees had won the season series, they were awarded the division title, and the Red Sox competed in the playoffs as the Wild Card. Boston failed to defend their championship, and was swept in three games by the eventual [[2005 World Series]] champion [[2005 Chicago White Sox season|Chicago White Sox]] in the [[2005 American League Division Series|first round]] of the playoffs. After the season, general manager [[Theo Epstein]] resigned rather than accept a contract extension.

[[Image:David Wells pitches wp.jpg|thumb|[[David Wells]] pitching for the Red Sox in 2006]]
In November 2005, the Red Sox announced the acquisition of pitcher [[Josh Beckett]] and third baseman [[Mike Lowell]] from the [[Florida Marlins]], while sending several prospects including [[Hanley Ramírez]] to the Marlins. Fan-favorite [[Johnny Damon]] signed a four-year, $52 million deal with the rival Yankees, whom he had earlier vowed never to play for.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The team filled the vacancy in center field by trading for Cleveland Indians center fielder [[Coco Crisp]]. However, Crisp fractured his left index finger in April and would end up missing over 50 games in {{by|2006}}. Meanwhile, in January 2006, Epstein came to terms with the Red Sox and was once again named General Manager.

The revamped Red Sox infield, with third baseman Lowell joining new shortstop [[Álex González (shortstop, born 1977)|Álex González]], second baseman [[Mark Loretta]], and first baseman [[Kevin Youkilis]] (formerly the team's third baseman) was one of the best-fielding infields in baseball.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} The Red Sox committed the fewest errors in the American League in [[2006 Major League Baseball season|2006]], and set a major league record of 17 consecutive errorless games. One of the brightest spots of the 2006 season was the emergence of new closer [[Jonathan Papelbon]], who became the first Red Sox rookie to be credited with 35 saves, earning an [[2006 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] appearance. Also, [[David Ortiz]] broke [[Jimmie Foxx]]'s single season Red Sox home run record by hitting 54 homers. However, Boston failed to make the playoffs after compiling a 9–21 record in the month of August due to injuries to catcher [[Jason Varitek]], outfielder [[Trot Nixon]], outfielder [[Manny Ramírez]], pitcher [[Tim Wakefield]], rookie pitcher [[Jon Lester]] (who was diagnosed with [[lymphoma]]), and pitcher [[Matt Clement]]. The Red Sox failed to make the playoffs as a result.

[[File:Red Sox 2007.jpg|200px|right|thumb|2007 season final standing]]
Theo Epstein's first step toward restocking the team for {{by|2007}} was to pursue one of the most anticipated acquisitions in baseball history. On November 14, MLB announced that Boston had won the bid for the rights to negotiate a contract with Japanese [[Nippon Professional Baseball]] superstar pitcher [[Daisuke Matsuzaka]]. Boston placed a bid of $51.1 million to negotiate with Matsuzaka and completed a 6-year, $52 million contract after they were announced as the winning bid.

The Red Sox moved into first place in the AL East by mid-April and never relinquished their division lead. Initially, rookie second baseman [[Dustin Pedroia]] under-performed, hitting below .200 in April. Manager [[Terry Francona]] refused to bench him and his patience paid off as Pedroia eventually won the [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|AL Rookie of the Year Award]] for his performance that season, which included 165 hits and a .317 batting average. On the mound, [[Josh Beckett]] emerged as the ace of the staff with his first 20-win season, as fellow starting pitchers Schilling, Matsuzaka, Wakefield and [[Julian Tavarez]] all struggled at times. Relief pitcher [[Hideki Okajima]], another recent arrival from the NPB, posted an ERA of 0.88 through the first half and was selected for the All-Star Game. Okajima finished the season with a 2.22 ERA and 5 saves, emerging as one of baseball's top relievers. Minor league call-up [[Clay Buchholz]] provided a spark on September 1 by pitching a [[no-hitter]] in his second career start. The Red Sox captured their first AL East title since 1995.

[[File:Boston Red Sox George W. Bush.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Victorious Red Sox players being honored at the [[White House]] by President [[George W. Bush]].]]
The Red Sox swept the [[2007 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Angels]] in the [[2007 American League Division Series|ALDS]]. Facing the [[2007 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] in the [[2007 American League Championship Series|ALCS]], the Red Sox fell in games 2, 3, and 4 before Beckett picked up his second victory of the series in game 5, starting a comeback. The Red Sox captured their twelfth American League pennant by outscoring the Indians 30–5 over the final three games. The Red Sox faced the [[2007 Colorado Rockies season|Colorado Rockies]] in the [[2007 World Series]], and swept the Rockies in four games. In Game 4, Wakefield gave up his spot in the rotation to a recovered [[Jon Lester]], who gave the Red Sox an impressive start, pitching 5⅔ shutout innings. Key home runs late in the game by third baseman [[Mike Lowell]] and pinch-hitter [[Bobby Kielty]] secured the Red Sox' second title in four years, as Lowell was named World Series MVP.

==== 2008–2012: Injuries and Collapses ====
{{overly detailed|section=yes|date=September 2014}}
{{Main|2008 Boston Red Sox season|2009 Boston Red Sox season|2010 Boston Red Sox season|2011 Boston Red Sox season|2012 Boston Red Sox season}}
The Red Sox struggled with injuries throughout the 2008 season. Injuries to Schilling, relief pitcher [[Mike Timlin]], and Beckett landed each pitcher on the disabled list before the 2008 season began, putting added pressure on young starters Lester and Buchholz. Lester emerged as an anchor in the Red Sox rotation, leading the team in starts and innings pitched while compiling a 16–6 record and a 3.21 ERA. Buchholz meanwhile struggled mightily in 2008 to a 2–9 record, ending up back in the minor leagues. The Red Sox began their season by participating in the third opening day game in MLB history to be played in Japan, where they defeated the [[2008 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland A's]] in the [[Tokyo Dome]]. On May 19, Lester threw the 18th no-hitter in team history, defeating the [[2008 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City Royals]] 7–0. However, despite early Red Sox success, the surprise [[2008 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]] led the AL East in early July. Injuries would take a toll on the Red Sox offense during the season, most notably when [[David Ortiz]] missed 45 games with an injured wrist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shroyer|first=Shawn|url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080907&amp;content_id=3433116&amp;vkey=news_bos&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=bos|title=Wrist still giving Big Papi some trouble|work=MLB.com|publisher=redsox.com|date=September 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Lowell missed weeks with a torn hip labrum, and outfielder [[J.D. Drew]] aggravated a back injury that shelved him for much of the second half of the season. Down the stretch, outfielder [[Manny Ramirez]] became embroiled in controversy surrounding public incidents with fellow players and other team employees, as well as criticism of ownership and not playing, which some claimed was due to laziness and nonexistent injuries. The front office decided to move the disgrunted outfielder at the July 31 trade deadline, shipping him to the Dodgers in a three-way deal with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] that landed them [[Jason Bay]] to replace him in left field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Shaughnessy|first=Dan|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2008/08/01/going_going_gone/|title=Going, going, gone|publisher=The Boston Globe|date=August 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Ramirez gone, and Bay providing a new spark in the lineup, the Red Sox improved vastly and made the playoffs as the AL Wild Card. Ramirez ended up with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].

Behind the strong playoff pitching of Lester, the Red Sox defeated the [[2008 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Angels]] in the [[2008 American League Division Series|2008 ALDS]] three games to one. The Red Sox then took on their AL East rivals the [[2008 Tampa Bay Rays season|Tampa Bay Rays]] in the [[2008 American League Championship Series|ALCS]]. Down three games to one in the 5th game of the ALCS, Boston mounted a comeback from trailing 7-0 in the 7th inning to win 8-7.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=281016102 |title=Drew's game-winning hit keeps Red Sox alive in ALCS|agency=[[Associated Press]] |publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=October 16, 2008|accessdate=October 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=17alcs&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/17/sports/baseball/17alcs.html?_r=1&amp;ref=sports&amp;pagewanted=print|title=Down by 7–0, Red Sox Force a Game 6|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=October 17, 2008|first=Jack|last=Curry|authorlink=Jack Curry|date=October 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They tied the series at 3 games apiece with a game 6 victory before losing game 7, 3–1, thus becoming the eighth team in a row since 2000 to fail to repeat as world champions.

In response to poor offensive performance and to make room for [[Jed Lowrie]]'s return from injury, shortstop [[Julio Lugo]] was traded to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] for cash and two minor-league players were traded to the Pirates for first baseman [[Adam LaRoche]] on July 22, who was soon traded to the [[Atlanta Braves]] for [[Casey Kotchman]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sports.espn.go.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/team/transactions/_/name/bos/year/2009/boston-red-sox |title=Boston Red Sox Transactions |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Red Sox made a big move at the July 31 trade deadline, acquiring catcher [[Victor Martinez (baseball)|Victor Martinez]] from the [[Cleveland Indians]] for three pitchers.&lt;ref name=&quot;sports.espn.go.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4369463 |title=Red Sox deal three for Victor Martinez |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2009-08-01 |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Sox lost the last six games of the 2009 season to place the team second in the AL East, with the Yankees (who would later win the [[2009 World Series|World Series]]). The Red Sox entered the playoffs via the Wild Card, but were swept by the [[2009 Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim season|Los Angeles Angels]] in three games.

[[File:Daniel Nava on July 15, 2010.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Daniel Nava]] in 2010]]
The Red Sox' 2010 season was highlighted by its many injuries to its players despite new additions to the team such as starting pitcher [[John Lackey]], outfielder [[Mike Cameron]] and infielder [[Marco Scutaro]]. Matsuzaka, Pedroia, and Youkilis ended the season early to recover their health, and Ellsbury spent most of the season on the bench due to injuries. The Red Sox missed the playoffs for the first time since 2006, finishing in third place in the AL East. After the season, Lowell decided to retire.

The Red Sox acquired superstar first baseman [[Adrian Gonzalez]] in a trade with the [[San Diego Padres]] and signed speedy outfielder [[Carl Crawford]] as an attempt to help the team return to the playoffs. Entering the 2011 season, expectations were sky high and some baseball analysts even went as far as comparing the 2011 Red Sox to the legendary [[1927 New York Yankees season|1927 Yankees]]. Despite the positive preseason predictions, the Red Sox struggled early in 2011, falling to an 0-6 start for the first time since 1945. However, they gradually made their way into playoff contention by July, thanks to a potent offense which made up for a decimated pitching staff. Matsuzaka and Buchholz ended their season with injuries, while new additions such as [[Andrew Miller (baseball)|Andrew Miller]], [[Alfredo Aceves]] and relief pitcher [[Daniel Bard]] proved their worth filling in for injured pitchers. After rookie pitcher [[Kyle Weiland]] proved ineffective, the Red Sox made a three-way trade, giving up some prospects for [[Érik Bédard]]. Due to further injuries in September, the Red Sox lost 11 out of 14 in that month, and their postseason aspirations were ultimately destroyed on [[Wild Card Wednesday|September 28, 2011]], losing to the Orioles by a score of 4–3 while the Rays clinched the American League Wild Card with a win over the Yankees on the same night. The Red Sox missed the playoffs in consecutive seasons for the first time since missing three straight postseasons from 2000 to 2002. Following the season, the Red Sox declined to exercise Terry Francona's 2012 contract option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/boston/mlb/story/_/id/7040260/terry-francona-boston-red-sox-part-ways-two-titles|title=Terry Francona, Red Sox split|date=September 30, 2011|accessdate=October 1, 2011|first=Joe|last=McDonald|work=ESPNBoston.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2011/09/30/ignore-spin-red-sox-fired-terry-francona/Gu52pzZWWw8Af4iQ49WH7L/story.xml|title=Ignore the spin – Red Sox fired Francona|date=October 1, 2011|accessdate=October 1, 2011|first=Dan|last=Shaughnessy|newspaper=The Boston Globe|page=A1|authorlink=Dan Shaughnessy}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the season, there was much controversy when it was claimed that the clubhouse didn't have solid leadership. On some days, starting pitchers Lackey, Beckett, and Lester spent time in the dugout drinking. Lester and the rest of the responsible pitchers stressed that they were only drinking when they had the day off pitching. After the tumultuous end of the season, Theo Epstein left for the [[Chicago Cubs]] and was replaced by his previous assistant, [[Ben Cherington]].

In December 2011, [[Bobby Valentine]] was hired as a new manager. At about the same time, longtime closer Papelbon signed with the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] rather than re-sign with the Red Sox. The 2012 season marked the centennial of [[Fenway Park]], and on April 20, past and present Red Sox players and coaches assembled to celebrate the park's anniversary. However, the collapse that they endured in September 2011 carried over into the season. The Red Sox struggled throughout the season due to injuries, inconsistent play, and off-field news. Many attempts to better the team through trades and free agent signing failed. Amidst rumors that Valentine and Youkilis were not getting along, the Red Sox traded Youkilis to the [[Chicago White Sox]] on June 24. On August 25, the Red Sox sent struggling players Gonzalez, Beckett, Crawford and infielder [[Nick Punto]] to the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] for [[James Loney (baseball)|James Loney]] and four minor league prospects. In addition to the clubhouse drinking, Beckett was also heavily connected to another incident where some of the players attended his charity [[bowling]] game rather than the funeral for [[Johnny Pesky]], a longtime Red Sox shortstop, manager, and coach who died on August 13. Coupled with a bizarre and inconsistent season, the one-time ace became a pariah to Red Sox Nation. The Red Sox, realizing that the postseason was not in reach, decided to build with talent from their minor league system. Over the next few months, minor league callups [[Will Middlebrooks]], [[Pedro Ciriaco]], [[Ryan Lavarnway]] and [[Daniel Nava]] were making regular appearances for the Red Sox. The Red Sox finished 69–93 for their first losing season since 1997, and their worst season since 1965.

Bobby Valentine was subsequently fired on October 4, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/extras/extra_bases/2012/10/valentine_seems.html |title=Bobby Valentine seems relieved after being fired - Extra Bases - Red Sox blog |publisher=Boston.com |date=2012-10-04 |accessdate=2013-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Valentine has been replaced by [[John Farrell (pitcher)|John Farrell]], who had spent the previous two seasons as manager of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]. Farrell was the pitching coach for the Red Sox from 2007&amp;ndash;2010 before becoming manager of the Blue Jays.

Mlb.com retrieved from http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20130920&amp;content_id=61186228&lt;/ref&gt;  But there were other moves made in the offseason by general manager [[Ben Cherington]] who targeted &quot;character&quot; players to fill the team's needs. These acquisitions included veteran catcher [[David Ross (baseball)|David Ross]], [[Jonny Gomes]], [[Mike Napoli]], and [[Shane Victorino]]. While some questioned these players as &quot;re-treads&quot;, it was clear that Cherington was trying to move past 2011–2012 by bringing in &quot;clubhouse players&quot;. Essential to the turn around, however, was the pitching staff. With ace veteran [[John Lackey]] coming off [[Tommy John surgery]] and both Jon Lester and [[Clay Buchholz]] returning to their prior form, this allowed the team to rely less on their bullpen. Everything seemed in danger of collapsing, however, when both [[closer (baseball)|closers]], [[Joel Hanrahan]] and [[Andrew Bailey (baseball)|Andrew Bailey]], went down early with season-ending injuries. Farrell gave the closing job to [[Koji Uehara]] on June 21 who delivered with a 1.09 ERA and an MLB record 0.565 [[Walks plus hits per inning pitched|WHIP]].&lt;ref&gt;The Uehara Phenomenon http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/10/18/the-uehara-phenomenon/&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 11, the 37-year-old right-hander set a new Red Sox record when he retired 33 straight batters.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, I.

[[File:B Strong badge.png|100px|right|thumb|Patch worn by the Boston Red Sox in memory of Boston Marathon bombing victims]]
Throughout the season, the Red Sox players and organization formed a close association with the city of [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] and its people in relation to the [[Boston Marathon bombings]] that occurred on April 15, 2013. On April 20, the day after the alleged bombers were captured, David Ortiz gave a pre-game speech following a ceremony honoring the victims and the local law enforcement, in which he stated, &quot;This is our fucking city! And nobody is going to dictate our freedom! Stay strong!&quot;. For the entirety of the season, the team wore an additional arm patch that exhibited the Red Sox &quot;B&quot; logo and the word &quot;Strong&quot; within a blue circle. The team also hung up in the [[dugout (baseball)|dugout]] a custom jersey that read &quot;Boston Strong&quot; with the number 617, representing the city of Boston's [[area code]]. On many occasions during the season, victims of the attack and law enforcement involved were given the honor of throwing the ceremonial [[first pitch]]. Following their victory in the 2013 World Series, the first one clinched at home in Fenway Park since 1918, Red Sox players Jonny Gomes and Jarrod Saltalamacchia performed a ceremony during the team's traditional [[duck tour|duck boat]] victory [[parade]], in which they placed the [[World Series trophy]] and the custom 617 jersey on the [[Boston Marathon]] finish line on [[Boylston Street]], followed by a moment of silence and a singing of [[God Bless America]]. This ceremony helped the city &quot;reclaim&quot; its spirit that was lost after the bombing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/02/us/boston-red-sox-parade/ | title = Boston Red Sox parade reclaims marathon finish line | publisher = [[CNN]] | date = November 2, 2013 | accessdate = November 7, 2013 | first = Michael | last = Martinez }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, the Red Sox team and organization played a role in the healing process after the tragedy, owing to the team's unifying effect on the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moroney|first=Tom and Linskey, Annie|title=Red Sox Homage to April Bomb Victims Drives World Series Win|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-31/red-sox-homage-to-april-bomb-victims-drives-world-series-win.html|accessdate=December 26, 2013|newspaper=Bloomberg News|date=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Karlamangla|first=Soumya|title=Boston celebrates Red Sox win, remembers marathon bombings|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/nov/02/nation/la-na-nn-boston-red-sox-marathon-20131102|accessdate=December 26, 2013|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boston fans converge on bombing site|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/mlb/story/boston-strong-red-sox-fans-celebrate-marathon-finish-line-after-world-series-game-6-win-st-louis-cardinals-fenway-park-103013|accessdate=December 26, 2013|newspaper=Fox Sports|date=October 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Martinez|first=Michael|title=Saturday's Boston Red Sox victory parade to heal city's marathon wounds|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/10/31/us/boston-red-sox-win-meaning/|accessdate=December 26, 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=November 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2014 season ====
{{main|2014 Boston Red Sox season}}
Gone from Boston's roster were core 2013 players such as center fielder [[Jacoby Ellsbury]], catcher [[Jarrod Saltalamacchia]], and pitcher [[Ryan Dempster]]. To help replace their needs, the Red Sox added catcher [[A. J. Pierzynski]], and outfielder [[Grady Sizemore]], while also calling up young stars, outfielder [[Jackie Bradley, Jr.|Jackie Bradley Jr.]], and third baseman [[Xander Bogaerts]]. During the season, the Red Sox struggled and released a number of veteran players including Sizemore, Pierzynski, and [[Chris Capuano]] while promoting top prospects such as [[Christian Vazquez]] and [[Mookie Betts]]. At the end of July, the Red Sox traded away a number of members of the 2013 team: [[Felix Doubront]], [[Jake Peavy]], [[John Lackey]], [[Jonny Gomes]], [[Stephen Drew]], and [[Jon Lester]]. On September 10, the Red Sox were officially eliminated from the postseason, marking the fourth time in five seasons they did not qualify for the playoffs despite winning the World Series in the one year they did.

===Truck Day===
The unofficial beginning of the spring training season for the Red Sox is Truck Day, the day a tractor-trailer filled with equipment leaves Fenway Park bound for the Sox spring training facility in Florida. Truck Day 2014 took place on Saturday, February 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/extras/extra_bases/2014/02/truck_day_kicks_off_spring_training.html|title=Truck Day Kicks Off Spring Training|accessdate=February 10, 2014 | work=The Boston Globe|date=February 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===City of Palms Park===
Former [[left fielder]] [[Mike Greenwell]] is from [[Fort Myers, Florida]] and was instrumental in bringing his team to the city for [[spring training]]. [[City of Palms Park]] was built in {{by|1992}} for that purpose and holds 8,000 people. It is also the home of the Red Sox Rookie team, the [[Gulf Coast League Red Sox]], from April through June.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

===JetBlue Park===

On October 28, 2008, the Lee County commission voted 3–1 to approve an agreement with the Boston Red Sox to build a new spring-training facility for the team in south Lee County. Commissioner Brian Bigelow was the lone dissenting vote. Commissioner Bob Janes was not present for the vote, but stated that he supported it.

Dee was present in the chambers for the vote, and took the agreement back to Boston to meet with John Henry and other team officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news-press.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2008810280398|title=Lee County commissioners approve Red Sox agreement|accessdate=October 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 1, 2008, the Red Sox signed an agreement with Lee County that will keep their spring training home in the Fort Myers area for 30 more years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsline.com/mlb/story/11076748|title=Red Sox to stay in Fort Myers for 30 more springs|accessdate=November 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wednesday, April 30, 2009, the Lee County commissioners selected the Watermen-Pinnacle site on Daniels Parkway (a little more than a mile east of Interstate 75) as the site for the new facility. The backup choice, if negotiations between county staff and the developer falter, is the University Highland site just north of [[Germain Arena]] in [[Estero]]. Jeff Mudgett, a Fort Myers architect who is volunteering his time toward the project, envisions a facility with a mini-[[Fenway Park]] that would open for Spring 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news-press.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2009904300348|title=Red Sox home in Lee County will be on Daniels Parkway|accessdate=May 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 29, 2011, it was announced that the new field would be named [[JetBlue Park]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news-press.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2011103300387|title=JetBlue puts stamp on Red Sox Complex|accessdate=2011-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Fenway South. The park was named JetBlue Park after [[JetBlue Airlines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edes |first=Gordon |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/boston/red-sox/post/_/id/9145/sox-new-facility-to-be-named-jet-blue-park |title=Sox new facility to be named JetBlue Park - Boston Red Sox Blog - ESPN Boston |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has maintained major operations at Boston's [[Logan International Airport]] since 2004.

Many characteristics of the stadium will be taken from [[Fenway Park]], including a {{convert|37|ft|m|sing=on}} [[Green Monster]] wall in left field, featuring seating on top of and behind the wall. Included in the wall will be a restored version of the manual scoreboard that was housed at Fenway for almost 30 years, beginning in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boston&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/extras/extra_bases/2011/08/red_sox_announc_8.html|title=Red Sox announce spring training ticket prices at new JetBlue Park|accessdate=2011-10-07 | work=The Boston Globe|first=Peter|last=Abraham|date=August 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field dimensions at JetBlue Park will be identical to those at Fenway.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boston&quot;/&gt;

==Rivalry with the Yankees==
{{main|Yankees–Red Sox rivalry}}
The Yankees–Red Sox rivalry is one of the oldest, most famous and fiercest [[List of sports rivalries|rivalries in professional sport]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;FierceRivalry&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;StrongestRivalry&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=UltimateRivalry/&gt; For over 100 years, the Red Sox and [[New York Yankees]] have been rivals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enemies&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/playoffs/2004-10-11-cover-rivalry_x.htm|title=Here they go again&amp;nbsp;... ; Red Sox vs. Yankees: Bitter enemies clash with Series on line|date=October 12, 2004|accessdate=January 27, 2011|first=Mike|last=Dodd|newspaper=USA Today|page=1C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rivalry is often a heated subject of conversation in the [[Northeastern United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shaughnessy|2005|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the inception of the [[Major League Baseball Wild Card|wild card]] team and an added Division Series, every playoffs has featured one or both of the [[American League East]] rivals and they both have squared off in the [[American League Championship Series]] three times, with the Yankees winning twice in [[1999 American League Championship Series|1999]] and [[2003 American League Championship Series|2003]] and the Sox winning in [[2004 American League Championship Series|2004]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ALCS&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=They Love to Hate Each Other; Red Sox and Yankees carry bitter rivalry into championship series that starts tonight|date=October 12, 2004|first=Mike|last=DiGiovanna|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|page=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A World Series ticket; Sox complete comeback, oust Yankees for AL title|date=October 21, 2004|first=Dan|last=Shaughnessy|newspaper=The Boston Globe|page=A1|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2004/10/21/a_world_series_party/?page=full}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the teams have twice met in the last regular-season series of a season to decide the league title, in {{mlby|1904}} (when the Red Sox won) and {{mlby|1949}} (when the Yankees won).&lt;ref name=&quot;ALCS&quot;/&gt;

The teams also finished tied for first in {{mlby|1978}}, when the Yankees won a high-profile [[1978 American League East tie-breaker game|one-game playoff]] for the division title.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|pp=177&amp;ndash;179}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1978 division race is memorable for the Red Sox having held a 14-game lead over the Yankees more than halfway through the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Frommer|Frommer|2004|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the 2004 AL Championship Series is notable for the Yankees leading 3 games to 0 and ultimately losing a best of seven series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Back From Dead, Red Sox Bury Yanks and Go to Series|first=Tyler|last=Kepner|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 21, 2004|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Sox comeback was the only time in baseball history that a team has come back from a 0&amp;ndash;3 deficit to win a series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bruins' fall brings back memories of 2004|last=Rieber|first=Anthony|newspaper=Newsday|date=May 16, 2010|page=68|quote=The 2004 Yankees&amp;nbsp;... are the only baseball team in history to lead a postseason series 3&amp;ndash;0 and not win it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio and television==
{{See also|List of Boston Red Sox broadcasters}}
Currently, the [[flagship station|flagship]] [[radio station]] of the Red Sox is [[WEEI]], 850 AM. [[Joe Castiglione]], in his 25th year as the voice of the Red Sox, serves as the lead [[play-by-play]] announcer, along with [[Dave O'Brien (sportscaster)|Dave O'Brien]] and [[Jon Rish]]. Some of Castiglione's predecessors include [[Curt Gowdy]], [[Ken Coleman]], and [[Ned Martin]]. He has also worked with play-by-play veterans Bob Starr and [[Jerry Trupiano]]. Many stations throughout [[New England]] and beyond pick up the broadcasts.

All Red Sox telecasts not shown nationally on [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]] or [[ESPN Major League Baseball|ESPN]] are seen on [[New England Sports Network]] (NESN) with [[Don Orsillo]] calling play-by-play and [[Jerry Remy]], former Red Sox [[second baseman]], as [[color analyst]]. During Remy's recovery from cancer, former Red Sox players [[Dennis Eckersley]] and [[Dave Roberts (outfielder)|Dave Roberts]] have alternated doing color commentary. NESN became exclusive in 2006; before then, games were shown on such local stations as [[WHDH-TV (defunct)|the original WHDH-TV]], [[WHDH (TV)|WNAC-TV]] (now the current WHDH), [[WBZ-TV]], [[WSBK-TV]], [[WLVI]], [[WBPX|WABU]], and [[WFXT]] at various points in team history.

===Other platforms===
The widespread growth of mobile devices and [[social media]] have cause the Red Sox to expand its team update information into other platforms. Some off-air news updates via social media take place including on:  [[Facebook]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Facebook|RedSox|Red Sox}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Google+]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Google+|+RedSox}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Twitter|RedSox|@RedSox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retired numbers==

The Red Sox previously had a requirement that the player &quot;must have finished their career with Red Sox&quot;, but this was reconsidered after the election of Carlton Fisk to the Hall of Fame. Fisk actually retired with the White Sox, but then-GM Dan Duquette hired him for one day as a special assistant, which allowed Fisk to technically end his career with the Red Sox.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Grossman|first=Leigh|title=The Red Sox Fan Handbook|publisher=Swordsmith Books|year=2001|page=208| isbn=1-931013-03-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, with the anticipation that there might be other former Red Sox players who would be denied the chance to have their number retired by the club (prime examples include Roger Clemens and Wade Boggs), the team dropped the rule.&lt;br&gt;Some would argue that the 3rd rule still exists ''de facto'', as Boggs' number 26 has not been retired (nor withheld from circulation) by Boston even though he meets the 2 official requirements (Boggs finished his career with the [[Tampa Bay Rays]] after spending five years with the [[Yankees–Red Sox rivalry|rival]] [[New York Yankees]]). But the Red Sox, who inducted Boggs into their team Hall of Fame in 2004, won't retire his number. &quot;They told me there's criteria,&quot; Boggs said to the Boston Globe. &quot;You have to end your career as a Red Sox.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/2013/04/09/wade-boggs-buys-into-field-dreams-and-dreams-retired-number-fenway/RYaF0q0DXUd6A348sIBo3I/story.html|title=Number hangup|date=April 9, 2013|first=Stan|last=Grossfield|work=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only exception that has been made to date is for former Boston shortstop [[Johnny Pesky]], whose number 6 was retired on September 28, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bostonherald.com/sports/baseball/red_sox/view/2008_09_29_Lofty_position_for_Johnny_Pesky:_Exclusive_place_for_Sox__No__6/srvc=home&amp;position=also|title=Lofty position for Johnny Pesky|date=September 29, 2008|first=Steve|last=Buckley|work=Boston Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pesky neither spent ten years as a player nor was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame; however, Red Sox ownership cited &quot;...&amp;nbsp;his versatility of his contributions—on the field, off the field, [and] in the dugout&amp;nbsp;...&quot;, including as a manager, scout, and special instructor and decided that the honor had been well-earned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2008/09/24/pesky_makes_honor_roll?mode=PF|title=Pesky makes honor roll|date=September 24, 2008|work=Boston Globe|first=Michael|last=Vega}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number 42 was officially retired by [[Major League Baseball]] in {{mlby|1997}}, but [[Mo Vaughn]] was one of a handful of players to continue wearing #42 through a [[grandfather clause]]. He last wore it for the team in {{mlby|1998}}. In commemoration of Jackie Robinson Day, MLB invited players to wear the number 42 for games played on April 15, [[Coco Crisp]] (CF), [[David Ortiz]] (DH), and [[DeMarlo Hale]] (Coach) did that in 2007 and again in 2008. Starting in 2009, MLB had all uniformed players for all teams wear #42 for Jackie Robinson Day.

* 33: '''[[Jason Varitek]] C (1997–2011)'''; retired as member of Red Sox.
* 45: '''[[Pedro Martínez]] RHP (1998–2004)'''.
* 49: '''[[Tim Wakefield]] RHP (1995–2011)'''; retired as member of Red Sox.
Although elected into Baseball's Hall of Fame, Martinez would not qualify to have their uniform number retired based on the above &quot;10 year&quot; policy. 

There has also been debate in Boston media circles and among fans about the potential retiring of [[Tony Conigliaro]]'s number '''25'''.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}  Nonetheless, since Conigliaro's last full season in Boston, 1970, the number has been assigned to 15 individuals, including players [[Orlando Cepeda]], [[Mark Clear]], [[Don Baylor]], [[Larry Parrish]], [[Jack Clark (baseball)|Jack Clark]], [[Troy O'Leary]], [[Jeremy Giambi]] and [[Mike Lowell]]; coach [[Dwight Evans]], and manager [[Bobby Valentine]]. #25 is currently worn by OF [[Jackie Bradley, Jr.]]

Until the late 1990s, the numbers originally hung on the right-field facade in the order in which they were retired: 9–4–1–8. It was pointed out that the numbers, when read as a date (9/4/18), marked the eve of the first game of the [[1918 World Series]], the last championship series that the Red Sox won before 2004. After the facade was repainted, the numbers were rearranged in numerical order. In 2012, the numbers were rearranged again in chronological order of retirement (9,4,1,8,27,6,14) followed by Robinson's 42.

==Other notable seasons and team records==
{{main|List of Boston Red Sox team records}}
*[[Nomar Garciaparra]] hit .372 in 2000, the club record for a right-handed hitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/g/garcino01.shtml |title=Nomar Garciaparra Statistics&amp;nbsp;— Baseball-Reference.com|author=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=February 17, 2008 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*David Ortiz in 2005 had 47 home runs and 148 RBIs. He also had many game winning and timely hits and came in second in the MVP voting to the New York Yankees' Alex Rodriguez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/o/ortizda01.shtml |title=David Ortiz Statistics&amp;nbsp;— Baseball-Reference.com|author=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=February 17, 2008 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*David Ortiz had a franchise record-breaking 2006 season with 54 home runs in the regular season
*On April 22, 2007, Manny Ramírez, J. D. Drew, Mike Lowell, and Jason Varitek hit four consecutive home runs in the 3rd inning off 10 pitches from [[Chase Wright]] of the New York Yankees in his second Major League start and his fourth above Single-A ball. This was the fifth time in Major League history, and first time in Red Sox history this feat has occurred. Notable is that J. D. Drew had previously contributed to a four consecutive home run sequence on September 18, 2006 (coincidentally also the second batter in the sequence) while with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. Additionally, then-Red Sox manager Terry Francona's father, [[Tito Francona]], also was a part of such a four consecutive home run sequence for the [[Cleveland Indians]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20070422&amp;content_id=1925045&amp;vkey=news_bos&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=bos|title=Sox tie mark with four straight homers &lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;#124;&lt;/nowiki&gt; redsox.com: News|accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The overall regular season winning percentage since club inception in 1901 is .516, a record of 8595–8065 for games played through July 9, 2008. They started 2007 with winning percentage of 0.512 (8444–7960).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/ |title=Baseball Teams and Baseball Team Encyclopedias — |publisher=Baseball-reference.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On September 1, 2007, Clay Buchholz no-hit the [[2007 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]] in his second Major League start. He is the first Red Sox rookie and 17th Red Sox pitcher to throw a no-hitter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://insider.espn.go.com/espn/blog/index?entryID=3001530&amp;name=Neyer_Rob ESPN.com&amp;nbsp;— Blogs&amp;nbsp;— Rob Neyer Blog&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*On September 22, 2007, with a victory over the [[2007 Tampa Bay Devil Rays season|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]], the Red Sox clinched a spot in the postseason for the fourth time in five years, the first time in club history this has happened. Also, with this postseason berth, manager Terry Francona becomes the first manager in team history to lead the club to three playoff appearances.
*Between May 15, 2003 and April 10, 2013, the Red Sox sold out every home game. The 820 game streak is a record for all major American sports, narrowly passing the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] record of 814 between 1977 and 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/al/redsox/story/2012-04-19/Fenway-Park-100th-anniversary/54422780/1|newspaper=USA Today|title=Happy Birthday: Fenway Park turns 100 years old|date=April 20, 2012|first=Seth|last=Livingstone}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Edes|first=Gordon|title=Red Sox's sellout streak ends|url=http://espn.go.com/boston/mlb/story/_/id/9158007/boston-red-sox-820-game-sellout-streak-ends|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=November 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous major league baseball record had been held by the Cleveland Indians, who sold out 455 games between June 12, 1995 and April 2, 2001. (The team's definition of a sellout: &quot;The criteria used for a sellout at Fenway Park have been the same since the early 1990s&quot;, Kennedy said in an e-mail. &quot;Our policy is simple and straightforward, and is used by many MLB clubs &lt;nowiki&gt;[and other sports teams around the country]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. A sellout occurs when the number of tickets distributed to spectators is equal to or greater than the seating capacity at Fenway Park. &lt;nowiki&gt;[The 2008 seating capacity is 36,984 for day games and 37,400 for night games.]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080904&amp;content_id=3417965&amp;vkey=news_bos&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=bos&amp;partnerId=rss_bos|title=Red Sox to set MLB sellout record|accessdate=July 28, 2009|date=September 4, 2008|first=Ian|last=Browne|work=MLB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is: a sellout only covers ticket sales, not spectators in physical seats.)
*On May 21, 2011, the Red Sox played against the Chicago Cubs at Fenway Park for the first time since the 1918 World Series (they had faced each other at Chicago's Wrigley Field in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.retrosheet.org/boxesetc/2005/B06100CHN2005.htm|title=Chicago Cubs 14, Boston Red Sox 6|work=Retrosheet|publisher=Retrosheet.org|date=June 10, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
