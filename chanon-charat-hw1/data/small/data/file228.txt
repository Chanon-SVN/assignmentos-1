'''Ankara''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|ŋ|k|ə|r|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/ankara?showCookiePolicy=true|title=Ankara|accessdate=24 September 2014|publisher=Collins Dictionary|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-tr|ˈaŋ.ka.ɾa}}; historically known by the names '''Ancyra''' and '''Angora''') is the capital of [[Turkey]] and the country's [[List of largest cities and second largest cities by country|second largest]] [[List of cities in Turkey|city]], [[Istanbul]] being the largest. The city has a mean elevation of {{convert|sp=us|938|m|ft}} and in 2012 had a population of 4,338,620, with its [[metropolitan municipality]] having 4,965,542.&lt;ref name=&quot;Citypopulation.de - Turkey 2011&quot;&gt;[http://www.citypopulation.de/Turkey-RBC20.html#Stadt_gross Citypopulation.de – Turkey 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rapor.tuik.gov.tr&quot;&gt;[http://rapor.tuik.gov.tr/reports/rwservlet?adnksdb2&amp;ENVID=adnksdb2Env&amp;report=wa_buyukbelediye.RDF&amp;p_kod=1&amp;p_yil=2011&amp;p_dil=1&amp;desformat=html Türkiye İstatistik Kurumu (TÜİK) – Büyükşehir belediyeleri ve bağlı belediyelerin nüfusları – 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fallingrain.com/world/TU/68/Ankara.html Ankara, Turkey: Latitude, Longitude and Altitude]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the center of the [[Politics of Turkey|Turkish Government]], and an important commercial and industrial city. Located in [[Central Anatolia]], Ankara is an important crossroads of trade, strategically located at the center of Turkey's highway and railway networks, and serves as the marketing center for the surrounding agricultural area. The city is traditionally famed for its long-haired [[Angora goat]] and its prized wool ([[mohair]]), a unique breed of cat ([[Turkish Angora|Angora cat]]), [[Angora rabbit]]s and their prized [[Angora wool]], pears, honey, and the region's [[muscat (grape and wine)|muscat]] grapes.

The historical center of Ankara is situated upon a rocky hill, which rises {{convert|150|sp=us|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above the plain on the left bank of the ''Ankara Çayı'', a tributary of the [[Sakarya River|Sakarya]] (Sangarius) river. Although situated in one of the driest places of Turkey and surrounded mostly by steppe vegetation except for the forested areas on the southern periphery, Ankara can be considered a green city in terms of green areas per inhabitant, which is 72&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ankara.bel.tr/AbbSayfalari/hizmet_birimleri/Cevre/kisi_basina_dusen_yesil_alan.aspx|title=Municipality of Ankara: Green areas per head |publisher=Ankara.bel.tr |date=|accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ankara is a very old city with various [[Hittites|Hittite]], [[Phrygia]]n, [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[archaeological site]]s. The hill which overlooks the city is crowned by the ruins of the old castle, which adds to the picturesqueness of the view, but only a few historic structures surrounding the old citadel have survived to the present day. There are, however, many well-preserved remains of [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman]] and [[Roman architecture]], the most remarkable being the Temple of [[Augustus]] and Rome (20 BC) which is also known as the ''[[Monumentum Ancyranum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Augustus/Res_Gestae/home.html |title=LacusCurtius • Monumentum Ancyranum |publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu |date=|accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
As with many ancient cities, Ankara has gone by several names over the ages. It has been identified with the [[Hittites|Hittite]] cult center '''Ankuwaš''',&lt;!--or Ankuwa, but not Ankuwash--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;qgmpff&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialscience.tjc.edu/mkho/fulbright/1998/turkey/turman3.htm |title=Judy Turman: Early Christianity in Turkey |publisher=Socialscience.tjc.edu |date=|accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;xtxpyw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/seyahat/4407373_p.asp |title=Saffet Emre Tonguç: Ankara (Hürriyet Seyahat) |publisher=Hurriyet.com.tr |date=|accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this remains a matter of debate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gorny&quot;&gt;Gorny, Ronald L. &quot;Zippalanda and Ankuwa: The Geography of Central Anatolia in the Second Millennium B.C.&quot; ''The Journal of the American Oriental Society''. Vol. 117 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; In classical antiquity and during the medieval period, the city was known as {{lang|grc|'''Ἂγκυρα'''}} (''Ánkyra'' &quot;[[anchor]]&quot;) in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and '''Ancyra''' in [[Latin]]; the [[Galatian language|Galatian Celtic]] name was probably a similar variant. Following its annexation by the [[Seljuk Turks]] in 1073, the city became known in many European languages as '''Angora''', a usage which continued until its official international renaming to '''Ankara''' under the Turkish Postal Service Law of 28 March 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tore Kjeilen |url=http://i-cias.com/e.o/ankara.htm |title=Ankara |publisher=I-cias.com |date=3 September 2004 |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Ankara|Timeline of Ankara}}
[[File:MuseumOfAnatolianCivilizationsHittiteArtifacts.jpg|thumb|[[Hittites|Hittite]] artifacts on display at the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]], Ankara.]]

The region's history can be traced back to the [[Bronze Age]] [[Hattians|Hattic]] [[Hattic language|civilization]], which was succeeded in the 2nd millennium BC by the [[Hittites]], in the 10th century BC by the [[Phrygia]]ns, and later by the [[Lydia]]ns, [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]]ns, [[Greeks]], [[Galatia]]ns, [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], and [[Turkish people|Turks]] (the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] [[Sultanate of Rûm]], the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Turkey]].)

===Ancient history===
The oldest settlements in and around the city center of Ankara belonged to the [[Hattians|Hattic]] [[Hattic language|civilization]] which existed during the [[Bronze Age]] and was gradually absorbed ca. 2000–1700 BC by the [[Hittite language|Indo-European]] [[Hittites]]. The city grew significantly in size and importance under the [[Phrygia]]ns starting around 1000&amp;nbsp;BC, and experienced a large expansion following the mass migration from [[Gordium|Gordion]], (the capital of [[Phrygia]]), after an earthquake which severely damaged that city around that time. In Phrygian tradition, King [[Midas]] was venerated as the founder of Ancyra, but [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] mentions that the city was actually far older, which accords with present archaeological knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece, 1.4.1., &quot;Ancyra was actually older even than that.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;

Phrygian rule was succeeded first by [[Lydia]]n and later by [[Iran|Persia]]n rule, though the strongly Phrygian character of the peasantry remained, as evidenced by the gravestones of the much later Roman period. Persian sovereignty lasted until the Persians' defeat at the hands of [[Alexander the Great]] who conquered the city in 333 BC. Alexander came from [[Gordium|Gordion]] to Ankara and stayed in the city for a short period. After his death at [[Babylon]] in 323 BC and the subsequent division of his empire among his generals, Ankara and its environs fell into the share of [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus]].

Another important expansion took place under the Greeks of [[Pontus|Pontos]] who came there around 300 BC and developed the city as a trading center for the commerce of goods between the [[Black Sea]] ports and Crimea to the north; Assyria, Cyprus, and Lebanon to the south; and Georgia, Armenia and Persia to the east. By that time the city also took its name ''Áγκυρα'' (''Ànkyra'', meaning ''[[Anchor]]'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]) which, in slightly modified form, provides the modern name of ''Ankara''.

===Celtic history===
[[File:Dying gaul.jpg|thumb|The ''[[Dying Galatian]]'' was a famous statue commissioned some time between 230–220&amp;nbsp;BC by King [[Attalus I|Attalos I]] of [[Pergamon]] to honor his victory over the [[Celts|Celtic]] [[Galatia]]ns in [[Anatolia]]. Roman marble copy of a [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] work of the late 3rd century BC, at the [[Capitoline Museums]], Rome.]]

In 278 BC, the city, along with the rest of central Anatolia, was occupied by a [[Celts|Celt]]ic group, the [[Galatia]]ns, who were the first to make Ankara one of their main tribal centers, the headquarters of the [[Tectosages]] tribe. Other centers were [[Pessinus|Pessinos]], today's ''Balhisar'', for the [[Trocmi]] tribe, and [[Tavium]], to the east of Ankara, for the ''Tolstibogii'' tribe. The city was then known as ''Ancyra''. The Celtic element was probably relatively small in numbers; a warrior aristocracy which ruled over Phrygian-speaking peasants. However, the Celtic language continued to be spoken in Galatia for many centuries. At the end of the 4th century, [[Jerome|St. Jerome]], a native of Dalmatia, observed that the language spoken around Ankara was very similar to that being spoken in the northwest of the Roman world near [[Trier]].

===Roman history===
[[File:Galatia Map.png|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Ancyra was the capital of the [[Celts|Celt]]ic kingdom of [[Galatia]], and later of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province with the same name, after its conquest by [[Augustus]] in 25&amp;nbsp;BC.]]

The city was subsequently conquered by [[Augustus]] in 25 BC and passed under the control of the [[Roman Empire]]. Now the capital city of the Roman province of Galatia, Ancyra continued to be a center of great commercial importance. Ankara is also famous for the ''[[Monumentum Ancyranum]]'' (''Temple of Augustus and Rome'') which contains the official record of the ''Acts of Augustus'', known as the ''[[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]]'', an inscription cut in marble on the walls of this temple. The ruins of Ancyra still furnish today valuable [[relief|bas-relief]]s, inscriptions and other architectural fragments.

Augustus decided to make Ancyra one of three main administrative centers in central Anatolia. The town was then populated by Phrygians and Celts—the ''Galatians'' who spoke a language somewhat closely related to [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]]. Ancyra was the center of a tribe known as the ''Tectosages'', and Augustus upgraded it into a major provincial capital for his empire. Two other Galatian tribal centers, [[Tavium]] near [[Yozgat]], and [[Pessinus]] (Balhisar) to the west, near Sivrihisar, continued to be reasonably important settlements in the Roman period, but it was Ancyra that grew into a grand metropolis.

[[File:Res Gestae.jpg|thumb|The [[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res Gestae]] is the self-laudatory autobiography completed in 13 AD, just before his death, by the first [[Roman emperor]] [[Augustus]]. Most of the text is preserved in the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]].]]
[[File:AnkaraRomanBaths1.jpg|thumb|The [[Roman Baths of Ankara]] were constructed by the Roman emperor [[Caracalla]] (212–217) in honor of [[Asclepios]], the God of Medicine, and built around three principal rooms: the ''[[caldarium]]'' (hot bath), the ''[[tepidarium]]'' (warm bath) and the ''[[frigidarium]]'' (cold bath) in a typically laid-out 80m x 120m classical complex.]]

An estimated 200,000 people lived in Ancyra in good times during the Roman Empire, a far greater number than was to be the case from after the fall of the Roman Empire until the early 20th century. A small river, the [[Ankara River|Ankara Çayı]], ran through the center of the Roman town. It has now been covered and diverted, but it formed the northern boundary of the old town during the Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman periods. Çankaya, the rim of the majestic hill to the south of the present city center, stood well outside the Roman city, but may have been a summer resort. In the 19th century, the remains of at least one [[Roman villa]] or large house were still standing not far from where the Çankaya Presidential Residence stands today. To the west, the Roman city extended until the area of the Gençlik Park and Railway Station, while on the southern side of the hill, it may have extended downwards as far as the site presently occupied by [[Hacettepe University]]. It was thus a sizeable city by any standards and much larger than the Roman towns of [[Gaul]] or [[Britannia]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Ancyra's importance rested on the fact that it was the junction point where the roads in northern Anatolia running north-south and east-west intersected. The great imperial road running east passed through Ankara and a succession of emperors and their armies came this way. They were not the only ones to use the Roman highway network, which was equally convenient for invaders. In the second half of the 3rd century, Ancyra was invaded in rapid succession by the [[Goths]] coming from the west (who rode far into the heart of [[Cappadocia]], taking slaves and pillaging) and later by the [[Arab people|Arab]]s. For about a decade, the town was one of the western outposts of one of the most brilliant queens of the ancient world, the Arab empress [[Zenobia]] from [[Palmyra]] in the [[Syrian Desert]], who took advantage of a period of weakness and disorder in the Roman Empire to set up a short-lived state of her own.

The town was reincorporated into the Roman Empire under Emperor [[Aurelian]] in 272. The [[tetrarchy]], a system of multiple (up to four) emperors introduced by [[Diocletian]] (284–305), seems to have engaged in a substantial programme of rebuilding and of road construction from Ankara westwards to Germe and [[Dorylaeum]] (now [[Eskişehir]]).

In its heyday, Roman Ankara was a large market and trading center but it also functioned as a major administrative capital, where a high official ruled from the city's Praetorium, a large administrative palace or office. During the 3rd century, life in Ancyra, as in other Anatolian towns, seems to have become somewhat militarized in response to the invasions and instability of the town. In this period, like other cities of central Anatolia,

== Christianity ==

Early Christian martyrs of Ancyra, about whom little is known, included Proklos and Hilarios who were natives of the otherwise unknown nearby village of Kallippi, and suffered repression under the emperor [[Trajan]] (98–117). In the 280s we hear of Philumenos, a Christian corn merchant from southern Anatolia, being captured and martyred in Ankara, and Eustathius.

[[File:Teodot Ankirski.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Theodotus of Ancyra (martyr)|St. Theodotus of Ancyra]]]]

As in other Roman towns, the reign of [[Diocletian]] marked the culmination of the persecution of the Christians. In 303, Ancyra was one of the towns where the co-Emperors Diocletian and his deputy [[Galerius]] launched their anti-Christian persecution. In Ancyra, their first target was the 38-year-old Bishop of the town, whose name was Clement. Clement's life describes how he was taken to Rome, then sent back, and forced to undergo many interrogations and hardship before he, and his brother, and various companions were put to death. The remains of the church of [[Clement of Ancyra|St. Clement]] can be found today in a building just off Işıklar Caddesi in the Ulus district. Quite possibly this marks the site where Clement was originally buried. Four years later, a doctor of the town named Plato and his brother Antiochus also became celebrated martyrs under Galerius. [[Theodotus of Ancyra (martyr)|Theodotus of Ancyra]] is also venerated as a saint.

However, the persecution proved unsuccessful and in 314 Ancyra was the center of [[Synod of Ancyra|an important council]] of the [[Early Christianity|early church]]; which considered ecclesiastical policy for the reconstruction of the [[Christian Church]] after the persecutions, and in particular the treatment of 'lapsi'—Christians who had given in and conformed to [[paganism]] during these persecutions.

[[File:AnkaraColumnFar c.JPG|thumb|upright|The ''Column of Julian'' (362) was erected in honor of the Roman emperor [[Julian the Apostate]]'s visit to Ancyra.]]

Three councils were held in the former capital of Galatia in Asia Minor, during the 4th century. The first, an orthodox plenary synod, was held in 314, and its 25 disciplinary canons constitute one of the most important documents in the early history of the administration of the [[Confession (religion)|Sacrament of Penance]]. Nine of them deal with conditions for the reconciliation of the lapsi; the others, with marriage, alienations of church property, etc.

Though paganism was probably tottering in Ancyra in Clement's day, it may still have been the majority religion. Twenty years later, Christianity and [[monotheism]] had taken its place. Ancyra quickly turned into a Christian city, with a life dominated by monks and priests and theological disputes. The town council or senate gave way to the bishop as the main local figurehead. During the middle of the 4th century, Ancyra was involved in the complex theological disputes over the nature of Christ, and a form of [[Arianism]] seems to have originated there.

The synod of 358 was a [[Semi-Arianism|Semi-Arian]] [[conciliabulum]], presided over by [[Basil of Ancyra]]. It condemned the grosser Arian blasphemies, but set forth an equally heretical doctrine in the proposition that the Son was in all things similar to the Father, but not identical in substance.

In 362–363, the Emperor [[Julian the Apostate]] passed through Ancyra on his way to an ill-fated campaign against the Persians, and according to Christian sources, engaged in a persecution of various holy men. The stone base for a statue, with an inscription describing Julian as ''&quot;Lord of the whole world from the British Ocean to the barbarian nations&quot;'', can still be seen, built into the eastern side of the inner circuit of the walls of Ankara Castle. The Column of Julian which was erected in honor of the emperor's visit to the city in 362 still stands today. In 375, Arian bishops met at Ancyra and deposed several bishops, among them [[Gregory of Nyssa|St. Gregory of Nyssa]].

In the late 4th century, Ancyra became something of an imperial [[resort|holiday resort]]. After [[Constantinople]] became the [[Byzantine Empire|East Roman]] capital, emperors in the 4th and 5th centuries would retire from the humid summer weather on the [[Bosphorus|Bosporus]] to the drier mountain atmosphere of Ancyra. [[Theodosius II]] (408–450) kept his court in Ancyra in the summers. Laws issued in Ancyra testify to the time they spent there. The city's military as well as logistical significance lasted well into the long [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine rule]]. Although Ancyra temporarily fell into the hands of several Arab Muslim armies numerous times after the 7th century, it remained an important crossroads polis within the Byzantine Empire until the late 11th century. It was also the capital of the powerful [[Opsikion|Opsician Theme]], and after ca. 750 of the [[Bucellarian Theme]].

Ancyra, known in the West also as Angora, continued to be a residential [[episcopal see|see]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] until the 20th century, with about 40,000 faithful, mostly Turkish-speaking, but that situation ended as a result of the 1923 [[Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations]]. The earlier [[Armenian Genocide]] put an end to the residential eparchy of Ancyra of the [[Armenian Catholic Church]], which had been established in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k51627x/f401.image Bull ''Universi Dominici gregis''], in Giovanni Domenico Mansi, ''Sacrorum Conciliorum Nova et Amplissima Collectio'', vol.

===Turkish history===
[[File:Atatürk TBMM'den çıkarken.jpg|thumb|250px|President [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] (center) and Prime Minister [[İsmet İnönü]] (left) leaving the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey]] during the 7th anniversary celebrations of the Turkish Republic in 1930.]]
In 1071, the Turkish [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] Sultan [[Alp Arslan]] conquered much of [[Sultanate of Rum|eastern and central Anatolia]] after his victory at the [[Battle of Manzikert]]. He then annexed Ankara, an important location for military transportation and [[natural resource]]s, to his territory in 1073. After the [[Battle of Köse Dağ]] in 1243, in which the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] defeated the Seljuks, most of Anatolia became part of the dominion of the Mongols. Taking advantage of Seljuk decline, a semi-religious cast of craftsmen and trade people named ''[[Ahis|Ahiler]]'' chose Ankara as their independent city-state in 1290. [[Orhan I]], the second [[Bey]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], captured the city in 1356. [[Timur]] defeated the Ottomans at the [[Battle of Ankara]] in 1402 and took the city, but in 1403 Ankara was again under Ottoman control.

Following the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] defeat at [[World War I]], the Ottoman capital [[Constantinople]] (modern Istanbul) and much of [[Anatolia]] were occupied by the Allies, who planned to share these lands between [[First Republic of Armenia|Armenia]], [[French Third Republic|France]], [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], leaving for the Turks the core piece of land in central Anatolia. In response, the leader of the Turkish nationalist movement, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal Pasha]], established the headquarters of his [[Turkish National Movement|resistance movement]] in Ankara in 1920. After the [[Turkish War of Independence]] was won and the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] was superseded by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], the Turkish nationalists replaced the Ottoman Empire with the [[Republic of Turkey]] on 29 October 1923. A few days earlier, Ankara had officially replaced Constantinople as the new Turkish capital city, on 13 October 1923.

After Ankara became the capital of the newly founded Republic of Turkey, new development divided the city into an old section, called ''Ulus'', and a new section, called ''Yenişehir''. Ancient buildings reflecting Roman, Byzantine, and Ottoman history and narrow winding streets mark the old section. The new section, now centered on [[Kızılay Meydanı|Kızılay Square]], has the trappings of a more modern city: wide streets, hotels, theaters, shopping malls, and high-rises. Government offices and foreign embassies are also located in the new section. Ankara has experienced a phenomenal growth since it was made Turkey's capital. It was &quot;a small town of no importance&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Columbia Lippincott Gazeteer&lt;/ref&gt; when it was made the capital of Turkey. In 1924, the year after the government had moved there, Ankara had about 35,000 residents. By 1927 there were 44,553 residents and by 1950 the population had grown to 286,781.

==Climate==
Ankara has a hot-summer [[continental climate]] (''Dsa''). Due to its elevation and inland location, Ankara has cold, snowy winters and hot, dry summers. Rainfall occurs mostly during the spring and autumn. Under [[Köppen climate classification]], Ankara borders on a [[dry summer continental climate]] with a warm summer subtype (''Dsb''), and is near the borderline of a [[cold semi-arid climate]] (''BSk''), with some regions of the province having a true warm summer subtype (''Dsb'') of continental climate, depending on elevation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/mpeel/Koppen/World_Koppen_Map.png |title=World Map of the Köppen−Geiger climate classification |publisher=University of Melbourne |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of Ankara's high altitude and its dry summers, nightly temperatures in the summer months are cool. Ankara's annual average precipitation is fairly low at {{convert|sp=us|408|mm|0}}, nevertheless precipitation can be observed throughout the year. Monthly mean temperatures range from {{convert|0.3|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|23.5|°C|1}} in July, with an annual mean of {{convert|12.02|°C|1}}.

[[File:Ankara at night.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Ankara [[metropolitan area]]]]
[[File:Su perileri ankara.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Kızılay Square]] in Ankara, during the early years of the Turkish Republic, with the later demolished ''Su Perileri'' (Water Fairies) monumental fountain, c. 1930.&lt;ref name=Gezenadam&gt;[http://www.gezenadam.com/gezinotlari/dbtrips.php?ID=223 Gezenadam: &quot;Susuz Su Perileri&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SuPerileri&gt;[http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/ankara/16575415.asp Hürriyet: &quot;İnat değil kent kazandı&quot; (20-12-2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Ankara had a population of 75,000 in 1927. In 2013, Ankara has a population of 5,045,083 of which 2,507,525 are men and 2,537,558 are women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turkey pop 2007&quot;&gt;[http://www.tuik.gov.tr/jsp/duyuru/upload/adnks_Harita_TR/HaritaTR.html Türkiye istatistik kurumu] Address-based population survey 2007. Retrieved on 9 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Ankara became the capital of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, it was designated as a planned city for 500,000 future inhabitants. During the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, the city grew in a planned and orderly pace. However, from the 1950s onward, the city grew much faster than envisioned, because unemployment and poverty forced people to migrate from the countryside into the city in order to seek a better standard of living. As a result, many illegal houses called [[gecekondu]] were built around the city, causing the unplanned and uncontrolled urban landscape of Ankara, as not enough planned housing could be built fast enough. Although precariously built, the vast majority of them have electricity, running water and modern household amenities.

Nevertheless, many of these gecekondus have been replaced by huge public housing projects in the form of [[tower block]]s such as Elvankent, [[Eryaman, Etimesgut|Eryaman]] and [[Güzelkent, Etimesgut|Güzelkent]]; and also as mass housing compounds for military and civil service accommodation. Although many gecekondus still remain, they too are gradually being replaced by mass housing compounds, as empty land plots in the city of Ankara for new construction projects are becoming impossible to find.

Historically, the production of [[mohair]] from the [[Angora goat]], and [[Angora wool]] from the [[Angora rabbit]], have been an important part of the city's economy. These fabrics have been exported from Ankara to Europe and other parts of the globe for centuries.

The [[Central Anatolia Region]] is one of the primary locations of grape and [[Turkish wine|wine production in Turkey]], and Ankara is particularly famous for its [[Kalecik Karası]] and [[Muscat (grape and wine)|Muscat grapes]]; and its [[Kavaklıdere (winery)|Kavaklıdere wine]], which is produced in the [[Kavaklıdere, Ankara|Kavaklıdere]] neighbourhood within the [[Çankaya, Ankara|Çankaya]] district of the city. Ankara is also famous for its pears. Another renowned natural product of Ankara is its indigenous type of [[honey]] (''Ankara Balı'') which is known for its light color and is mostly produced by the [[Atatürk Forest Farm and Zoo]] in the Gazi district, and by other facilities in the Elmadağ, Çubuk and Beypazarı districts.

Ankara is the center of the state-owned and private Turkish [[Arms industry|defence]] and [[Aerospace manufacturer|aerospace]] companies, where the industrial plants and headquarters of the [[Turkish Aerospace Industries]], [[Mechanical and Chemical Industry Corporation (Turkey)|MKE]], [[ASELSAN]], [[Havelsan]], [[Roketsan]], [[FNSS Defence Systems|FNSS]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fnss.com.tr/ FNSS]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nurol Makina]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nurolmakina.com.tr/ Nurol]&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous other firms are located. Exports to foreign countries from these defence and aerospace firms have steadily increased in the past decades. The [[International Defence Industry Fair|IDEF]] in Ankara is one of the largest international expositions of the global [[arms industry]]. A number of the global [[automotive industry|automotive companies]] also have production facilities in Ankara, such as the German bus and truck manufacturer [[MAN SE]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.man.com.tr/ MAN Türkiye]&lt;/ref&gt; Ankara hosts the [[OSTIM Industrial Zone]], Turkey's largest [[industrial park]].

A large percentage of the complicated employment in Ankara is provided by the state institutions; such as the [[ministry (government department)|ministries]], undersecretariats, and other administrative bodies of the Turkish government. There are also many foreign citizens working as diplomats or clerks in the [[embassy|embassies]] of their respective countries.

Ankara is politically a triple battleground between the ruling conservative [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] (AKP), the opposition [[Kemalism|Kemalist]] centre-left [[Republican People's Party (Turkey)|Republican People's Party]] (CHP) and the nationalist far-right [[Nationalist Movement Party]] (MHP). The [[Ankara Province|province of Ankara]] is divided into 25 districts. The CHP's key and almost only political stronghold in Ankara lies within the central area of [[Çankaya]], which is the city's most populous district. While the CHP has always gained between 60 to 70% of the vote in Çankaya since 2002, political support elsewhere throughout Ankara is minimal. The high population within Çankaya, as well as [[Yenimahalle]] to an extent, has allowed the CHP to take overall second place behind the AKP in both local and general elections, with the MHP a close third, despite the fact that the MHP is politically stronger than the CHP in almost every other district. Overall, the AKP enjoys the most support throughout the city. The electorate of Ankara thus tend to vote in favour of the political right, far more so than the other main cities of [[Istanbul]] and [[İzmir]]. In retrospect, the [[2013–14 protests in Turkey|2013-14 protests against the AKP government]] were particularly strong in Ankara, proving to be fatal on multiple occasions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/05/ethem-sarisuluk-killed-turkey-protests_n_3390502.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Melih Gökçek]] has been the Metropolitan Mayor of Ankara since 1994 as a politician from the [[Welfare Party]]. He later joined the [[Virtue Party]] and then the AKP. Initially elected in the [[Turkish local elections, 1994|1994 local elections]], he was re-elected in [[Turkish local elections, 1999|1999]], [[Turkish local elections, 2004|2004]] and [[Turkish local elections, 2009|2009]]. In the [[Turkish local elections, 2014|2014 local election]], Gökçek stood for a fifth term. The MHP metropolitan mayoral candidate for the 2009 local elections, conservative politician [[Mansur Yavaş]], stood as the CHP candidate against Gökçek. In a heavily controversial election, Gökçek was declared the winner by just 1% ahead of Yavaş amid allegations of systematic electoral fraud. With the [[Supreme Electoral Council of Turkey|Supreme Electoral Council]] and courts rejecting Yavaş's appeals, he has declared intention to take the irregularities to the [[European Court of Human Rights]]. Although Gökçek was inaugurated for a fifth term, most election observers believe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Dikmen Vadisi, Ankara 3.jpg|thumb|Dikmen Valley Park]]

Ankara has many parks and open spaces mainly established in the early years of the Republic and well maintained and expanded thereafter. The most important of these parks are: [[Gençlik Parkı]] (houses an [[amusement park]] with a large pond for rowing), the [[Botanical garden]], Seğmenler Park, Anayasa Park, [[Kuğulu Park]] (famous for the swans received as a gift from the [[PRC|Chinese]] government), [[Abdi İpekçi]] Park, Güven Park (see above for the monument), Kurtuluş Park (has an ice-skating rink), [[Altınpark]] (also a prominent exposition/fair area), Harikalar Diyarı (claimed to be Biggest Park of Europe inside city borders) and Göksu Park.

[[Atatürk Forest Farm and Zoo]] (''Atatürk Orman Çiftliği'') is an expansive recreational farming area which houses a [[zoo]], several small agricultural farms, [[greenhouse]]s, restaurants, a [[dairy farming|dairy farm]] and a brewery. It is a pleasant place to spend a day with family, be it for having picnics, hiking, biking or simply enjoying good food and nature. There is also an exact replica of the house where Atatürk was born in 1881, in [[Thessaloniki]], Greece. Visitors to the &quot;Çiftlik&quot; (farm) as it is affectionately called by Ankarans, can sample such famous products of the farm such as old-fashioned beer and [[ice cream]], fresh [[dairy product]]s and meat rolls/kebaps made on charcoal, at a traditional restaurant (''Merkez Lokantası'', Central Restaurant), cafés and other establishments scattered around the farm.

===Shopping===
[[File:Ankara Atakule.JPG|thumb|left|[[Atakule Tower]] (1989)]]
[[File:A view of Sheraton Ankara from Karum Shopping Mall.JPG|thumb|[[Sheraton Ankara]] rising behind [[List of shopping malls in Turkey#Ankara|Karum shopping mall]] in the [[Kavaklıdere, Ankara|Kavaklıdere]] quarter of the [[Çankaya, Ankara|Çankaya]] business and leisure district.]]

Foreign visitors to Ankara usually like to visit the old shops in ''Çıkrıkçılar Yokuşu'' (Weavers' Road) near Ulus, where myriad things ranging from traditional fabrics, hand-woven carpets and leather products can be found at bargain prices. ''Bakırcılar Çarşısı'' (Bazaar of Coppersmiths) is particularly popular, and many interesting items, not just of copper, can be found here like jewelry, carpets, costumes, antiques and embroidery. Up the hill to the castle gate, there are many shops selling a huge and fresh collection of spices, [[dried fruit]]s, nuts, and other produce.

Modern shopping areas are mostly found in [[Kızılay, Ankara|Kızılay]], or on Tunalı Hilmi Avenue, including the modern mall of [[List of shopping malls in Turkey#Ankara|Karum]] (named after the ancient [[Assyria]]n merchant colonies called [[Kültepe#Kârum Kaneš|''Kârum'']] that were established in [[Central Anatolia Region|central]] [[Anatolia]] at the beginning of the [[2nd millennium BC]]) which is located towards the end of the Avenue; and in [[Çankaya, Ankara|Çankaya]], the quarter with the highest elevation in the city. [[Atakule|Atakule Tower]] next to [[Atakule#Atrium shopping mall|Atrium Mall]] in Çankaya commands a magnificent view over Ankara and also has a [[revolving restaurant]] at the top, where the city's panorama can be enjoyed in a leisurely fashion. The symbol of the [[List of shopping malls in Turkey#Ankara|Armada Shopping Mall]] is an [[anchor]], and there's a large anchor monument at its entrance, as a reference to the ancient Greek name of the city, Ἄγκυρα (Ánkyra), which means anchor. Likewise, the anchor monument is also related with the Spanish name of the mall, Armada, which means [[naval fleet]].

As Ankara started expanding westward in the 1970s, several modern, suburbia-style developments and mini-cities began to rise along the western highway, also known as the [[Eskişehir]] Road. The ''Armada'' and ''CEPA'' malls on the highway, the ''Galleria'' in Ümitköy, and a huge mall, ''Real'' in Bilkent Center, offer North American and European style shopping opportunities (these places can be reached through the Eskişehir Highway.) There is also the newly expanded ''[[ANKAmall]]'' at the outskirts, on the Istanbul Highway, which houses most of the well-known international brands. This mall is the largest throughout the Ankara region.

===Archeological sites===

====Ankara Citadel====

[[File:MonumentumAncyranum28Nov2004.jpg|thumb|In the ''Temple of Augustus and Rome'' (commonly known as the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]]) in Ulus, the primary intact copy of [[Res Gestae Divi Augusti|Res Gestae]] written by the first Roman emperor [[Augustus]] survives.]]

The foundations of the [[Ankara Castle|Ankara castle and citadel]] were laid by the Galatians on a prominent [[lava]] outcrop ({{Coord|39.941|N|32.864|E|type:landmark|display=inline}}), and the rest was completed by the Romans. The Byzantines and Seljuks further made restorations and additions. The area around and inside the citadel, being the oldest part of Ankara, contains many fine examples of traditional architecture. There are also recreational areas to relax. Many restored traditional Turkish houses inside the citadel area have found new life as restaurants, serving local cuisine.

The citadel was depicted in various Turkish banknotes during 1927–1952 and 1983–1989.&lt;ref&gt;The citadel was depicted in the following Turkish banknotes:
* On the [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] of the 1 [[Turkish lira|lira]] banknote of 1927–1939 (1. Emission Group – One Turkish Lira – [http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/banknote/E1/6.htm I. Series]).
* On the obverse of the 5 lira banknote of 1927–1937 (1. Emission Group – Five Turkish Lira – [http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/banknote/E1/10.htm I. Series]).
* On the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the 10 lira banknote of 1927–1938 (1. Emission Group – Ten Turkish Lira – [http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/banknote/E1/14.htm I. Series]).

====Roman Theatre====
The remains, the stage, and the backstage of the Roman theatre can be seen outside [[Ankara Castle|the castle]]. Roman statues that were found here are exhibited in the [[Museum of Anatolian Civilizations]]. The seating area is still under excavation.

====Temple of Augustus and Rome====

The temple, also known as the [[Monumentum Ancyranum]], was built between 25&amp;nbsp;BC – 20&amp;nbsp;BC following the conquest of Central Anatolia by the [[Roman Empire]] and the formation of the Roman province of [[Galatia]], with Ancyra (modern Ankara) as its administrative capital. After the death of Augustus in 14 AD, a copy of the text of [[Res Gestae Divi Augusti]] was inscribed on the interior of the ''pronaos'' in Latin, whereas a Greek translation is also present on an exterior wall of the ''cella''. The temple, on the ancient Acropolis of Ancyra, was enlarged by the Romans in the 2nd century. In the 5th century it was converted into a church by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]]. It is located in the Ulus quarter of the city.

====Roman Baths====
The [[Roman Baths of Ankara]] have all the typical features of a classical [[Thermae|Roman bath complex]]: a ''[[frigidarium]]'' (cold room), a ''[[tepidarium]]'' (warm room) and a ''[[caldarium]]'' (hot room). The baths were built during the reign of the Roman emperor [[Caracalla]] in the early 3rd century AD to honor [[Asclepius|Asclepios]], the God of Medicine. Today, only the basement and first floors remain. It is situated in the Ulus quarter.

==Fauna==

===Angora cat===
{{Main|Turkish Angora}}
[[File:Odd-eyed Turkish Angora cat - 20080830.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Angora cat]]]]

Ankara is home to a world famous domestic [[cat breed]] – the [[Turkish Angora]], called ''Ankara kedisi'' (Ankara cat) in Turkish. Turkish Angoras are one of the ancient, naturally occurring cat breeds, having originated in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia.

They mostly have a white, silky, medium to long length coat, no undercoat and a fine bone structure. There seems to be a connection between the Angora Cats and [[Persian (cat)|Persians]], and the Turkish Angora is also a distant cousin of the [[Turkish Van]]. Although they are known for their shimmery white coat, currently there are more than twenty varieties including black, blue and reddish fur. They come in [[tabby cat|tabby]] and tabby-white, along with smoke varieties, and are in every color other than pointed, lavender, and cinnamon (all of which would indicate breeding to an outcross.)

Eyes may be blue, green, or amber, or even one blue and one amber or green. The W gene which is responsible for the white coat and blue eye is closely related to the hearing ability, and the presence of a blue eye can indicate that the cat is deaf to the side the blue eye is located. However, a great many blue and [[odd-eyed cat|odd-eyed]] white cats have normal hearing, and even deaf cats lead a very normal life if kept indoors.

Ears are pointed and large, eyes are almond shaped and the head is massive with a two plane profile. Another characteristic is the tail, which is often kept parallel to the back.

===Angora rabbit===
{{Main|Angora rabbit}}

[[File:Joey Giant Angora Buck.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Angora rabbit]]]]

The [[Angora rabbit]] ({{Lang-tr|Ankara tavşanı}}) is a variety of domestic rabbit bred for its long, soft hair. The Angora is one of the oldest types of domestic rabbit, originating in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia, along with the [[Turkish Angora|Angora cat]] and [[Angora goat]]. The rabbits were popular pets with French royalty in the mid-18th century, and spread to other parts of Europe by the end of the century. They first appeared in the United States in the early 20th century. They are bred largely for their long [[Angora wool]], which may be removed by [[sheep shearing|shear]]ing, combing, or [[plucking (hair removal)|pluck]]ing (gently pulling loose wool.)

Angoras are bred mainly for their wool because it is silky and soft. They have a humorous appearance, as they oddly resemble a fur ball. Most are calm and docile but should be handled carefully. Grooming is necessary to prevent the fiber from matting and felting on the rabbit. A condition called &quot;wool block&quot; is common in Angora rabbits and should be treated quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joyofhandspinning.com/angora-care.shtml |title=Angora Rabbit Breeds – How to Care for Your Angora Rabbit|accessdate=29 January 2009 |work=|publisher=|date=| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20090125215910/http://joyofhandspinning.com/angora-care.shtml| archivedate= 25 January 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes they are shorn in the summer as the long fur can cause the rabbits to overheat.

===Angora goat===
{{Main|Angora goat}}
[[File:Quebec angora goat.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Angora goat]]]]

The [[Angora goat]] ({{Lang-tr|Ankara keçisi}}) is a breed of [[goat|domestic goat]] that originated in Ankara and its surrounding region in central Anatolia.

This breed was first mentioned in the time of [[Moses]], roughly in 1500&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daisyshillfarm.com/My_Homepage_Files/Page2.html |title=Angora Goats history |publisher=Daisyshillfarm.com |date=|accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Angora goats were brought to Europe by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], about 1554, but, like later imports, were not very successful. Angora goats were first introduced in the United States in 1849 by Dr. James P. Davis. Seven adult goats were a gift from Sultan [[Abdülmecid I]] in appreciation for his services and advice on the raising of cotton.

The [[Pile (textile)|fleece]] taken from an Angora goat is called [[mohair]]. A single goat produces between five and eight kilograms of hair per year. Angoras are shorn twice a year, unlike [[Domestic sheep|sheep]], which are shorn only once. Angoras have high nutritional requirements due to their rapid hair growth. A poor quality diet will curtail mohair development. The United States, [[Turkey]], and South Africa are the top producers of mohair.

For a long period of time, Angora goats were bred for their white coat. In 1998, the Colored Angora Goat Breeders Association was set up to promote breeding of colored Angoras. Today, Angora goats produce white, black (deep black to greys and silver), red (the color fades significantly as the goat gets older), and brownish fiber.

Angora goats were depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Turkish 50 [[Turkish lira|lira]] banknotes of 1938–1952.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcmb.gov.tr/yeni/eng/ Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey].
