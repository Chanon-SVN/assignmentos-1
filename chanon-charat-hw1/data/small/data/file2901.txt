Bayesian probability
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Bayesian statistics}}
'''Bayesian probability''' is one [[Probability interpretations|interpretation]] of the concept of [[probability]]. The Bayesian interpretation of probability can be seen as an extension of [[propositional logic]] that enables [[reason|reasoning]] with hypotheses, i.e., the [[propositions]] whose [[truth value|truth or falsity]] is [[uncertainty|uncertain]].

Bayesian probability belongs to the category of evidential probabilities; to evaluate the probability of a hypothesis, the Bayesian probabilist specifies some prior probability, which is then updated in the light of new, relevant [[data]] (evidence).&lt;ref name=&quot;paulos&quot;&gt;Paulos, John Allen. [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/07/books/review/the-theory-that-would-not-die-by-sharon-bertsch-mcgrayne-book-review.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=thomas%20bayes&amp;st=cse ''The Mathematics of Changing Your Mind,''] New York Times (US). August 5, 2011; retrieved 2011-08-06&lt;/ref&gt; The Bayesian interpretation provides a standard set of procedures and formulae to perform this calculation.

In contrast to interpreting [[probability]] as the [[Frequentist probability|&quot;frequency&quot;]] or [[propensity probability|&quot;propensity&quot;]] of some phenomenon, Bayesian probability is a quantity that we assign for the purpose of representing a state of knowledge,&lt;ref name = &quot;ghxaib&quot;&gt;Jaynes, E.T. &quot;Bayesian Methods: General Background.&quot; In Maximum-Entropy and Bayesian Methods in Applied Statistics, by J. H. Justice (ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; or a state of belief.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finetti, B. 1974&quot; /&gt; In the Bayesian view, a probability is assigned to a hypothesis, whereas under the [[Frequentist inference|frequentist view]], a hypothesis is typically [[hypothesis test|tested]] without being assigned a probability.

The term &quot;Bayesian&quot; refers to the 18th century mathematician and theologian [[Thomas Bayes]], who provided the first mathematical treatment of a non-trivial problem of [[Bayesian inference]].&lt;ref&gt;Stigler, Stephen M. (1986) ''The history of statistics.'' Harvard University press. pg 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Mathematician [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] pioneered and popularised what is now called Bayesian probability.&lt;ref&gt;Stigler, Stephen M. (1986) ''The history of statistics.'', Harvard University press. pp97-98, 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly speaking, there are two views on Bayesian probability that interpret the ''probability'' concept in different ways. According to the ''objectivist view'', the rules of Bayesian statistics can be justified by [[Cox's theorem|requirements of rationality and consistency]] and interpreted as an extension of [[logic]].&lt;ref name = &quot;ghxaib&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;vkdmsn&quot;&gt;Cox, Richard T.

==Bayesian methodology==

Bayesian methods are characterized by the following concepts and procedures:

* The use of random variables, or, more generally, unknown quantities,&lt;ref name=&quot;rbp&quot; /&gt; to model all sources of uncertainty in statistical models. This also includes uncertainty resulting from lack of information (see also the [[Uncertainty_quantification#Aleatoric_and_epistemic_uncertainty|aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty]]).
* The need to determine the ''prior probability distribution'' taking into account the available (prior) information.
* The ''sequential use of the [[Bayes' formula]]'': when more data becomes available, calculate the ''posterior distribution'' using the Bayes' formula; subsequently, the posterior distribution becomes the next prior.
* For the frequentist a [[null hypothesis|hypothesis]] is a [[Proposition#Treatment_in_logic|proposition]] (which must be [[principle of bivalence|either true or false]]), so that the frequentist probability of a hypothesis is either one or zero. In Bayesian statistics, a probability can be assigned to a hypothesis that can differ from 0 or 1 if the truth value is uncertain.

==Objective and subjective Bayesian probabilities==

Broadly speaking, there are two views on Bayesian probability that interpret the 'probability' concept in different ways. For '''[[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivists]]''', ''probability'' objectively measures the plausibility of propositions, i.e. the probability of a proposition corresponds to a reasonable belief everyone (even a &quot;robot&quot;) sharing the same knowledge should share in accordance with the rules of Bayesian statistics, which can be justified by [[Cox's theorem|requirements of rationality and consistency]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ghxaib&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vkdmsn&quot; /&gt; For '''[[Subjectivism|subjectivists]]''', probability corresponds to a 'personal belief'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finetti, B. 1974&quot; /&gt; For subjectivists, rationality and coherence constrain the probabilities a subject may have, but allow for substantial variation within those constraints. The objective and subjective variants of Bayesian probability differ mainly in their interpretation and construction of the prior probability.

==History==
{{Main|History of statistics#Bayesian statistics}}

The term ''Bayesian'' refers to [[Thomas Bayes]] (1702&amp;ndash;1761), who proved a special case of what is now called [[Bayes' theorem]] in a paper titled &quot;[[An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;McGrayne, Sharon Bertsch. (2011). {{Google books|_Kx5xVGuLRIC|''The Theory That Would Not Die,'' p. 10.|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that special case, the prior and posterior distributions were [[Beta distribution]]s and the data came from [[Bernoulli trial]]s. It was [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] (1749&amp;ndash;1827) who introduced a general version of the theorem and used it to approach problems in [[celestial mechanics]], medical statistics, [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]], and [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;Stigler, Stephen M. (1986) ''The history of statistics.'' Harvard University press. Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Early Bayesian inference, which used uniform priors following Laplace's [[principle of insufficient reason]], was called &quot;[[inverse probability]]&quot; (because it [[Inductive reasoning|infer]]s backwards from observations to parameters, or from effects to causes).&lt;ref name=Fienberg2006&gt;Fienberg, Stephen. E. (2006) [http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/journal/2006/vol01/issue01/fienberg.pdf ''When did Bayesian Inference become &quot;Bayesian&quot;?''] ''Bayesian Analysis'', 1 (1), 1&amp;ndash;40. See page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1920s, &quot;inverse probability&quot; was largely supplanted  by a collection of methods that came to be called [[frequentist statistics]].&lt;ref name=Fienberg2006/&gt;

In the 20th century, the ideas of Laplace were further developed in two different directions, giving rise to ''objective'' and ''subjective'' currents in Bayesian practice. In the objectivist stream, the statistical analysis depends on only the model assumed and the data analysed.&lt;ref name=Bernardo&gt;[[José-Miguel Bernardo|Bernardo, J.M.]] (2005), ''Reference analysis'', ''Handbook of statistics'', 25, 17&amp;ndash;90&lt;/ref&gt; No subjective decisions need to be involved. In contrast, &quot;subjectivist&quot; statisticians deny the possibility of fully objective analysis for the general case.

In the 1980s, there was a dramatic growth in research and applications of Bayesian methods, mostly attributed to the discovery of [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] methods, which removed many of the computational problems, and an increasing interest in nonstandard, complex applications.&lt;ref&gt;Wolpert, R.L. (2004) ''A conversation with James O. Berger'', Statistical science, 9, 205&amp;ndash;218&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the growth of Bayesian research, most undergraduate teaching is still based on frequentist statistics.&lt;ref&gt;[[José-Miguel Bernardo|Bernardo, José M.]] (2006) [http://www.ime.usp.br/~abe/ICOTS7/Proceedings/PDFs/InvitedPapers/3I2_BERN.pdf ''A Bayesian mathematical statistics primer'']. ICOTS-7&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Nonetheless, Bayesian methods are widely accepted and used, such as in the field of [[machine learning]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Bishop, C.M. ''Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning.'' Springer, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justification of Bayesian probabilities==

The use of Bayesian probabilities as the basis of [[Bayesian inference]] has been supported by several arguments, such as the [[Cox's theorem|Cox axioms]], the [[Dutch book|Dutch book argument]], arguments based on [[decision theory]] and [[de Finetti's theorem]].

===Axiomatic approach===
[[Richard Threlkeld Cox|Richard T. Cox]] showed that&lt;ref name = &quot;vkdmsn&quot; /&gt; Bayesian updating follows from several axioms, including two [[functional equations]] and a controversial hypothesis of differentiability. It is known that Cox's 1961 development (mainly copied by [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes|Jaynes]]) is non-rigorous, and in fact a counterexample has been found by Halpern.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, J. ''A counterexample to theorems of Cox and Fine'', Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 10: 67-85.&lt;/ref&gt; The assumption of differentiability or even continuity is questionable since the Boolean algebra of statements may only be finite.&lt;ref name=&quot;rbp&quot;&gt;Dupré, Maurice J., Tipler, Frank T. [http://ba.stat.cmu.edu/journal/2009/vol04/issue03/dupre.pdf ''New Axioms For Bayesian Probability''], Bayesian Analysis (2009), Number 3, pp. 599-606&lt;/ref&gt; Other axiomatizations have been suggested by various authors to make the theory more rigorous.&lt;ref name=&quot;rbp&quot; /&gt;

===Dutch book approach===
The Dutch book argument was proposed by de Finetti, and is based on betting. A [[Dutch book]] is made when a clever gambler places a set of bets that guarantee a profit, no matter what the outcome of the bets. If a [[bookmaker]] follows the rules of the Bayesian calculus in the construction of his odds, a Dutch book cannot be made.

However, [[Ian Hacking]] noted that traditional Dutch book arguments did not specify Bayesian updating: they left open the possibility that non-Bayesian updating rules could avoid Dutch books. For example, [[Ian Hacking|Hacking]] writes&lt;ref&gt;Hacking (1967, Section 3, page 316), Hacking (1988, page 124)&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;And neither the Dutch book argument, nor any other in the personalist arsenal of proofs of the probability axioms, entails the dynamic assumption. Not one entails Bayesianism. So the personalist requires the dynamic assumption to be Bayesian. It is true that in consistency a personalist could abandon the Bayesian model of learning from experience. Salt could lose its savour.&quot;

In fact, there are non-Bayesian updating rules that also avoid Dutch books (as discussed in the literature on &quot;probability kinematics&quot; following the publication of [[Richard Jeffrey|Richard C. Jeffreys]]' rule, which is itself regarded as Bayesian &lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bayes-theorem/&lt;/ref&gt;). The additional hypotheses sufficient to (uniquely) specify Bayesian updating are substantial, complicated, and unsatisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bas van Fraassen|van Frassen, B.]] (1989) ''Laws and Symmetry'', Oxford University Press. ISBN 0-19-824860-1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decision theory approach===
A [[statistical decision theory|decision-theoretic]] justification of the use of Bayesian inference (and hence of Bayesian probabilities) was given by [[Abraham Wald]], who proved that every [[admissible decision rule|admissible]] statistical procedure is either a Bayesian procedure or a limit of Bayesian procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Wald, Abraham. ''Statistical Decision Functions.'' Wiley 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, every Bayesian procedure is [[admissible decision rule|admissible]].&lt;ref&gt;Bernardo, José M., Smith, Adrian F.M. ''Bayesian Theory.'' John Wiley 1994. ISBN 0-471-92416-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal probabilities and objective methods for constructing priors==
Following the work on [[expected utility]] [[optimal decision|theory]] of [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] and [[John von Neumann|von Neumann]],  decision-theorists have accounted for [[optimal decision|rational behavior]] using a probability distribution for the [[Agent-based model|agent]]. Johann Pfanzagl completed the ''[[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]'' by providing an axiomatization of subjective probability and utility, a task left uncompleted by von Neumann and [[Oskar Morgenstern]]: their original theory supposed that all the agents had the same probability distribution, as a convenience.&lt;ref&gt;Pfanzagl (1967, 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; Pfanzagl's axiomatization was endorsed by [[Oskar Morgenstern]]: &quot;Von Neumann and I have anticipated&quot; the question whether probabilities &quot;might, perhaps more typically, be subjective and have stated specifically that in the latter case axioms could be found from which could derive the desired numerical utility together with a number for the probabilities (cf. p. 19 of The [[Theory of Games and Economic Behavior]]). We did not carry this out; it was demonstrated by Pfanzagl ... with all the necessary rigor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Morgenstern (1976, page 65)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramsey and [[Leonard Jimmie Savage|Savage]] noted that the individual agent's probability distribution could be objectively studied in experiments. The role of judgment and disagreement in science has been recognized since [[Aristotle]] and even more clearly with [[Francis Bacon]]. The objectivity of science lies not in the psychology of individual scientists, but in the process of science and especially in statistical methods, as noted by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stigler |first=Stephen M. |year=1978 |authorlink=Stephen Stigler |title=Mathematical statistics in the early States |journal=Annals of Statistics |volume=6 |issue=March |pages=239–265 esp. p. 248 |publisher= |doi=10.1214/aos/1176344123 |jstor=2958876 |mr=483118 |url=http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1176344123 |accessdate= |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recall that the objective methods for falsifying propositions about personal probabilities have been used for a half century, as noted previously. Procedures for [[statistical hypothesis testing|testing hypotheses]] about probabilities (using finite samples) are due to [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] (1931) and [[Bruno de Finetti|de Finetti]] (1931, 1937, 1964, 1970). Both [[Bruno de Finetti]] and [[Frank P. Ramsey]] acknowledge{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} their debts to [[pragmatic philosophy]], particularly (for Ramsey) to [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles S. Peirce]].

The &quot;Ramsey test&quot; for evaluating probability distributions is implementable in theory, and has kept experimental psychologists occupied for a half century.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson et al. (1957)&lt;/ref&gt;
This work demonstrates that Bayesian-probability propositions can be [[Falsifiability|falsified]], and so meet an empirical criterion of [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles S. Peirce]], whose work inspired Ramsey. (This [[falsifiability]]-criterion was popularized by [[Karl Popper]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/popper/#ProDem &quot;Karl Popper&quot; in ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Popper, Karl. (2002) [http://books.google.com/books?id=T76Zd20IYlgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=logic+of+scientific+discovery&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eGfU8COmAA&amp;sig=W8TTt29x5sG8aCGpYuWnonDFH8M&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=crC3TJKND46ssAPp06jkCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=falsifiability&amp;f=false ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery''] 2nd Edition, Routledge ISBN 0-415-27843-0 (Reprint of 1959 translation of 1935 original) Page 57.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Modern work on the experimental evaluation of personal probabilities uses the randomization, [[double blind|blinding]], and Boolean-decision procedures of the Peirce-Jastrow experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce &amp; Jastrow (1885)
&lt;/ref&gt; Since individuals act according to different probability judgments, these agents' probabilities are &quot;personal&quot; (but amenable to objective study).

Personal probabilities are problematic for science and for some applications where decision-makers lack the knowledge or time to specify an informed probability-distribution (on which they are prepared to act). To meet the needs of science and of human limitations, Bayesian statisticians have developed &quot;objective&quot; methods for specifying prior probabilities.

Indeed, some Bayesians have argued the prior state of knowledge defines ''the'' (unique) prior probability-distribution for &quot;regular&quot; statistical problems; cf. [[well-posed problem]]s. Finding the right method for constructing such &quot;objective&quot; priors (for appropriate classes of regular problems) has been the quest of statistical theorists from Laplace to [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[Harold Jeffreys]], and [[Edwin Thompson Jaynes]]: These theorists and their successors have suggested several methods for constructing &quot;objective&quot; priors:
* [[principle of maximum entropy|Maximum entropy]]
* [[Haar measure|Transformation group analysis]]
* [[José-Miguel Bernardo|Reference analysis]]
Each of these methods contributes useful priors for &quot;regular&quot; one-parameter problems, and each prior can handle some challenging [[statistical model]]s (with &quot;irregularity&quot; or several parameters). Each of these methods has been useful in Bayesian practice. Indeed, methods for constructing &quot;objective&quot; (alternatively, &quot;default&quot; or &quot;ignorance&quot;) priors have been developed by avowed subjective (or &quot;personal&quot;) Bayesians like [[James Berger (statistician)|James Berger]] ([[Duke University]]) and [[José-Miguel Bernardo]] ([[University of Valencia|Universitat de València]]), simply because such priors are needed for Bayesian practice, particularly in science.&lt;ref name=&quot;refa&quot;&gt;Bernardo, J. M. (2005). [http://www.uv.es/~bernardo/RefAna.pdf ''Reference Analysis'']. ''Handbook of Statistics'' 25 (D. K. Dey and C. R. Rao eds). Amsterdam: Elsevier, 17-90&lt;/ref&gt; The quest for &quot;the universal method for constructing priors&quot; continues to attract statistical theorists.&lt;ref name=&quot;refa&quot; /&gt;

Thus, the Bayesian statistician needs either to use informed priors (using relevant expertise or previous data) or to choose among the competing methods for constructing &quot;objective&quot; priors.
