The term '''black people''' is an English-language phrase, used in certain countries, often in socially-based systems of [[racial classification]] or of ethnicity to describe persons who are defined as belonging to a &quot;black&quot; ethnicity in their particular country, typically having either a degree of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]n ancestry, or who are perceived to be [[Dark skin|dark-skinned]] compared to other racial groups.

Different societies, such as [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]] and [[South Africa]] apply differing criteria regarding who is classified as &quot;black&quot;, and these criteria have also varied over time. In some countries, social variables affect classification as much as skin color, and the social criteria for &quot;blackness&quot; vary. For example, in North America the term ''black people'' is not necessarily an indicator of skin color or ethnic origin but is more of a socially-based racial classification related to being [[African American]], with a family history related to [[Slavery in the United States|institutionalized slavery]]. In South Africa and Latin America, mixed-race people are not considered to be &quot;black&quot;, and in other regions, such as Australia and [[Melanesia]], the term &quot;black&quot; has been applied to, and used by, populations with a different history and racial origin.

In [[South Africa]] during the [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid era]], beginning in the first half of the twentieth century, the population was classified into four main racial groups: ''Black'', ''White'', ''[[Asia]]n'' (mostly [[India]]n), and ''[[Coloured]]''.&lt;!--These terms are capitalized to denote their legal definitions in South African law.--&gt; The Coloured group included people of mixed [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]], [[Khoisan]], and [[European ethnic groups|European]] descent (with some [[Cape Malays|Malay]] ancestry, especially in the [[Western Cape]]). The Coloured definition occupied an intermediary political position between the Black and White definitions in South Africa.

The [[apartheid]] bureaucracy devised complex (and often arbitrary) criteria in the [[Population Registration Act]] of 1945 to determine who belonged in which group. Minor officials administered tests to enforce the classifications. When it was unclear from a person's physical appearance whether a person was to be considered Coloured or Black, the &quot;[[Pencil test (South Africa)|pencil test]]&quot; was employed. This involved inserting a pencil in a person's hair to determine if the hair was kinky enough for the pencil to get stuck. If so, the person was classified as Black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Nullis| first = Clare | title = Township tourism booming in South Africa| publisher = The Associated Press| year= 2007| url = http://www.canada.com/topics/travel/features/story.html?id=59ec6285-c9fb-41ab-93f9-419f62733f07&amp;k=67896}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sandra Laing]] is a South African woman who was classified as Coloured by authorities during the apartheid era, due to her [[Human skin colour|skin colour]] and [[hair#hair texture|hair texture]], although she was the child of at least three generations of European ancestors. At age 10, she was expelled from her all-white school, and the authorities' decisions based on her anomalous appearance disrupted her family and adult life. She was the subject of the 2008 biographical dramatic film ''[[Skin (2008 film)|Skin]]'', which won numerous awards.

During the apartheid era, those classed as &quot;Coloured&quot; were oppressed and discriminated against. But, they had limited rights and overall had slightly better socioeconomic conditions than those classed as &quot;Black&quot;.

In the post-apartheid era, the Constitution of South Africa has declared the country to be a 'Non-racial democracy&quot;. However, the ANC government has introduced laws in support of their [[affirmative action]] policies that define &quot;Black&quot; people to include &quot;Africans&quot;, &quot;Coloureds&quot; and &quot;Asians&quot;. Their [[affirmative action]] policies have also favored &quot;Africans&quot; over &quot;Coloureds&quot;. Some South Africans categorized as &quot;African Black&quot; openly state that &quot;Coloureds&quot; did not suffer as much as they did during apartheid. The popular saying by &quot;Coloured&quot; South Africans to illustrate their dilemma is:

{{quote|We were not white enough under apartheid, and we are not black enough under the ANC ([[African National Congress]])}}

In 2008, the High Court in South Africa ruled that [[Chinese South Africans]] who were residents during the apartheid era (and their descendents) are to be reclassified as &quot;Black people&quot; solely for the purposes of accessing affirmative action benefits, because they were also &quot;disadvantaged&quot; by racial discrimination. Chinese people who arrived in the country after the end of apartheid do not qualify.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/africa/article4168245.ece &quot;We agree that you are black, South African court tells Chinese&quot;], ''The Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

Other than by appearance, &quot;Coloureds&quot; can usually be distinguished from &quot;Blacks&quot; by language. Most speak [[Afrikaans]] or English as a [[first language]], as opposed to [[Bantu languages]] such as [[Zulu language|Zulu]] or [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]]. They also tend to have more European-sounding names than [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = du Preez| first = Max| title = Coloureds&amp;nbsp;– the most authentic SA citizens| work= The Star|date=13 April 2006| url = http://www.thestar.co.za/index.php?fArticleId=3201857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of black communities in [[North Africa]], some dating from prehistoric communities, others as descendants from the historical [[Trans-Saharan trade]] and after the Arab invasions of North Africa in the 7th century, descendants of slaves from the [[Arab Slave Trade]] in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Frigi et al. 2010, [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/human_biology/summary/v082/82.4.frigi.html Ancient Local Evolution of African mtDNA Haplogroups in Tunisian Berber Populations], Human Biology, Volume 82, Number 4, August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;biomedcentral.com&quot;&gt;Harich et .al 2010, [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/138 The trans-Saharan slave trade – clues from interpolation analyses and high-resolution characterization of mitochondrial DNA lineages]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, the Moroccan Sultan [[Moulay Ismail]] &quot;the Bloodthirsty&quot; (1672–1727) raised a corps of 150,000 black slaves, called his [[Black Guard]], who coerced the country into submission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html Lewis.

According to Dr.&amp;nbsp;[[Carlos Moore (writer)|Carlos Moore]], resident scholar at Brazil's University of the State of Bahia, Afro-multiracials in the Arab world, including Arabs in North Africa, self-identify in ways that resemble [[Latin America]]. He claims that black-looking Arabs, much like black-looking [[Latin Americans]], consider themselves white because they have some distant white ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Musselman| first = Anson | title = The Subtle Racism of Latin America| publisher = UCLA International Institute| url=http://www.international.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=4125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sadat's mother was a dark-skinned Nubian [[Sudan]]ese woman and his father was a light-skinned [[Egyptians|Egyptian]]. In response to an advertisement for an acting position, he said, &quot;I am not white but I am not exactly black either.

[[Fathia Nkrumah]] was another Egyptian with ties to [[West Africa]]. She was the late wife of [[Ghana]]ian revolutionary [[Kwame Nkrumah]], whose marriage was seen as helping plant the seeds of cooperation between Egypt and other African countries as they struggled for independence from European colonization. This helped advance the formation of the [[African Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ausummit-accra.org.gh/index1.php?linkid=289&amp;adate=04%2F07%2F2007&amp;archiveid=140&amp;page=1 African Union Summit]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the patriarchal nature of Arab society, Arab men, including during the slave trade in North Africa, enslaved more black women than men, and used more black female slaves than males. The men interpreted the [[Qur'an]] to permit sexual relations between a male master and his female slave outside of marriage (see [[Ma malakat aymanukum and sex]]),&lt;ref&gt;See [[Tahfeem ul Qur'an]] by [[Maududi|Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]], Vol. 2, pp. 112–113, footnote 44.

When an enslaved woman became pregnant with her Arab master's child, she became ''umm walad'' or “mother of a child”, a status that granted her privileged rights. As the child was given rights of inheritance, mixed-race children could share in any wealth of the father.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arab Slave Trade&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabslavetrade.com|publisher=&quot;[[Owen 'Alik Shahadah]]&quot;|title=Slavery in Arabia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the society was [[patrilineal]], the children took their fathers' social status at birth and were born free. Some succeeded their fathers as rulers, as was the case with Sultan [[Ahmad al-Mansur]], who ruled [[Morocco]] from 1578 to 1608, though technically not mixed-race. His mother was a [[Fulani]] [[concubine]] of his father. Such tolerance for black persons, even when technically &quot;free&quot;, was not so common in Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Hunwick| first = John| title = Arab Views of Black Africans and Slavery| url=http://www.yale.edu/glc/events/race/Hunwick.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''abd'' ({{lang-ar|عبد}},) (meaning &quot;slave&quot;), is still used as a common term for black people in the Arabic-speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first = Theola | last = Labbé |author2=Omar Fekeiki | title = A Legacy Hidden in Plain Sight | work = Washington Post | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A6645-2004Jan10 | date = 11 January 2004 | accessdate =29 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Indigenous Australians]] have been referred to as &quot;black people&quot; in Australia since the [[History of Australia (1788–1850)|early days of European settlement]].&lt;ref&gt;http://trove.nla.gov.au/ndp/del/article/4219798&lt;/ref&gt; While originally related to [[skin colour]], the term is used to today to indicate Aboriginal or [[Torres Strait Islander]] [[ancestry]] in general and can refer to people of any skin pigmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/politics/aboriginal-identity-goes-beyond-skin-colour-20110406-1d40r.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Aboriginal identity goes beyond skin colour}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Being identified as either &quot;black&quot; or &quot;white&quot; in [[Australia]] during the 19th and early 20th centuries was critical in one's employment and social prospects. Various state-based [[Aboriginal Protection Board]]s were established which had virtually complete control over the lives of Indigenous Australians – where they lived, their employment, marriage, education and included the power to separate children from their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Broome | first = Richard | title = Aboriginal Victorians: A History Since 1800 | publisher = [[Allen &amp; Unwin]] | year = 2005 | pages = 130–131 | isbn = 978-1-74114-569-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://aeon.sro.wa.gov.au/Investigator/Details/Agency_Detail.asp?Id=1200 Aboriginal Protection Board at the ''State Records Office of Western Australia'', accessed 20 December 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item-sdid-54.html |title=Aboriginal Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act 1897 (Qld) |publisher=Museum of Australian Democracy |accessdate=2012-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aborigines were not allowed to vote and were often confined to reserves and forced into low paid or effectively slave labour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/whole34.pdf |pages=1–24 |first=Heather |last=Goodall |title=Land In Our Own Country: The Aboriginal Land Rights Movement in South Eastern Australia, 1860 to 1914 |journal=Aboriginal History |volume=14 |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/42696/2/Aborigines.pdf |first=Mick |last=Armstrong |title=Aborigines: Problems of Race and Class | year=2004 |accessdate=1/12/2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social position of mixed-race or &quot;[[half-caste]]&quot; individuals varied over time. A 1913 report by Sir [[Walter Baldwin Spencer|Baldwin Spencer]] states that:
{{quote|the half-castes belong neither to the aboriginal nor to the whites, yet, on the whole, they have more leaning towards the former; ... One thing is certain and that is that the white population as a whole will never mix with half-castes... the best and kindest thing is to place them on reserves along with the natives, train them in the same schools and encourage them to marry amongst themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.aus-vn5548412 |title=Preliminary Report on the Aboriginals of the Northern Territory| first=Sir Bernard |last=Spencer |date=20 May 1913 |page=21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the [[First World War]], however, it became apparent that the number of mixed-race people was growing at a faster rate than the white population, and by 1930 fear of the &quot;half-caste menace&quot; undermining the [[White Australia Policy|White Australia]] ideal from within was being taken as a serious concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://arts.gov.au/sites/default/files/funding/awards/pmla/2012/first-chapters/Indifferent-inclusions-%28Chap1%29.pdf |title=Indifferent Inclusion: Aboriginal People and the Australian Nation |first=Russell |last=McGregor |publisher=Aboriginal Studies Press |year=2012 |chapter=1 |pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Cecil Cook (Australia)|Cecil Cook]], the [[Northern Territory]] [[Protector of Aborigines|Protector of Natives]], noted that:

The second half of the 20th century to the present has seen a gradual shift towards improved human rights for Aboriginal people. Aborigines were given the right to vote in 1962, and in the [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum]] over 90% of the Australian population voted to end constitutional discrimination and to include Aborigines in the national [[census]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://australianmuseum.net.au/Indigenous-Australia-Timeline-1901-to-1969 |title=Indigenous Australia Timeline – 1901 to 1969 |date=3 November 2011 |publisher=Australian Museum }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period many Aboriginal activists began to embrace the term &quot;black&quot; and use their ancestry as a source of pride. Activist [[Bob Maza]] said:

In 1978 Aboriginal writer [[Kevin Gilbert (author)|Kevin Gilbert]] received the National Book Council award for his book ''Living Black: Blacks Talk to Kevin Gilbert'', a collection of Aboriginal people's stories, and in 1998 was awarded (but refused to accept) the Human Rights Award for Literature for ''Inside Black Australia'', a poetry anthology and exhibition of Aboriginal photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://teaching.austlit.edu.au/?q=node/12205 | title=Gilbert, Kevin |publisher=Teaching Aust.

The overall composite nature of Yemeni gene pool also supports its probable role as a recipient of gene flows from different parts of Africa and Eurasia. However, the major haplogroups exhibit different distributions among regional samples (Fig. 2) with lineages specific to sub-Saharan Africa being significantly more frequent in Hadramawt (60.0%) than in the western Yemeni populations where the frequency gradually decreases from Hajja in the north (34.3%) through Tihama (28.4%) to Ta’izz in the south (16.3%); the opposite is true for West Eurasian lineages (Černý et al., 2008).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Abu-Amero/&gt; 16% in Oman-Qatar,&lt;ref name=Abu-Amero&gt;KK Abu-Amero, Mitochondrial DNA structure in the Arabian Peninsula (2008), www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/45:&quot;Sub-Saharan Africa L lineages in Saudi Arabia account for 10% of the total. χ2 analyses showed that there is not significant regional differentiation in this Country.

==South America and the Caribbean==
Approximately 12 million Africans were shipped to [[the Americas]] during the [[Atlantic slave trade]] from 1492 to 1888, with 11.5 million of those shipped to [[South America]] and the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Slavery Memorial, http://www.unslaverymemorial.org/history.html: &quot;Accurate figures are still not available but at a conservative estimate, using the figures that have been generated by the latest Slave Trade Database, of the estimated millions transported, Portugal dominated the trade with 5.8 million or 46%, while Great Britain transported 3.25 million or 26%, France accounted for 1.38 million or 11%, and Spain 1.06 million or 8%. So it is unmistakable, that the 4 leading colonial powers accounted for a combined total of 11.5 million Africans or 92 % of the overall trade. The remainder was transported by the US 305,326, the Netherlands 554,336, and Denmark/Baltic 111,041. There were several stages to the trade. During the first phase between 1501 and1600, an estimated 277,509 Africans or just 2 % of the overall trade, were sent to the Americas and Europe. During the 17th century, some 15 % or 1,875,631 Africans embarked for the Americas. The period from 1701 to the passage of the British Abolition Act in 1807 was the peak of the trade. Here an estimated 7,163,241 or 57% of the trafficking in Africans transpired, with the remaining 26 % or 3,204,935 occurring between 1808 and 1866.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil was the largest importer in the Americas, with 5.5 million African slaves imported, followed by the British Caribbean with 2.76 million, the Spanish Caribbean and Spanish Mainland with 1.59 million Africans, and the French Caribbean with 1.32 million.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Slavery Memorial, http://www.unslaverymemorial.org/history.html:&quot;In the Americas, Brazil was the largest importer of Africans, accounting for 5.5 million or 44%, the British Caribbean with 2.76 million or 22%, the French Caribbean 1.32 million, and the Spanish Caribbean and Spanish Mainland accounting for 1.59 million. The relatively high numbers for Brazil and the British Caribbean is largely a reflection of the dominance and continued expansion of the plantation system in those regions. Even more so, the inability of the enslaved population in these regions to reproduce meant that the replacement demand for laborers was significantly high. In other words, Africans were imported to make up the demographic deficit on the plantations.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Today their descendants number approximately 150 million in South America and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/galci/Archive.htm &quot;Community Outreach&quot; Seminar on Planning Process for SANTIAGO +5], ''Global Afro-Latino and Caribbean Initiative'', 4 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to skin color, other physical characteristics such as facial features and hair texture are often variously used in classifying peoples as black in South America and the Caribbean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Hispanic American Religious Cultures |page=386 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=GFrwuj-ZXMkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=skin%20tones&amp;f=false |first=Miguel A. |last=De La Torre | year=2009 |publisher=ABC-Clio |isbn=1598841394|quote=&quot;The ways of defining blackness range from characteristics of skin tones, hair textures, facial features...&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitten1998&quot;&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Norman E. |editor1-last=Whitten |editor2-first=Arlene |editor2-last=Torres |title=Blackness in Latin America and the Caribbean |year=1998 |publisher=Indiana University Press |page=161 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=mB-r3L3PMNEC&amp;dq=isbn%3A0253211948&amp;q=hair+texture#v=snippet&amp;q=hair%20texture&amp;f=false |isbn=0253211948 |quote=&quot;In still other instances, persons are counted in reference to equally ambiguous phenotypical variations, particularly skin color, facial features, or hair texture.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South America and the Caribbean, classification as black is also closely tied to social status and socioeconomic variables, especially in light of social conceptions of &quot;[[blanqueamiento]]&quot; ([[racial whitening]]) and related concepts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitten1998&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Tanya Kateri last=Hernandez |year=2012 |page=20 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=e_ARE8CLMToC&amp;dq=isbn%3A1107024862&amp;q=blanqueamiento+#v=snippet&amp;q=blanqueamiento&amp;f=false |isbn=1107024862 |quote=&quot;Given the larger numbers of persons of African and indigenous descent in Spanish America, the region developed its own form of eugenics with the concepts of blanqueamiento (whitening)...blanqueamiento was meant to benefit the entire nation with a white image, and not just individual persons of African descent seeking access to the legal rights and privileges of colonial whites.&quot;|title = Racial Subordination in Latin America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Race in Brazil|Afro-Brazilian}}
[[File:Negro fandango scene.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Jongo]], a Brazilian dance of African origin, c. 1822]]
The topic of race in Brazil is complex. A Brazilian child was never automatically identified with the racial type of one or both parents, nor were there only two categories to choose from. Between a pure black and a very light [[mulatto]], more than a dozen racial categories were acknowledged, based on combinations of [[Human hair color|hair color]], [[Hair#Hair_Texture|hair texture]], [[eye color]], and [[Human skin color|skin color]]. These types grade into each other like the colors of the spectrum, and no one category stands significantly isolated from the rest. That is, race has referred to appearance, not heredity.&lt;ref name=&quot;skidmore&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| first = Thomas E. | last = Skidmore | title = Fact and Myth: Discovering a Racial Problem in Brazil| journal = Working Paper| volume = 173|url=http://www.nd.edu/~kellogg/publications/workingpapers/WPS/173.pdf|date=April 1992|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars disagree over the effects of social status on racial classifications in Brazil. It is generally believed that [[Social mobility|upward mobility]] and education results in reclassification of individuals into lighter-skinned categories. The popular claim is that in Brazil, poor whites are considered black and wealthy blacks are considered white. Some scholars disagree, arguing that [[Racial whitening|whitening]] of one's social status may be open to people of mixed race, but a typically black person will consistently be identified as black regardless of wealth or social status.&lt;ref name=Telles&gt;{{cite book| last = Edward E. | first = Telles| title = Race in Another America: The Significance of Skin Color in Brazil| pages = 95–98| publisher = [[Princeton University Press]]| year= 2004| isbn =0-691-11866-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first = Edward E. | last = Telles| title = Racial Ambiguity Among the Brazilian Population| journal = Ethnic and Racial Studies|url=http://www.ccpr.ucla.edu/ccprwpseries/ccpr_012_01.pdf| volume = 25| pages = 415–441| date= 3 May 2002| publisher = California Center for Population Research| doi = 10.1080/01419870252932133|format=PDF| issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the year 1500 to 1850, an estimated 3.5 million Africans were forcibly shipped to Brazil.&lt;ref name=Telles/&gt; It is estimated that more than half of the Brazilian population is at least in part descendants of these Africans. Brazil has the largest population of Afro-descendants outside of Africa. In contrast to the US, there were no segregation or anti-[[miscegenation]] laws in Brazil. Intermarriage has been popular for centuries. Much of the white/Asian population also has either African or Amerindian blood. According to the last census of the twentieth century, 54% identified themselves as white, 6.2% identified themselves as black, and 39.5% identified themselves as [[Pardo]] (brown)&amp;nbsp;— a broad multi-racial category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = CIA World Factbook: Brazil| url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/br.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A philosophy of [[racial whitening]] emerged in Brazil in the nineteenth century. Until recently the government did not keep data on race. However, statisticians estimate that in 1835 half the population was black, one fifth was Pardo (brown) and one fourth white. By 2000, the black population had fallen to 6.2%, the Pardo had increased to 40%, and white to 55%. Essentially most of the black population was absorbed into the multi-racial category by intermixing.&lt;ref name=&quot;skidmore&quot;/&gt; A 2007 study found that at least 29% of the middle-class, white Brazilian population had some recent (since the colonial period) African ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.funpecrp.com.br/gmr/year2007/vol2-6/gmr0330_full_text.htm &quot;Sex-biased gene flow in African Americans but not in American Caucasians&quot;], ''GMR,'' 2007, Vol. 12 No. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

====Race relations in Brazil====
[[File:Ogum.JPG|thumb|right|Brazilian [[Candomblé]] ceremony]]
Because of the ideology of [[miscegenation]], Brazil has avoided the polarization of society into black and white. The bitter and sometimes violent racial tensions that divide the US are notably absent in Brazil. According to the 2010 census, 6.7% of Brazilians said they were black, compared with 6.2% in 2000, and 43.1% said they were mixed race, up from 38.5%. In 2010, Elio Ferreira de Araujo, Brazil's minister for racial equality, attributed the change to growing pride among his country's black and indigenous communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian.co.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/25/brazil-2010-census-kalunga &quot;Brazil's census offers recognition at last to descendants of runaway slaves&quot;], ''Guardian''&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy of the racial democracy in Brazil has drawn criticism from some quarters. Brazil has one of the largest gaps in income distribution in the world. The richest 10% of the population earn 28 times the average income of the bottom 40%. The richest 10 percent is almost exclusively white. One-third of the population lives under the poverty line, with blacks and other non-whites accounting for 70 percent of the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Barrolle| first = Melvin Kadiri| title = African 'Americans' in Brazil| publisher =New America Media| url=http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=5b8d531de860940110af2433244782c6| accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, black people earn 75% of what white people earn.&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/nov/17/brazil-census-african-brazilians-majority Tom Phillips, &quot;Brazil census shows African-Brazilians in the majority for the first time&quot;], ''The Guardian'', 17 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In Brazil, non-whites earn less than 50% of what whites earn. Some have posited that Brazil practices the [[one-drop rule]] when analysts consider the facts of social and economic divisions. The gap in income between blacks and other non-whites is relatively small compared to the large gap between whites and non-whites. Other factors, such as illiteracy and education levels, show the same patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Roland| first = Edna Maria Santos| title = The Economics of Racism: People of African Descent in Brazil| url=http://www.falapreta.org.br/durban/racism.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike in the US, where African Americans were united in the civil-rights struggle, in Brazil the philosophy of whitening has helped divide blacks from other non-whites and prevented a more active civil rights movement.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Though Brazilians of African heritage make up a large percentage&lt;ref name=Phillips /&gt; of the population there are very few black politicians. The city of [[Salvador, Bahia]], for instance, is 80% Afro-Brazilian but has never had a black mayor. Critics indicate that US cities that have a black majority, such as [[Detroit]] and [[New Orleans]], have never had white mayors since first electing black mayors in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian.co.uk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Whitaker, &quot;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_n4_v46/ai_9329550/pg_3 Blacks in Brazil: The Myth and the Reality]&quot;, ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'', February 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Jean Baptiste Debret - Loja de barbeiros, 1821.jpg|thumb|Black people in Brazil c. 1821]]
Non-white people also have limited media visibility. The Latin American media, in particular the Brazilian media, has been accused of hiding its Black, Indigenous, Multiracial and East Asian population. For example the [[telenovelas]] or [[Soap Opera|soaps]] are said to be a hotbed of largely [[blond]] and [[Eye color|light-eyed]] [[white Brazilian|white]] (they resemble [[Scandinavia]]ns and other [[northern Europe]]ans more than they look like white Brazilians of typical [[Southern Europe]]an features) and [[White people#Brazil|light-skinned mulatto and mestizo]] (often deemed as white persons in Brazil if achieving the middle class or higher social status) actors. Most rare empowered persons of color represented in Latin American media possess typically Caucasian features due to a mix of racist standards of [[beauty]], [[colourism]] and [[lookism]]. Nevertheless, in the last years, the number of empowered afrodescendants (either economically or by other ways) increased in Brazilian media coverage. Despite Brazil also possessing [[criminal black man stereotype]]s, it is considered a huge prejudice and mostly not used in a disordered way by the media, in spite of sometimes common &quot;humouristic&quot; [[sexist joke]]s and [[LGBT stereotypes|LGBT stereotyping]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Maria Berenice&quot;&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://mariaberenice.com.br/pt/estereotipo-vexatorio-em-programas-humoristicos-e-homofobia--diz-maria-berenice.cont Vexing stereotypes in humouristic shows is homophobia, lawyer Maria Berenice says]. Maria Berenice Dias &quot;homoaffective&quot; (LGBT) rights, Family Law and Succession lawyer blog, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and as such lack of [[politically correct]]ness in native race issues is not a major problem (there are more stereotypes of Asian people, Europeans or U.S. Americans, for example).{{Citation needed|date = April 2014}}

These patterns of discrimination against non-whites have led some to advocate for the use of the Portuguese term 'negro' to encompass non-whites so as to renew a black consciousness and identity, in effect an African descent rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newamerica.net/publications/articles/2006/brazil_separates_into_a_world_of_black_and_white &quot;Brazil Separates Into a World of Black and White&quot;], ''Los Angeles Times'', 3 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It generates criticism since [[Pardo]], or [[Brown people]], is intended to include [[caboclo]]s (mestizos), assimilated Amerindians and tri-racials, not only afrodescendants&amp;nbsp;— thus Brazilian of some or no recent African descent, as most White Brazilians, become 60–70% of the population, breaking the argument of possible Brazilian one-drop rule since real noticeable mulattoes, [[cafuzo]]s (zambos) and black persons are a minority and the Brazilian poor represents larger percents in Brazil. As one would expect from an underdeveloped country, there are pockets of poverty in White-majority and [[Japanese Brazilian]]-majority areas, rarer in urban developments but common in rural areas. They are even more common among Mestizo-majority areas, and Amerindian communities.

In the first 200 years that black people were in the [[United States]], they commonly referred to themselves as Africans. In Africa, people primarily identified themselves by [[ethnic groups of Africa|ethnic group]] (closely allied to language) and not by skin color. Individuals identified themselves, for example, as [[The Ashanti|Ashanti]], [[Igbo people|Igbo]], [[Kongo people|Bakongo]], or [[Wolof people|Wolof]], and others. But when Africans were brought to [[the Americas]], they were often combined with other groups from Africa, and individual ethnic affiliations were not generally acknowledged by English colonists. In areas of the Upper South, different ethnic groups were brought together. This is significant as Africans came from a vast geographic region: the [[West Africa]]n coastline stretching from [[Senegal]] to [[Angola]] and in some cases from the south-east coast such as [[Mozambique]]. A new identity and culture was born that incorporated elements of the various ethnic groups and of European cultural heritage, resulting in fusions such as the [[Black church]] and [[AAVE|Black English]]. This new identity was based on African ancestry and slave status rather than membership in any one ethnic group.&lt;ref name=Shahadah&gt;{{cite web| last = Shahadah| first = Owen 'Alik| authorlink =Owen 'Alik Shahadah| title =Linguistics for a new African reality| url=http://www.africanholocaust.net/news_ah/language%20new%20reality.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, slave records from Louisiana show that the French and Spanish colonists recorded more complete identities of Africans, including ethnicities and given tribal names.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books/about/Africans_in_Colonial_Louisiana.html?id=Arybfb4UWtwC Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, ''Africans in Colonial Louisiana: The Development of Afro-Creole Culture in the Eighteenth Century''], Louisiana State University Press, 1992/1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The US racial or ethnic classification &quot;black&quot; refers to people with all possible kinds of skin pigmentation, from the darkest through to the very lightest skin colors, including [[albinos]], if they are believed by others to have African ancestry (in any discernible percentage), or to exhibit cultural traits associated with being &quot;[[African American]]&quot;. As a result, in the United States the term &quot;black people&quot; is not an indicator of skin color but of socially based racial classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last =Glenn |first =Evelyn Nakano |year = 2009|title =Shades of difference: why skin color matters |url =http://books.google.ca/books?id=WewhspE2Q9UC&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;dq=Shades%20of%20difference%3A%20why%20skin%20color%20matters&amp;pg=PA225#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true|page=225 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-5998-4|accessdate = |postscript =&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

In March 1807, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], which largely controlled the Atlantic, declared [[Slave Trade Act 1807|the transatlantic slave trade illegal]], as did the United States. (The latter prohibition took effect 1 January 1808, the earliest date on which [[United States Congress|Congress]] had the power to do so after protecting the slave trade under [[wikisource:Constitution of the United States of America#Section 9|Article I, Section 9]] of the [[United States Constitution]].)

By that time, the majority of black people in the United States were native-born, so the use of the term &quot;African&quot; became problematic. Though initially a source of pride, many blacks feared the use of African as an identity would be a hindrance to their fight for full citizenship in the US. They also felt that it would give ammunition to those who were advocating repatriating black people back to Africa. In 1835, black leaders called upon black Americans to remove the title of &quot;African&quot; from their institutions and replace it with &quot;[[Negro]]&quot; or &quot;Colored American&quot;. A few institutions chose to keep their historic names, such as the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]]. African Americans popularly used the terms &quot;Negro&quot; or &quot;colored&quot; for themselves until the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1594200831/ ''African American Journeys to Africa''], pp. 63–64&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''black'' was used throughout but not frequently since it carried a certain stigma.
In his 1963 &quot;[[I Have a Dream]]&quot; speech,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1732754907698549493 | people = Martin Luther King, Jr.| title = I Have a Dream| medium = Google Video| location = Washington, D.C.|date=28 August 1963 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] uses the terms ''negro'' fifteen times and ''black'' four times. Each time he uses ''black'' it is in parallel construction with ''white'', for example, &quot;black men and white men&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Smith|first= Tom W.|title = Changing Racial Labels: From &quot;Colored&quot; to &quot;Negro&quot; to &quot;Black&quot; to &quot;African American&quot;| journal = The Public Opinion Quarterly| volume = 56| issue=4|pages = 496–514|oclc=192150485| url=http://www.soc.iastate.edu/soc522a/PDF%20readings/Smith.pdf|date = Winter 1992| publisher = Oxford University Press| doi = 10.1086/269339|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the successes of the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights movement]], a new term was needed to break from the past and help shed the reminders of legalized discrimination. In place of ''Negro'', activists promoted the use of ''black'' as standing for racial pride, militancy, and power. Some of the turning points included the use of the term &quot;[[Black Power]]&quot; by Kwame Toure ([[Stokely Carmichael]]) and the popular singer [[James Brown]]'s song &quot;[[Say It Loud - I'm Black and I'm Proud]]&quot;.
[[File:Jordan by Lipofsky 16577.jpg|thumb|left|[[Michael Jordan]], an African American considered by many to be the greatest basketball player in history.]]
In 1988, the civil rights leader [[Jesse Jackson]] urged Americans to use the term &quot;African American&quot; because it had a historical cultural base and was a construction similar to terms used by European descendants, such as German American, Italian American, etc. Since then, African American and black have had essentially coequal status. Controversy continues over which term is more appropriate. [[Maulana Karenga]] and [[Owen Alik Shahadah]] argue African-American is more appropriate because it accurately articulates geographical and historical origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shahadah&quot;/&gt; Others have argued that &quot;black&quot; is a better term because &quot;African&quot; suggests foreignness, although black people have been in the US since the earliest colonial years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = McWhorter| first = John H.| title = Why I'm Black, Not African American| work= Los Angeles Times|date=8 September 2004| url = http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/_latimes-why_im_black.htm| accessdate =26 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still others believe the term black is inaccurate because African Americans have a variety of skin tones.&lt;ref name=Relethford2000&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Relethford |first1=JH |title=Human skin color diversity is highest in sub-Saharan African populations |journal=Human Biology; an international record of research |volume=72 |issue=5 |pages=773–80 |year=2000 |pmid=11126724}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shriver2003&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pages=387–399 |doi=10.1007/s00439-002-0896-y |url=http://backintyme.com/admixture/shriver01.pdf | pmid=12579416 |volume=112 |issue=4 |title=Skin pigmentation, biogeographical ancestry and admixture mapping |date=April 2003 |author=Shriver M.D., Parra E.J., Dios S. |journal=Human Genetics|author2=and others |displayauthors=1 |doi_brokendate=2015-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys show that the majority of black Americans have no preference for &quot;African American&quot; or &quot;Black&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/28816/black-african-american.aspx|title=Black or African American?|first=Frank|last=Newport|publisher=Gallup|date=28 September 2007|accessdate=26 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although they have a slight preference for &quot;black&quot; in personal settings and &quot;African American&quot; in more formal settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Miller| first1 = Pepper| last2 = Kemp|first2=Herb | title = What's Black About?

Increases in the number of black immigrants to the United States from [[African immigration to the United States|Africa]], the Caribbean, and Latin America since the late twentieth century have raised questions about who uses the term African American. The more recent African immigrants may sometimes view themselves, and be viewed, as culturally distinct from native-born Americans who descend from African slaves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swarns&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE5DB1F3EF93AA1575BC0A9629C8B63|title='African American' Becomes a Term for Debate|last=Swarns|first=Rachel L.|date=29 August 2004|work=The New York Times|accessdate=22 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Race (United States Census)|U.S. census race definitions]] says a &quot;black&quot; is a person having origins in any of the black (sub-Saharan) racial groups of Africa. It includes people who indicate their race as &quot;Black, African Am., or Negro&quot; or who provide written entries such as African American, Afro-American, [[Kenyan]], [[Nigerian]], or [[Haiti]]an. The [[Census Bureau]] notes that these classifications are socio-political constructs and should not be interpreted as scientific or anthropological.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.gov/mso/www/c2000basics/00Basics.pdf 2000 US Census basics]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:FlagsOverStilwellRoad.gif|thumb|right|190px|A black Gl and a Chinese soldier place the flag of their ally on the front of their jeep, truck convoy on the [[Stilwell Road]], Burma, 1945]]
A considerable portion of the [[U.S. population]] identified as ''black'' also has [[Europe]]an ancestry in varying amounts; a lesser proportion have some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] ancestry. For instance, genetic studies of African-American people show an ancestry that is on average 17–18% European.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isteve.com/2002_How_White_Are_Blacks.htm Steve Sailer, &quot;How White Are Blacks? How Black Are Whites?&quot;], iSteve, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===One-drop rule===
From the late nineteenth century, the South used a [[colloquial]] term, the ''[[one-drop rule]]'', to classify as black a person of any known African ancestry. This practice of hypodescent was not put into law until the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;{{cite web| last = James| first = F. Davis| title = Who is Black? One Nation's Definition| url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jefferson/mixed/onedrop.html| publisher = [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legally the definition varied from state to state. Racial definition was more flexible in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries before the [[American Civil War]]. For instance, President [[Thomas Jefferson]] held persons who were legally white (less than 25% black) according to Virginia law at the time, but, because they were born to slave mothers, they were born into slavery, according to the principle of ''[[partus sequitur ventrem]]'', which Virginia adopted into law in 1662.

Outside of the US, some other countries have adopted the one-drop rule, but the definition of who is black and the extent to which the one-drop &quot;rule&quot; applies varies greatly from country to country.

The one-drop rule may have originated as a means of increasing the number of black slaves&lt;ref&gt;[[Clarence Page]], [http://www.pbs.org/newshour/essays/page_5-1.html A Credit to His Races], ''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]'', 1 May 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and was maintained as an attempt to keep the white race pure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://backintyme.com/essays/?p=25|title=Presenting the Triumph of the One-Drop Rule|last=Sweet|first=Frank|date=1 April 2006|work=The One-Drop Rule|accessdate=22 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the results of the one-drop rule was the uniting of the African-American community.&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt; Some of the most prominent abolitionists and civil-rights activists of the nineteenth century were multiracial, such as [[Frederick Douglass]], [[Robert Purvis]], and James Mercer Langston. They advocated equality for all.

The concept of blackness in the United States has been described as the degree to which one associates themselves with mainstream [[African American culture]], politics,&lt;ref name=Eze&gt; Chielozona Eze, Postcolonial Imaginations and Moral Representations (2011), p. 25, books.google.com/books?isbn=0739145088:&quot;For Du Bois, blackness is political, it is existential, but above all, it is moral, for in it values abound; these values spring from the fact of being an oppressed.&quot; &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Olson&gt;Barbara Olson, The Final Days (2003), p. 58, books.google.com/books?isbn=0895261251:&quot;In fact, Bill Clinton had promoted an even worse variation, that authentic blackness is political...&quot; &lt;/ref&gt; and values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=OLATUNDE|first=ALLEN TIMILEHIN|title=MISSIONS IN THE DARK SOIL: Life and Work of Thomas Jefferson Bowen in Africa|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=BnnTBQAAQBAJ|publisher=aiconcept|isbn=978-978-52387-6-1|page=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=BnnTBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA92 92]}}&lt;/ref&gt; To a certain extent, this concept is not so much about race but more about political orientation,&lt;ref name=Eze/&gt;&lt;ref name=Olson/&gt; culture and behavior.

Due to the often political&lt;ref name=Eze/&gt;&lt;ref name=Olson/&gt; and cultural contours of blackness in the United States, the notion of blackness can also be extended to non-black people.

In July 2012, Ancestry.com reported on historic and [[DNA]] research by its staff that discovered that Obama is likely a descendant through his mother of [[John Punch (slave)|John Punch]], considered by some historians to be the first African slave in the [[Virginia]] colony. An [[indentured servant]], he was &quot;bound for life&quot; in 1640 after trying to escape. The story of him and his descendants is that of multi-racial America since it appeared he and his sons married or had unions with white women, likely indentured servants and working class like them. Their [[multi-racial]] children were free because they were born to free [[English people|English]] women. Over time, Obama's line of the Bunch family (as they became known) were property owners and continued to &quot;marry white&quot;; they became part of white society, likely by the early to mid-eighteenth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harman&quot;&gt;[http://c.mfcreative.com/offer/us/obama_bunch/PDF/main_article_final.pdf Anastasia Harman, Natalie D.
