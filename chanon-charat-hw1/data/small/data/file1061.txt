'''Sir Alfred Jules''' &quot;'''Freddie'''&quot; '''Ayer''' ({{IPAc-en|ɛə}}; 29 October 1910 – 27 June 1989)&lt;ref name=&quot;BioDict20CPhil&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Biographical Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Philosophers |year=1996 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |pages=37–39 |isbn=0-415-06043-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a British philosopher known for his promotion of [[logical positivism]], particularly in his books ''[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]'' (1936) and ''The Problem of Knowledge'' (1956).

Ayer was a [[Special Operations Executive]] and [[MI6]] agent during the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The politics of apolitical culture: the Congress for Cultural Freedom, the CIA, and post-war American hegemony |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |author=Scott-Smith, Giles |page=109 |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-24445-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the [[Grote Chair of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic|Grote Professor of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic]] at [[University College London]] from 1946 until 1959, when he became [[Wykeham Professor]] of Logic at the [[University of Oxford]]. He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1951 to 1952. He was [[knight]]ed in 1970.

== Life ==
Ayer was born in [[St John's Wood|St John's Wood, London]], to a wealthy family from continental Europe. His mother, Reine Citroën, was from the [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jewish]] family who founded the [[Citroën]] car company in France. His father, Jules Ayer, was a Swiss [[Calvinist]] financier who worked for the [[Rothschild family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A.J. Ayer: A Life |author= Rogers, Ben |publisher= Vintage |location =London |year=2000 |origyear=1999 |pages= |isbn= 978-0-09-953681-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at [[Ascham St Vincent's School|Ascham St Vincent's Preparatory School]] and [[Eton College|Eton]]. It was at Eton that Ayer first became known for his characteristic bravado and precocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= A.J. Ayer: A Life |author= Rogers, Ben |publisher= Vintage |location =London |year=2000 |origyear=1999 |pages=42–44 |isbn= 978-0-09-953681-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final examinations at Eton, Ayer came second in his year, and first in classics. In his final year, as a member of Eton's senior council, he unsuccessfully campaigned for the abolition of [[School corporal punishment|corporal punishment]] at the school. He won a classics scholarship to [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. He served as an officer in the [[Welsh Guards]] during [[World War II]], working for the [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) and spying for [[MI6]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/sep/21/mi6-first-authorised-history |location=London |work =The Guardian |first=Richard |last=Norton-Taylor |title=Graham Greene, Arthur Ransome and Somerset Maugham all spied for Britain, admits MI6 |date=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an extrovert, and social mixer, and was married four times, including to Dee Wells and Vanessa Salmon (thus becoming stepfather to [[Nigella Lawson]]). Reputedly he liked dancing and attending the clubs in London and New York. He was also obsessed with sport: he had played rugby for Eton, and was a noted cricketer and a keen supporter of the [[Tottenham Hotspur]] football team. For an academic, Ayer was an unusually well-connected figure in his time, with close links to 'high-society' and the establishment. Presiding over Oxford high-tables, he is often described as charming, but at times he could also be intimidating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Iris Murdoch as I knew her |first=A. N. |last=Wilson |publisher= Hutchinson |year=2003 |page=156 |location =London |isbn= 978-0-09-174246-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Language, Truth and Logic'' (1936), Ayer rejected [[atheism]] on the grounds that any religious discourse was meaningless. He believed that religious language was unverifiable and as such literally nonsense. Consequently &quot;There is no God&quot; was for Ayer as meaningless and metaphysical an utterance as &quot;God exists.&quot; Though Ayer could not give assent to the declaration &quot;There is no God,&quot; he was a nontheist in that he withheld assent from affirmations of God's existence. In &quot;Language, Truth and Logic&quot; he distinguishes himself from both agnostics and atheists by saying that both these stances take the statement &quot;God exists&quot; as a meaningful hypothesis, which Ayer himself does not.  He also criticises C. A. Mace's opinion&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Representation and Expression,&quot; Analysis, Vol.1, No.3; &quot;Metaphysics and Emotive Language,&quot; Analysis Vol. II, nos. 1 and 2,&lt;/ref&gt; that metaphysics is a form of intellectual poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Language, Truth and Logic 1946/1952, New York/Dover&lt;/ref&gt; The stance of a person who believes &quot;God&quot; denotes no verifiable hypothesis is sometimes referred to as [[Ignosticism|igtheism]] (for example, by [[Paul Kurtz]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The New Skepticism: Inquiry and Reliable Knowledge |page=194 |author=Kurtz, Paul |authorlink=Paul Kurtz |year=1992 |publisher=Prometheus |location =Buffalo, NY |isbn= 978-0-87975-766-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years Ayer reiterated that he did not believe in God&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I do not believe in God. It seems to me that theists of all kinds have very largely failed to make their concept of a deity intelligible; and to the extent that they have made it intelligible, they have given us no reason to think that anything answers to it.&quot; Ayer, A.J. (1966). &quot;What I Believe,&quot; ''Humanist'', Vol.81 (8) August, p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt; and began to refer to himself as an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I trust that my remaining an atheist will allay the anxieties of my fellow supporters of the [[British Humanist Association]], the [[Rationalist Press Association]] and the [[South Place Ethical Society]].&quot; (Ayer 1989, p. 12)&lt;/ref&gt; He followed in the footsteps of [[Bertrand Russell]] by debating with the Jesuit scholar [[Frederick Copleston]] on the topic of religion.

Ayer's version of emotivism divides &quot;the ordinary system of ethics&quot; into four classes:
#&quot;Propositions that express definitions of ethical terms, or judgements about the legitimacy or possibility of certain definitions&quot;
#&quot;Propositions describing the phenomena of moral experience, and their causes&quot;
#&quot;Exhortations to moral virtue&quot;
#&quot;Actual ethical judgments&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, ''Language'', 103&lt;/ref&gt;
He focuses on propositions of the first class—moral judgments—saying that those of the second class belong to science, those of the third are mere commands, and those of the fourth (which are considered in [[normative ethics]] as opposed to [[meta-ethics]]) are too concrete for ethical philosophy. While class three statements were irrelevant to Ayer's brand of emotivism, they would later play a significant role in Stevenson's.

Ayer argues that moral judgments cannot be translated into non-ethical, empirical terms and thus cannot be verified; in this he agrees with [[ethical intuitionism|ethical intuitionists]]. But he differs from intuitionists by discarding appeals to intuition as &quot;worthless&quot; for determining moral truths,&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, ''Language'', 106&lt;/ref&gt; since the intuition of one person often contradicts that of another. Instead, Ayer concludes that ethical concepts are &quot;mere pseudo-concepts&quot;:

{{quote|The presence of an ethical symbol in a proposition adds nothing to its factual content. Thus if I say to someone, &quot;You acted wrongly in stealing that money,&quot; I am not stating anything more than if I had simply said, &quot;You stole that money.&quot; In adding that this action is wrong I am not making any further statement about it. I am simply evincing my moral disapproval of it. It is as if I had said, &quot;You stole that money,&quot; in a peculiar tone of horror, or written it with the addition of some special exclamation marks. … If now I generalise my previous statement and say, &quot;Stealing money is wrong,&quot; I produce a sentence that has no factual meaning—that is, expresses no proposition that can be either true or false. … I am merely expressing certain moral sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, ''Language'', 107&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Between 1945 and 1947, together with Russell and [[George Orwell]], he contributed a series of articles to ''[[Polemic (magazine)|Polemic]]'', a short-lived British &quot;Magazine of Philosophy, Psychology, and Aesthetics&quot; edited by the ex-Communist [[Humphrey Slater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/arthistorical-notes-where-are-the-hirsts-of-the-1930s-now-1184514.html |title= Where are the Hirsts of the 1930s now? |work=The Independent |location =London |date=13 November 1998 |author=Buckman, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Absent Minds&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url= http://books.google.es/books?id=j-OjW2JvVfAC&amp;pg=PA396&amp;vq=ayer&amp;cad=1_1#PPA396,M1 |title= Absent Minds: Intellectuals in Britain |author= Collini, Stefan |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn= 978-0-19-929105-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ayer was closely associated with the British [[secular humanism|humanist]] movement. He was an Honorary Associate of the [[Rationalist Press Association]] from 1947 until his death. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1963.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 April 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110510021801/http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf| archivedate= 10 May 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, he became the first president of the Agnostics' Adoption Society and in the same year succeeded [[Julian Huxley]] as president of the [[British Humanist Association]], a post he held until 1970. In 1968 he edited ''The Humanist Outlook'', a collection of essays on the meaning of humanism. In addition he was one of the signers of the [[Humanist Manifesto II|Humanist Manifesto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_II | title=Humanist Manifesto II | publisher=American Humanist Association | accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught or lectured several times in the United States, including serving as a visiting professor at [[Bard College]] in the fall of 1987. At a party that same year held by fashion designer [[Fernando Sanchez]], Ayer, then 77, confronted [[Mike Tyson]] who was forcing himself upon the (then) little-known model [[Naomi Campbell]]. When Ayer demanded that Tyson stop, the boxer said: &quot;Do you know who the fuck I am? I'm the heavyweight champion of the world,&quot; to which Ayer replied: &quot;And I am the former [[Wykeham Professor of Logic]]. We are both pre-eminent in our field. I suggest that we talk about this like rational men&quot;. Ayer and Tyson then began to talk, while Naomi Campbell slipped out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=D26bGPQw0GsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A.+J.+Ayer&amp;ei=ECIPTKLSL4WyzgSbpJiaCg&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=naomi&amp;f=false Rogers (1999), p. 344].&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1959 to his retirement in 1978, Sir Alfred held the Wykham Chair, Professor of Logic at Oxford. He was knighted in 1970.

Ayer died on 27 June 1989. From 1980 – 1989, Ayer lived at 51 York Street, [[Marylebone]], where a memorial plaque was unveiled on 19 November 1995.&lt;ref&gt;City of Westminster green plaques http://www.westminster.gov.uk/services/leisureandculture/greenplaques/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Ayer was married four times to three women.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Wollheim|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first marriage was from 1932–1941 to (Grace Isabel) Renée (d. 1980), who subsequently married philosopher [[Stuart Hampshire]], Ayer's friend and colleague.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; In 1960 he married Alberta Constance (Dee) Wells (1925–2003), with whom he had one son.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; Ayer's marriage to Wells was dissolved in 1983 and that same year he married Vanessa Mary Addison, former wife of politician [[Nigel Lawson]]. She died in 1985 and in 1989 he remarried Dee Wells, who survived him.&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt; Ayer also had a daughter with Hollywood columnist [[Sheilah Graham Westbrook]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ODNB&quot;/&gt;

=== Near-death experience ===
In 1988, shortly before his death, Ayer wrote an article entitled, &quot;What I saw when I was dead&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ayer |first=A. J. |url=http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Ayer-What-I-Saw-When-I-Was-Dead.pdf |title=What I Saw When I Was Dead |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; describing an unusual [[near-death experience]]. Of the experience, Ayer first said that it &quot;slightly weakened my conviction that my genuine death ... will be the end of me, though I continue to hope that it will be.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Lougrhan |first=Gerry |title=Can There Be Life After Life? Ask the Atheist! |date=18 March 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few days later he revised this, saying &quot;what I should have said is that my experiences have weakened, not my belief that there is no life after death, but my inflexible attitude towards that belief&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dennett |first=Daniel C. |url=http://edge.org/3rd_culture/dennett06/dennett06_index.html |title=THANK GOODNESS! |publisher=Edge.org |date=3 November 2006 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Dr Jeremy George, the attending physician, claimed that Ayer had confided to him: &quot;I saw a Divine Being. I'm afraid I'm going to have to revise all my books and opinions.&quot; Ayer's son Nick, however, said that he had never mentioned this to him though he did find his father's words to be extraordinary, and said he had long felt there was something possibly suspect about his father's version of his near death experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cash |first=William |url=http://variousenthusiasms.wordpress.com/2009/04/28/did-atheist-philosopher-see-god-when-he-died-by-william-cash/ |title=Did atheist philosopher see God when he 'died'? |publisher=National Post |date=28 April 2009 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
Ayer is best known for popularising the [[verification principle]], in particular through his presentation of it in ''[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]'' (1936). The principle was at the time at the heart of the debates of the so-called [[Vienna Circle]] which Ayer visited as a young guest. Others, including the leading light of the circle, [[Moritz Schlick]], were already offering their own papers on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schlick |first=Moritz |url=http://www.the-philosopher.co.uk/moritz.htm |title=Unanswerable Questions |publisher=The Philosopher |volume=XIII |year=1935 |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayer's own formulation was that a sentence can only be meaningful if it has verifiable [[empirical]] import, otherwise it is either &quot;[[Analytic-synthetic distinction|analytical]]&quot; if [[Tautology (logic)|tautologous]], or &quot;metaphysical&quot; (i.e. meaningless, or &quot;literally senseless&quot;). He started to work on the book at the age of 23&lt;ref&gt;page ix, &quot;Language, Truth and Logic&quot;, Penguin, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; and it was published when he was 26. Ayer's philosophical ideas were deeply influenced by those of the Vienna Circle and [[David Hume]]. His clear, vibrant and polemical exposition of them makes ''Language, Truth and Logic'' essential reading on the tenets of [[logical empiricism]]– the book is regarded as a classic of 20th century [[analytic philosophy]], and is widely read in philosophy courses around the world. In it, Ayer also proposed that the distinction between a conscious man and an unconscious machine resolves itself into a distinction between 'different types of perceptible behaviour',&lt;ref&gt;page 140, ''Language, Truth and Logic'', Penguin, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; an argument which anticipates the [[Turing test]] published in 1950 to test a machine's capability to demonstrate intelligence.

Ayer wrote two books on the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], ''Russell and Moore: The Analytic Heritage'' (1971) and ''Russell'' (1972). He also wrote an introductory book on the philosophy of [[David Hume]] and a short biography of [[Voltaire]].

Ayer was strong critic of the German philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]]. As a logical positivist Ayer was in conflict with Heidegger's proposed vast, overarching theories regarding existence. These he felt were completely unverifiable through empirical demonstration and logical analysis. This sort of philosophy was an unfortunate strain in modern thought. He considered Heidegger to be the worst example of such philosophy, which Ayer believed to be entirely useless.

In 1972–1973 Ayer gave the [[Gifford Lectures]] at [[University of St Andrews]], later published as ''The Central Questions of Philosophy''. In the preface to the book, he defends his selection to hold the lectureship on the basis that Lord Gifford wished to promote '&quot;Natural Theology&quot;, in the widest sense of that term', and that non-believers are allowed to give the lectures if they are &quot;able reverent men, true thinkers, sincere lovers of and earnest inquirers after truth&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Central Questions of Philosophy'', p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; He still believed in the viewpoint he shared with the logical positivists: that large parts of what was traditionally called &quot;philosophy&quot;– including the whole of [[metaphysics]], theology and [[aesthetics]]– were not matters that could be judged as being true or false and that it was thus meaningless to discuss them.

In &quot;The Concept of a Person and Other Essays&quot; (1963), Ayer heavily criticized [[Wittgenstein]]'s [[private language argument]].

Ayer's sense-data theory in ''Foundations of Empirical Knowledge'' was famously criticised by fellow Oxonian [[J. L. Austin]] in ''[[Sense and Sensibilia (Austin)|Sense and Sensibilia]]'', a landmark 1950s work of common language philosophy. Ayer responded to this in the essay &quot;Has Austin Refuted the Sense-data Theory?&quot;, which can be found in his ''Metaphysics and Common Sense'' (1969).
