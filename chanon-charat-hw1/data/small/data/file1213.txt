'''Afghan''' ([[Pashto language|Pashto]]/[[Persian language|Persian]]: افغان; see ''[[Afghan (ethnonym)|etymology]]'') refers to something from [[Afghanistan]], particularly a citizen of that country. Prior to this definition, it was used by Persian speakers and those influenced by the Persian language to denote the [[Pashtun people]]. In modern times, &quot;Afghan&quot; is rarely used as an ethnic term for the [[Pashtun People|Pashtuns]] but is rather used as the national [[demonym]] for all citizens of Afghanistan - [[Pashtun People|Pashtuns]], [[Tajik people|Tajiks]], [[Hazara people|Hazaras]], [[Uzbek people|Uzbeks]], [[Aimaq people|Aimaqs]], [[Turkmen people|Turkmens]], [[Baloch people|Balochs]], [[Nuristani people|Nuristanis]], [[Pashayi people|Pashayis]], [[Pamiri people|Pamiris]], [[History of Arabs in Afghanistan|Arabs]], [[Brahui people|Brahui]], [[Qezelbash]], [[Gurjar|Gujjar]] and others. 

According to [[Encyclopædia Iranica]], the word Afghan (afḡān) in current political usage means any citizen of Afghanistan, regardless of their tribal, or religious affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Encyclopædia Iranica|title=AFGHAN|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/afgan-in-current-political-usage-any-citizen-of-afghanistan-whatever-his-ethnic-tribal-or-religious-affiliation}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[1964 Afghanistan Constitution|1964 Constitution of Afghanistan]], all Afghans are equal in rights and obligations before the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article 1 of the 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan|url=http://www.afghan-web.com/history/const/const1964.html |publisher=Government of Afghanistan |accessdate=June 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fourth article of the current [[Constitution of Afghanistan]] states that citizens of Afghanistan consist of  [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]], [[Tajik people|Tajiks]], [[Hazara people|Hazara]], [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]], [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], [[Aymaq]], [[Arab]], [[Baloch people|Baluch]], [[Pashai people|Pashayi]], [[Nuristani people|Nuristani]], [[Qezelbash]], [[Gujjars]], [[Brahui people|Brahui]], and members of other tribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of Afghanistan|url=http://www.embassyofafghanistan.org/page/constitution |quote=National sovereignty in Afghanistan shall belong to the nation, manifested directly and through its elected representatives.

==Afghani==
The term &quot;Afghani&quot; refers to the unit of [[Afghan afghani|Afghan currency]]. It is often improperly used for a person or thing related to Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More on Afghani|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/chatterbox/2001/10/more_on_afghani.html |publisher=Slate.com|accessdate=March 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incorrect use of the term may have originated during the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]] when millions of Afghans took refuge in neighboring [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]].
