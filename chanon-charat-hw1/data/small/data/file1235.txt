==Overview==
In the May 1977 ''BYTE'', [[Steve Wozniak]] published a detailed description of his design; the article began, &quot;To me, a personal computer should be small, reliable, convenient to use and inexpensive&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wozniak197705&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1977-05/1977_05_BYTE_02-05_Interfacing#page/n35/mode/2up | title=System Description / The Apple-II | work=BYTE | date=May 1977 | accessdate=October 17, 2013 | author=Wozniak, Steve | pages=34–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original Apple II used [[data cassette]] storage like most other microcomputers of the time. In 1978 they introduced an external 5¼-inch [[floppy disk]] drive, the [[Disk II]], attached via a controller card that plugged into one of the computer's [[expansion slot]]s (usually slot 6), which was used for data storage and retrieval to replace cassettes. The Disk II interface, created by Wozniak, was regarded as an engineering masterpiece for its economy of electronic components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=5-The Disk II|url=http://apple2history.org/history/ah05.html|publisher=Apple II History | author=Steven Weyhrich|date=December 28, 2001|accessdate=November 16, 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061201122002/http://apple2history.org/history/ah05.html| archivedate= December 1, 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The approach taken in the Disk II controller was typical of Wozniak's designs. The Apple II used several engineering shortcuts to save hardware and reduce costs. For example, taking advantage of the way that 6502 instructions only access memory every other clock cycle, the video generation circuitry's memory access on the otherwise unused cycles avoided memory contention issues and also eliminated the need for a separate refresh circuit for the DRAM chips. Rather than use a complex analog-to-digital circuit to read the outputs of the game controller, Wozniak used a simple timer circuit whose period was proportional to the resistance of the game controller, and used a software loop to measure the timer.

The text and graphics screens had a complex arrangement (the scanlines were not stored in sequential areas of memory) which was reputedly due to Wozniak's realization that doing it that way would save a chip; it was less expensive to have software calculate or look up the address of the required scanline than to include the extra hardware. Similarly, in the high-resolution graphics mode, color was determined by pixel position and could thus be implemented in software, saving Wozniak the chips needed to convert bit patterns to colors. This also allowed for sub-pixel [[font]] rendering since orange and blue pixels appeared half a pixel-width farther to the right on the screen than green and purple pixels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grc.com/ctwho.htm |title=The origins of sub-pixel font rendering |publisher=Gibson Research Corporation |last=Gibson |first=Steve|accessdate=August 4, 2006 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060721130149/http://www.grc.com/ctwho.htm| archivedate= July 21, 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Display and graphics==
Color on the Apple II series took advantage of a quirk of the [[National Television System Committee|NTSC]] television signal standard, which made color display relatively easy and inexpensive to implement. The original NTSC television signal specification was black-and-white. Color was tacked on later by adding a 3.58-MHz subcarrier signal that was partially ignored by B&amp;W TV sets. Color is encoded based on the ''[[phase (waves)|phase]]'' of this signal in relation to a reference ''[[color burst]]'' signal. The result is that the position, size, and intensity of a series of pulses define color information. These pulses can translate into ''[[pixel]]s'' on the computer screen, with the possibility of exploiting [[composite artifact colors]].

The Apple II display provided two pixels per subcarrier cycle. When the color burst reference signal was turned on and the computer attached to a color display, it could display green by showing one alternating pattern of pixels, magenta with an opposite pattern of alternating pixels, and white by placing two pixels next to each other. Later, blue and orange became available by tweaking the offset of the pixels by half a pixel-width in relation to the color-burst signal. The high-resolution display offered more colors simply by compressing more, narrower pixels into each subcarrier cycle.

The coarse, low-resolution graphics display mode worked differently, as it could output a ''pattern'' of dots per pixel to offer more color options. These patterns were stored in the character generator ROM and replaced the text character bit patterns when the computer was switched to low-res graphics mode. The text mode and low-res graphics mode used the same memory region and the same circuitry was used for both.

==Sound==
Rather than having a dedicated sound-synthesis chip, the Apple II had a toggle circuit that could only emit a click through a built-in speaker or a line out jack; all other sounds (including two, three and, eventually, four-voice music and playback of audio samples and speech synthesis) were generated entirely by software that clicked the speaker at just the right times. It was nearly a decade before an Apple II was released with a dedicated sound chip (though with six expansion slots, users could add sound functionality with various [[Apple II sound cards|sound cards]]). Similar techniques were used for cassette storage: the cassette output worked the same as the speaker, and the input was a simple [[Zero crossing threshold detector|zero-crossing detector]] that served as a relatively crude (1-bit) audio digitizer. Routines in the ROM were used to encode and decode data in [[frequency-shift keying]] for the cassette.

==Third-party devices and applications==
Wozniak's open design and the Apple II's multiple expansion slots permitted a wide variety of third-party devices, including [[Apple II peripheral cards]] such as [[Apple II serial cards|serial controllers]], display controllers, memory boards, hard disks, networking components, and [[Apple II system clocks|realtime clocks]]. There were plug-in [[Apple II processor cards|expansion cards]] – such as the ''Z80-card''&lt;ref name=z80&gt;{{cite journal|work=[[InfoWorld]]|publisher=InfoWorld Media Group|date=February 6, 1984| issue=Vol. 6, Num. 6|quote=Several manufacturers, however, make Z80 coprocessor boards that plug into the Apple II.|page=64|title=Review: Premium Softcard IIe|last=Petersen|first=Marty}}&lt;/ref&gt; – that permitted the Apple to use the [[Zilog Z80|Z80]] processor and run a multitude of programs developed under the [[CP/M]] operating system,&lt;ref name=&quot;z80&quot;/&gt; including the [[dBase|dBase II]] database and the [[WordStar]] word processor. There was also a third-party [[Motorola 6809|6809]] card that would allow [[OS-9]] Level One to be run. Third-party [[Apple II sound cards|sound cards]] greatly improved audio capabilities, allowing simple music synthesis and text-to-speech functions. Eventually, [[Apple II accelerators|Apple II accelerator cards]] were created to double or quadruple the computer's speed.

==Power source==

Rod Holt is credited (for example in the [[Walter Isaacson]] biography of Jobs) with the solution. Holt employed a [[Switched-mode power supply]] design. This generated far less unwanted heat than a [[linear power supply]], which some other home computers still used.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.righto.com/2012/02/apple-didnt-revolutionize-power.html#ref28&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaacson quotes Wozniak saying that this was not something he could have done: &quot;I only knew vaguely what a switching power supply was.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Isaacson]]: ''[[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]]'', Chapter Six. Simon &amp; Schuster (October 24, 2011) ISBN 1-4516-4855-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
After seeing a crude, [[wire-wrapped]] prototype demonstrated by [[Steve Wozniak]] and [[Steve Jobs]] in November 1976,&lt;ref name=&quot;helmers197803&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1978-03/1978_03_BYTE_03-03_Computer_Music_Systems#page/n19/mode/2up | title=An Apple to Byte | work=BYTE | date=March 1978 | accessdate=October 17, 2013 | author=Helmers, Carl | pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''BYTE'' predicted in April 1977 that the Apple II &quot;may be the first product to fully qualify as the 'appliance computer' ... a completed system which is purchased off the retail shelf, taken home, plugged in and used&quot;. The computer's color graphics capability especially impressed the magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;helmers197704&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1977-04/1977_04_BYTE_02-04_Baudot_Machines#page/n11/mode/2up | title=A Nybble on the Apple | work=BYTE | date=April 1977 | accessdate=October 16, 2013 | author=Helmers, Carl | pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine published a favorable review of the computer in March 1978, concluding that &quot;For the user that wants color graphics, the Apple II is the only practical choice available in the 'appliance' computer class&quot;.{{r|helmers197803}}

''[[Personal Computer World]]'' in August 1978 also cited the color capability as a strength, stating that &quot;the prime reason that anyone buys an Apple II must surely be for the colour graphics&quot;. While mentioning the &quot;oddity&quot; of the artifact colors that produced output &quot;that is not always what one wishes to do&quot;, it noted that &quot;no-one has colour graphics like this at this sort of price&quot;. The magazine praised the sophisticated monitor software, user expandability, and comprehensive documentation, and concluded that &quot;the Apple II is a very promising machine&quot; which &quot;would be even more of a temptation were its price slightly lower ... for the moment, colour is an Apple II&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcw197808&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=https://archive.org/stream/Personal_Computer_World_1978-08_Apple_II_Review#page/n0/mode/2up | title=Colour is an Apple II | work=Personal Computer World | date=August 1978 | accessdate=18 August 2014 | author=Coll, John; Sweeten, Charles | pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;
