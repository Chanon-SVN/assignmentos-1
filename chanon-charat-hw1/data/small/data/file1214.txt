==History==
[[Image:Uhall31.JPG|thumb|right|University Hall at Acadia University]] Acadia began as an extension of Horton Academy (1828), which was founded in [[Horton, Nova Scotia]], by [[Baptists]] from Nova Scotia and Queen's College (1838).&lt;ref name=&quot;Longley, R. S 1938&quot;&gt;Longley, R. S. Acadia University, 1838–1938. Wolfville, N.S.: Acadia University, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; The College was later named Acadia College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acadia University, established at [[Wolfville, Nova Scotia]] in 1838 has a strong [[Baptist]] religious affiliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/tlctd10.txt |title=The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Intellectual Development of the Canadian People |author=John George Bourinot, House of Commons, Ottawa, |date=September 2004 |work= [EBook #6466] |publisher=[[Gutenberg.org]] |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was designed to prepare men for the ministry and to supply education for lay members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0008242 |title=University |author= |date= |work= |publisher= The Canadian Enxyclopedia|accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two major Universities of the day in Nova Scotia were heavily controlled by Denominational structures. King's College ([[University of King's College]]) was an [[Anglican]] School and [[Dalhousie University]], which was originally non-denominational, had placed itself under the control and direction of the [[Church of Scotland]]. It was the failure of Dalhousie to appoint a prominent Baptist pastor and scholar, Edmund Crawley, to the Chair of [[Classics]], as had been expected, that really thrust into the forefront of Baptist thinking the need for a College established and run by the Baptists.

In 1838, the Nova Scotia Baptist Education Society founded Queen's College (named for Queen Victoria). The College began with 21 students in January 1839. The name &quot;Queen's College&quot; was denied to the Baptist school, so it was renamed &quot;Acadia College&quot; in 1841, in reference to the history of the area as an [[Acadian]] settlement. Acadia College awarded its first degrees in 1843 and became Acadia University in 1891,&lt;ref name=&quot;Longley, R. S 1938&quot;/&gt; established by the Acadia University Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/legc/bills/58th_1st/1st_read/b044.htm |title=Acadia University Act (amended) |author= |date= |work=Bill No. 44 |publisher= |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Granville Street Baptist Church (now [[First Baptist Church (Halifax)]]) was an instrumental and determining factor in the founding of the University. It has played a supporting role throughout its history, and shares much of the credit for its survival and development. Many individuals who have made significant contributions to Acadia University, including the first president John Pryor, were members of the First Baptist Church Halifax congregation. Similarly, the adjacent Wolfville United Baptist Church plays a significant role in the life of the university.

The original charter of the college stated:

{{quote|And be it further enacted, that no religious tests or subscriptions shall be required of the Professors Fellows, Scholars, Graduates or Officers of the said College; but that all the privileges and advantages thereof shall be open and free to all and every Person and Persons whomsoever, without regard to religious persuasion&amp;nbsp;... And it shall and may be lawful for the trustees and Governors of the said College to select as Professors, and other Teaches or Officers, competent persons of any religious persuasion whatever, provided such person or persons shall be of moral and religious character.}}

This was unique at the time, and a direct result of Baptists being denied entry into other schools that required religious tests of their students and staff.

In 1851, the power of appointing governors was transferred from the Nova Scotia Baptist Education Society to the Baptist Convention of the Maritime Provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;gutenberg.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/32699/32699-h/32699-h.htm The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Makers of Canada: Index and Dictionary of Canadian History, by Various 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Osborne Wickenden (architect), and J.C. Dumaresq designed the Central Building, Acadia College, 1878–79. 
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1277 Charles Osborne Wickenden (architect)&lt;/ref&gt;

Clara Belle Marshall, from [[Mount Hanley, Nova Scotia]], became the first woman to graduate from Acadia University in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://eapps.ednet.ns.ca/HPIPublic/PropertyDisplay.aspx?Fid=00PNS0193 |title=Mount Hanley School Section Number 10 |author= |date= |work=Nova Scotia Historic Places Initiative Database |publisher= |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, there were changes in the Act of Incorporation.&lt;ref name=&quot;gutenberg.org&quot;/&gt;

The War Memorial House (more generally known as Barrax), which is a residence, and War Memorial Gymnasium &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=1786 War Memorial Gymnasium&lt;/ref&gt;
are landmark buildings on the campus of Acadia University. The Memorial Hall and Gymnasium honours students who had enlisted and died in the [[First World War]], and in the [[Second World War]]. Two granite shafts, which are part of the War Memorial Gymnasium complex at Acadia University, are dedicated to the university's war dead.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=1785 Acadia University memorial granite shafts&lt;/ref&gt; The War Memorial House is dedicated to the war dead from Acadia University during the Second World War &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=1787 Acadia University War memorial house&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew R. Cobb]] designed several campus buildings including: Raynor Hall Residence, 1916; [http://virtualtour.acadiau.ca/horton-hall.html Horton House], designed by Cobb in the Georgian style, and built by  James Reid of [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia]] was opened in 1915 as Horton Academy. Today, Horton Hall is the home of the Department of Psychology and Research and Graduate Studies.  [[File:EmmersonHall.jpg|thumb|Emmerson Hall, Acadia University, was originally built 1913 as Emerson Memorial Library and shows strong Beaux Arts influences. It was erected to honour the memory of the Reverend R. H. Emmerson (1826–1857), father of the former premier of New Brunswick, [[Henry Robert Emmerson|H. R. Emmerson]].]] [[Emmerson Hall]], built in 1913, is particularly interesting for the variety of building stones used. In 1967 Emmerson Hall was converted to classrooms and offices for the School of Education. It is a registered Heritage Property.

In 1966, the Baptist denomination relinquished direct control over the University. The denomination maintains nine seats on the University's Board of Governors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acadiau.ca/board/members.htm |title=Acadia University - Board of Governors |author=Mr. Paul Jewer, Board Chair |date= |work= |publisher=Acadia University |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 January 2008, Dr. Gail Dinter-Gottlieb decided to step down as President and Vice Chancellor of the University before her term expired. Her resignation was effective 29 February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acadiau.ca/whatsnew/newsrelease/2008/gail_gottlieb_steps_down_jan4.html |title=Acadia President to Step Down Ahead of Schedule |author=Scott Roberts |date=4 January 2008 |work= |publisher=Arcadia University |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ray Ivany]] began his position as President and Vice-Chancellor on 1 April 2009.

===Faculty strikes===

Acadia University's Board of Governors and members of the Acadia University Faculty Association (AUFA) have ratified a new [http://www2.acadiau.ca/acadia-news-reader/items/board-and-faculty-sign-new-four-year-contract.html collective agreement news release] covering the period 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2014. The faculty of Acadia University have been on strike twice in the history of the institution. The first was 24 February to 12 March 2004. The second was 15 October to 5 November 2007. The second strike was resolved after the province's labour minister, [[Mark Parent]], appointed a mediator, on 1 November, to facilitate an agreement.

==Academics==

===Profile===
As a primarily undergraduate institution, the university places significant importance on teaching and instruction.

{{quote|The mission of Acadia University is to provide a personalized and rigorous liberal education; promote a robust and respectful scholarly community; and inspire a diversity of students to become critical thinkers, lifelong learners, engaged citizens, and responsible global leaders.}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acadiau.ca/generalInfo/aboutAcadia/mission.html |title=University Mission Statement |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Acadia University |accessdate=30 August 2010}}  -&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rankings===

Acadia University is consistently ranked among the top universities in Canada for undergraduate studies in the Maclean's comprehensive Canadian Universities rankings, coming second in Canada for the 2014 academic year and among the top five for the past decade. This has been attributed to Acadia's small class size and close relationships between the faculty and the students.

===Faculties===
Acadia is organized into four faculties: Arts, Pure &amp; Applied Science, Professional Studies and Theology. Each faculty is further divided into departments and schools specialized in areas of teaching and research. 

==Research==
The Division of Research &amp; Graduate Studies is separate from the faculties and oversees graduate students as well as Acadia's research programs.

Acadia's research programs explore coastal environments, ethno-cultural diversity, social justice, environmental monitoring and climate change, organizational relationships, data mining, the impact of digital technologies, and lifestyle choices contributing to health and wellness. Acadia's research centres include the Tidal Energy Institute, and the Beaubassin Field Station. Applied research opportunities include research with local wineries and grape growers, alternative insect control techniques and technologies. &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title=Acadia University|url=http://www.aucc.ca/canadian-universities/our-universities/acadia-university/}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Innovation==

===The Acadia Advantage===

In 1996, Acadia University pioneered the use of mobile computing technology in a post-secondary educational environment.

This academic initiative, named the Acadia Advantage, integrated the use of notebook computers into the undergraduate curriculum and featured innovations in teaching. By 2000, all full-time, undergraduate Acadia students were taking part in the initiative. The initiative went beyond leasing notebook computers to students during the academic year, and included training, user support and the use of course-specific applications at Acadia that arguably revolutionized learning at the Wolfville, N.S. campus and beyond.

Because of its pioneering efforts, Acadia is a laureate of Washington's Smithsonian Institution and a part of the permanent research collection of the National Museum of American History. It is the only Canadian university selected for inclusion in the Education and Academia category of the Computerworld Smithsonian Award.

In addition, Acadia University received the Pioneer Award for [[Ubiquitous computing|Ubiquitous Computing]]. In 2001, it achieved high rankings in the annual ''[[Maclean's]]'' University Rankings, including Best Overall for Primarily Undergraduate University in their opinion survey, and it received the Canadian Information Productivity Award in 1997 as it was praised as the first university in Canada to fully utilize information technology in the undergraduate curriculum.

In October 2006, Dr. Dinter-Gottlieb established a commission to review the Acadia Advantage learning environment 10 years after inception. The mandate of the commission was to determine how well the current Advantage program meets the needs of students, faculty, and staff and to examine how the role of technology in the postsecondary environment has changed at Acadia, and elsewhere. The commission was asked to recommend changes and enhancements to the Acadia Advantage that would benefit the entire university community and ensure its sustainability.

Some of the recommendations coming from the Acadia Advantage Renewal Report included developing a choice of model specifications and moving from Acadia-issued, student-leased notebook computers to a student-owned computer model. The compelling rationale for this was the integral role technology now plays in our lives, which was not present in 1996.

The University was also advised to unbundle its tuition structure so that the cost of an Acadia education is more detailed and students can understand how their investment in the future of the school is allotted.  In September 2008, Acadia moved to a student-owned notebook computer version of the Acadia Advantage, now named Acadia Advantage 2.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acadiau.ca/advantage |title=Acadia Advantage |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Acadia Advantage |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletics==
Acadia's sports teams are called the [[Acadia Axemen|Axemen]] and [[Acadia Axewomen|Axewomen]]. They participate in the Atlantic University Sports conference of [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]].

School spirit abounds with men's and women's varsity teams that have delivered more conference and national championships than any other institution in Atlantic University Sport. Routinely, more than one-third of Acadia's varsity athletes also achieve Academic All-Canadian designation through Canadian Interuniversity Sport by maintaining a minimum average of 80 per cent.

Expansion and modernization of [[Raymond Field]] was completed in the fall of 2007 and features the installation of an eight-lane all-weather running track and a move to the same premium artificial turf used by the New England Patriots of the [[National Football League]] for its main playing field. The Raymond Field modernization was a gift to the university by friends, alumni, and the province. War Memorial Gymnasium also saw the installation of a new playing floor to benefit its basketball and volleyball teams.

In September 2006, Acadia University announced its partnership with the Wolfville Tritons Swim Club&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tritons.ca |title=Wolfville Tritons Swim Club |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Acadia Masters Swim Club&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.ns.sympatico.ca/masters/ |title=Acadia Masters Swim Clug |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to form the Acadia Swim Club&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://axe.acadiau.ca/swimclub/ |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and return competitive swimming to the university after a 14 year hiatus. On 26 September 2008, the university announced its intention&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acadiau.ca/sports/swim_returns.htm |title=Varsity Swim team returns to Acadia |author= |date=26 September 2008 |work= |publisher=Acadia Sports Information |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to return swimming to a varsity status in September 2009.

==Fight song==
Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as [[Graduation|commencement]], [[convocation]], and athletic games are: ''Stand Up and Cheer'', the Acadia University [[fight song]]. According to 'Songs of Acadia College' (Wolfville, NS 1902-3, 1907), the songs include: 'Acadia Centennial Song' (1938); 'The Acadia Clan Song'; 'Alma Mater - Acadia;' 'Alma Mater Acadia' (1938) and 'Alma Mater Song.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0000759SUBReadings |title=College Songs and Songbooks |author= |date= |work= |publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols==
In 1974, Acadia was granted a coat of arms designed by the [[College of Arms]] in London, England. The coat of arms is two-tone, with the school's official colours, garnet and blue, on the shield. The axes represent the school's origins in a rural setting, and the determination of its founders who cleared the land and built the school on donated items and labour. The open books represent the intellectual pursuits of a university, and the wolves heads are a whimsical representation of the University's location in Wolfville.  &quot;In pulvere vinces&quot; (In dust you conquer) is the motto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.acadiau.ca/archives/research/fta/oct297.html Acadia University's Coat of Arms]&lt;/ref&gt;

The University seal depicts the Greek goddess of wisdom [[Athena]] in front of the first college hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acadiau.ca/chaplain/window.htm#third Description of stained glass windows in Manning Memorial Chapel. The seal is described in the third lancet, fourth panel.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The University also uses a stylized &quot;A&quot; as a logo for its sports teams.

Notable among a number of [[fight song]]s commonly played and sung at various events such as [[Graduation|commencement]], [[convocation]], and athletic games are: the Acadia University [[alma mater]] set to the tune of &quot;[[Annie Lisle]]&quot;. The lyrics are:

:Far above the dykes of Fundy
:And its basin blue
:Stands our noble alma mater
:Glorious to view

:Lift the chorus
:Speed it onward
:Sing it loud and free
:Hail to thee our alma mater
:Acadia, hail to thee

:Far above the busy highway
:And the sleepy town
:Raised against the arch of heaven
:Looks she proudly down&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.acadiau.ca/archives/sporthistory/sound/Alma_Mater_Exerp.mp3 |title=? |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=30 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Historic buildings at Acadia University==
Seminary House, also known as the Ladies' Seminary, is a [[Second Empire architecture|Second Empire]] style-building constructed in 1878 as a home for women attending the university.
