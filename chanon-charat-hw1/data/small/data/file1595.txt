The '''Australian Army''' is Australia's military land force. It is part of the [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF) along with the [[Royal Australian Navy]] and the [[Royal Australian Air Force]]. While the [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]] (CDF) commands the ADF, the Army is commanded by the [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of Army]] (CA). The CA is therefore subordinate to the CDF, but is also directly responsible to the [[Minister of Defence (Australia)|Minister for Defence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/da190356/s9.html| title=Defence Act (1903) – SECT 9 Command of Defence Force and arms of Defence Force| publisher= Australasian Legal Information Institute| accessdate=19 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Australian soldiers have been involved in a number of minor and major conflicts throughout its history, only in [[World War II]] has Australian territory come under direct attack.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Australian Army}}
The history of the Australian Army can be divided into two periods:
* 1901–1947, when limits were set on the size of the regular Army, the vast majority of peacetime soldiers were in reserve units of the [[Citizens Military Force]] (also known as the CMF or Militia), and [[Australian Imperial Force (disambiguation)|Australian Imperial Force]]s were formed to serve overseas,{{sfn|Grey|2008|pp=88 &amp; 147}}{{sfn|Odgers|1988|p=5}}  and
* Post-1947, when a standing peacetime regular [[infantry]] force was formed and the CMF (known as the Army Reserve after 1980) began to decline in importance.{{sfn|Grey|2008|pp=200–201}}{{sfn|Odgers|1988|p=5}}

[[File:Cavalry scout Iraq.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Australian Cavalry Scout in Iraq, 2007]]

During its history the Australian Army has fought in a number of major wars, including: [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902), [[First World War]] (1914–1918), the [[Second World War]] (1939–1945), [[Korea War]] (1950–1953), [[Malayan Emergency]] (1950–1960), [[Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation]] (1962–1966), [[Vietnam War]] (1962–1973),{{sfn|Odgers|1988|p=}} and more recently in [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] (2001 – present) and [[Iraq]] (2003–2009).{{sfn|Grey|2008|pp=284–285}} Since 1947 the Australian Army has also been involved in many peacekeeping operations, usually under the auspices of the United Nations, however the non United Nations sponsored [[Multinational Force and Observers]] in the Sinai is a notable exception. Australia's largest peacekeeping deployment began in 1999 in [[International Force for East Timor|East Timor]], while other ongoing operations include peacekeeping on [[Bougainville Province|Bougainville]], in the [[Multinational Force and Observers|Sinai]], and in the [[Solomon Islands]]. Humanitarian relief after [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] in [[Aceh]] Province, [[Indonesia]], [[Operation Sumatra Assist]], ended on 24 March 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/peacekeeping/ |title=Australian War Memorial Official History of Peacekeeping, Humanitarian and Post-Cold War Operations |accessdate=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Australia Land Forces 2012.png|thumb|center|620px|&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;The Australian Army's structure in 2012&lt;/div&gt;]]

The [[1st Division (Australia)|1st Division]] comprises a deployable headquarters, while [[2nd Division (Australia)|2nd Division]] under the command of [[Forces Command (Australia)|Forces Command]] is the main home-defence formation, containing Army Reserve units. 2nd Division's headquarters only performs administrative functions. The Australian Army has not deployed a divisional-sized formation since 1945 and does not expect to do so in the future.{{sfn|Horner|2001|p=195}}

===1st Division===
'''[[1st Division (Australia)|1st Division]]''' carries out high-level training activities and deploys to command large-scale ground operations. It does not have any combat units permanently assigned.
[[File:Machine gun team from 1 RAR during RIMPAC 2012.JPG|thumb|[[1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment|1 RAR]] machine-gun team training in [[Hawaii]] during RIMPAC 2012]]

===Forces Command===
[[Forces Command (Australia)|Forces Command]] controls for administrative purposes all non-[[special forces|special-forces]] assets of the Australian Army. It is neither an operational nor a deployable command.
* '''[[1st Brigade (Australia)|1 Brigade]]''' – Mechanised brigade based in Darwin.
* '''[[3rd Brigade (Australia)|3 Brigade]]''' – Light-infantry brigade based in Townsville.
* '''[[6th Brigade (Australia)|6 Brigade (CS&amp;ISTAR)]]''' – Mixed brigade based in Sydney.
* '''[[7th Brigade (Australia)|7 Brigade]]''' – Motorised brigade based in Brisbane.
* '''[[16th Aviation Brigade (Australia)|16 Aviation Brigade]]''' – Army Aviation brigade based in [[Enoggera Barracks|Enoggera]].
* '''[[17th Combat Service Support Brigade (Australia)|17 Combat Service Support Brigade]]''' – Logistic brigade based in Sydney.
* '''[[2nd Division (Australia)|2nd Division]]''' administers the reserve forces from its headquarters located in Sydney
** '''[[4th Brigade (Australia)|4 Brigade]]''' – based in Victoria.
** '''[[5th Brigade (Australia)|5 Brigade]]''' – based in New South Wales.
** '''[[8th Brigade (Australia)|8 Brigade]]''' – based in New South Wales.
** '''[[9th Brigade (Australia)|9 Brigade]]''' – based in South Australia and Tasmania.
** '''[[11th Brigade (Australia)|11 Brigade]]''' – based in Queensland.
** '''[[13th Brigade (Australia)|13 Brigade]]''' – based in Western Australia.

Additionally, Forces Command includes the following training establishments:
* [[Army Recruit Training Centre]] at Kapooka; 
* [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]]; 
* [[Combined Arms Training Centre (Australia)|Combined Arms Training Centre]] at Puckapunyal; 
* [[Army Logistic Training Centre (Australia)|Army Logistic Training Centre]] at Bonegilla and Bandiana; and 
* [[Oakey Army Aviation Centre|Army Aviation Training Centre]] at Oakey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.army.gov.au/Who-we-are/Divisions-and-Brigades/Forces-Command |title=Forces Command |publisher=Australian Army |accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Australian SOTG patrol Oct 2009.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Australian special forces in Afghanistan, 2009]]

===Special Forces===
[[Special Operations Command (Australia)|Special Operations Command]] comprises a command formation of equal status to the other commands in the ADF. It is a brigade-sized formation responsible for all of Australia's [[special forces|special-forces]] assets.

===Planned restructuring===
Under a restructuring program known as [[Plan Beersheba]] announced in late 2011, the 1st, 3rd and 7th Brigades will be re-formed as combined-arms multi-role manoeuvre brigades with the [[2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]] (part of the 3rd Brigade) forming the core of a future amphibious force&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The force will be known as an Amphibious Ready Element and will utilise the former Royal Navy 16,000-tonne auxiliary Bay class landing ship [[HMAS Choules (L100)|RFA Largs Bay (L3006)]], bought for $100 million to become HMAS Choules.&lt;ref&gt;

==Colours, standards and guidons==
{{Main|Colours, standards and guidons}}
[[File:AustArmyColours.jpg|thumb|left|300px|All colours of the Army were on parade for the centenary of the Army, 10 March 2001.]]
[[File:Australian and Afghan soldiers wait for US Black Hawks.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Australian soldiers wearing the [[Disruptive Pattern Combat Uniform]] alongside Afghan National Army soldiers in Afghanistan]]
Infantry, and some other combat units of the Australian Army carry flags called the Queen's Colour and the Regimental Colour, known as &quot;the Colours&quot;.{{sfn|Jobson|2009|p=53}} Armoured units carry Standards and Guidons – flags smaller than Colours and traditionally carried by Cavalry, Lancer, Light Horse and Mounted Infantry units. The 1st Armoured Regiment is the only unit in the Australian Army to carry a Standard, in the tradition of heavy armoured units. Artillery units' guns are considered to be their Colours, and on parade are provided with the same respect.{{sfn|Jobson|2009|pp=55–56}} Non-combat units (combat service support corps) do not have Colours, as Colours are battle flags and so are only available to combat units. As a substitute, many have Standards or Banners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Flags, Military Flags, &amp; Queens and Regimental Colours |publisher=Digger History |url=http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-flags/0-flag-cat-index.htm |accessdate=3 April 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070405154849/http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-flags/0-flag-cat-index.htm| archivedate= 5 April 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Units awarded [[battle honours]] have them emblazoned on their Colours, Standards and Guidons. They are a link to the unit's past and a memorial to the fallen. Artillery do not have Battle Honours – their single Honour is &quot;Ubique&quot; which means &quot;Everywhere&quot; – although they can received Honour Titles.{{sfn|Jobson|2009|p=58}}

The Army is the guardian of the [[Flag of Australia|National Flag]] and as such, unlike the [[Royal Australian Air Force]], does not have a flag or Colours. The Army, instead, has a banner, known as the Army Banner. To commemorate the centenary of the Army, the Governor General [[Sir William Deane]], presented the Army with a new Banner at a parade in front of the [[Australian War Memorial]] on 10 March 2001. The Banner was presented to the [[Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army (Australia)|Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army (RSM-A)]], Warrant Officer Peter Rosemond.

The Army Banner bears the [[Coat of arms of Australia|Australian Coat of Arms]] on the obverse, with the dates &quot;1901–2001&quot; in gold in the upper hoist. The reverse bears the [[Rising Sun (badge)|&quot;rising sun&quot; badge]] of the Australian Army, flanked by seven [[Battle honours|campaign honours]] on small gold-edged scrolls: [[Second Boer War|South Africa]], [[World War I]], [[World War II]], [[Korean War|Korea]], [[Malayan Emergency|Malaya-Borneo]], [[Vietnam War|South Vietnam]], and Peacekeeping. The banner is trimmed with gold fringe, has gold and crimson cords and tassels, and is mounted on a pike with the usual British royal crest finial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Army Flags (Australia) |publisher=Flags of the World |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/au%5Earmy.html |accessdate=3 April 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070403011109/http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/au%5Earmy.html| archivedate= 3 April 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personnel==

===Strength===
In the 2010–11 financial year the Army had an average strength of 47,135 personnel: 30,235 permanent (regular) and 16,900 active reservists (part-time).&lt;ref name=DefPBS&gt;{{Cite book|title=Portfolio Budget Statements 2011–12: Defence Portfolio|year=2011|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|isbn=978-0-642-29739-6|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/budget/11-12/pbs/2011-2012_Defence_PBS_Complete.pdf|author=Department of Defence|location=Canberra|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition there are another 12,496 members of the Standby Reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Australian National Audit Office |title=Army Reserve Forces |publisher=Australian National Audit Office |location=Canberra |year=2009 |series=Audit Report No.31 2008–09 |isbn=0-642-81063-X |url=http://www.anao.gov.au/uploads/documents/2008-09_Audit_Report_No.31.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regular Army is targeted to expand to 31,000 personnel by 2014–15.&lt;ref name=DefPBS/&gt;

===Rank and insignia===
{{Main|Australian Army officer rank insignia|Australian Army enlisted rank insignia}}
The ranks of the Australian Army are based on the ranks of the [[British Army]], and carry mostly the same actual [[Australian Army officer rank insignia|insignia]]. For [[officer (armed forces)|officer]]s the ranks are identical except for the shoulder title &quot;Australia&quot;. The [[Non-Commissioned Officer]] [[Australian Army enlisted rank insignia|insignia]] are the same up until [[Warrant Officer]] ranks, where they are stylised for Australia (for example, using the Australian, rather than the British coat of arms).
The ranks of the Australian Army are as follows:
# Private (PTE) – OR-1
# Private Proficient (PTE(P)) Also used within the Private equivalent ranks – OR-2
# Lance Corporal or Lance Bombardier (LCPL or LBDR) – OR-3
# Corporal or Bombardier (CPL or BDR) – OR-4
# Sergeant (SGT) – OR-5
# Staff Sergeant (SSGT) – OR-6 (SSGT is being phased out of the Australian Army)
# Warrant Officer Class Two (WO2) – OR-7
# Warrant Officer Class One (WO1) – OR-9
# Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army (RSM-A) – OR-9 (This is an appointment rather than a rank)
# Second Lieutenant (2LT) – OF-1
# Lieutenant (LT) – OF-1
# Captain (CAPT) – OF-2
# Major (MAJ) – OF-3
# Lieutenant Colonel (LTCOL) – OF-4
# Colonel (COL) – OF-5
# Brigadier (BRIG) – OF-6. Like the United Kingdom, prior to 1922 Australia used the rank Brigadier General
# Major General (MAJGEN) – OF-7
# Lieutenant General (LTGEN) – OF-8
# General (GEN) – OF-9
# Field Marshal (FM) – OF-10. This rank is generally reserved for wartime and ceremonial purposes; there are no regular appointments to the rank. Sir [[Thomas Blamey]] is the only Australian-born officer promoted to the rank. [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], is currently the only living holder of the rank of Field Marshal in the Australian Army. The Duke, however, does not have any active role in the Australian command structure.
