'''Alexandra''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc-gre|·ºàŒªŒµŒæŒ¨ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒ±}}) is the feminine form of the given name [[Alexander]], which is a [[romanization]] of the [[Greek language|Greek]] name {{lang|grc-gre|·ºàŒªŒ≠ŒæŒ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøœÇ}} (''Alexandros''). [[Etymology|Etymologically]], the name is a compound of the Greek verb {{lang|grc|·ºÄŒªŒ≠ŒæŒµŒπŒΩ}} (''alexein'') &quot;to defend&quot; and {{lang|grc|·ºÄŒΩŒÆœÅ}} (''anƒìr'') &quot;man&quot; (&lt;small&gt;[[genitive|GEN]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|grc|·ºÄŒΩŒ¥œÅœåœÇ}} ''andros''). Thus it may be roughly translated as &quot;defender of man&quot; or &quot;protector of man&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)le/candros|·ºàŒªŒ≠ŒæŒ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøœÇ|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)le/cw|·ºÄŒªŒ≠ŒæŒµŒπŒΩ|shortref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)nh/r|·ºÄŒΩŒÆœÅ|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The name was one of the titles or [[epithet]]s given to the Greek goddess [[Hera]] and as such is usually taken to mean &quot;one who comes to save warriors&quot;. The earliest attested form of the name is the [[Mycenaean Greek]] {{lang|gmy|êÄÄêÄ©êÄèêÄ≠êÄÖêÄ®}}, ''a-re-ka-sa-da-ra'', written in the [[Linear B]] syllabic script.&lt;ref&gt;Tablet [[Mycenae|MY]] V 659 (61). {{cite web|url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/default.aspx?static=12&amp;wid=217|title=The Linear B word a-re-ka-sa-da-ra|website=Palaeolexicon.
