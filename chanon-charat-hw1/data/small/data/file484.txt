An '''artist''' is a person engaged in one or more of any of a broad spectrum of activities related to creating [[art]], practicing the [[arts]], and/or demonstrating an art.  The common usage in both everyday [[speech]] and academic [[discourse]] is a practitioner in the [[visual art]]s only.  The term is often used in the [[entertainment]] business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (less often for [[actor]]s).  &quot;Artiste&quot; (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context.  Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is certainly valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like [[criticism]]. 

==Dictionary definitions==
Wiktionary defines the noun 'artist' (Singular: artist; Plural: artists) as follows: 
# A person who creates art.
# A person who creates art as an [[wikt:occupation|occupation]].
# A person who is skilled at some activity.
The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines the older broad meanings of the term &quot;artist&quot;:

* A learned person or Master of Arts
* One who pursues a practical science, traditionally [[medicine]], [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], [[chemistry]]
* A follower of a pursuit in which skill comes by study or practice
* A follower of a manual art, such as a mechanic
* One who makes their [[craft]] a fine art
* One who cultivates one of the [[fine arts]] – traditionally the arts presided over by the [[muses]]

==History of the term==
Although the Greek word &quot;techně&quot; is often mistranslated as &quot;art,&quot; it actually implies mastery of any sort of craft. The adjectival Latin form of the word, &quot;technicus&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;
[[Oxford English Dictionary]] s.v. ''technic''
&lt;/ref&gt;
became the source of the English words [[wikt:technique|technique]], [[technology]], [[wikt:technical|technical]].

In Greek culture each of the nine [[Muse]]s oversaw a different field of human creation:
* [[Calliope]] (the 'beautiful of speech'): chief of the muses and muse of [[epic poetry|epic or heroic poetry]]
* [[Clio]] (the 'glorious one'): muse of [[history]]
* [[Erato]] (the 'amorous one'): muse of [[love poetry|love or erotic poetry]], lyrics, and marriage songs
* [[Euterpe]] (the 'well-pleasing'): muse of music and [[lyric poetry]]
* [[Melpomene]] (the 'chanting one'): muse of [[tragedy]]
* [[Polyhymnia]] or Polymnia (the '[singer] of many [[hymn]]s'): muse of [[sacred|sacred song]], [[Public speaking|oratory]], [[Lyrics|lyric]], [[singing]], and [[rhetoric]]
* [[Terpsichore]] (the '[one who] delights in dance'): muse of [[choral]] song and dance
* [[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]] (the 'blossoming one'): muse of [[comedy]] and [[bucolic poetry]]
* [[Urania]] (the 'celestial one'): muse of [[astronomy]]

No muse was identified with the visual arts of painting and sculpture. In ancient Greece sculptors and painters were held in low regard, somewhere between freemen and slaves, their work regarded as mere manual labour.&lt;ref&gt;
''In Our Time: The Artist'' [[BBC Radio 4]], TX 28th March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''art'' derives from the Latin &quot;ars&quot; (stem ''art-''), which, although literally defined, means &quot;[[skill]] method&quot; or &quot;technique&quot;, and conveys a connotation of [[beauty]].

During the Middle Ages the word ''artist'' already existed in some countries such as [[Italy]], but the meaning was something resembling ''craftsman'', while the word ''artesan'' was still unknown. An artist was someone able to do a work better than others, so the skilled excellency was underlined, rather than the activity field. In this period some &quot;artisanal&quot; products (such as textiles) were much more precious and expensive than paintings or sculptures.

The first division into major and minor arts dates back at least to the works of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404-1472): ''[[De re aedificatoria]], De statua, De pictura'', which focused on the importance of the intellectual skills of the artist rather than the manual skills (even if in other forms of art there was a [[project]] behind).&lt;ref&gt;
P.Galloni, ''Il sacro artefice. Mitologie degli artigiani medievali'', Laterza, [[Bari]], 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Academy|Academies]] in Europe (second half of 16th century) the gap between fine and applied arts was definitely set.

Many contemporary definitions of &quot;artist&quot; and &quot;art&quot; are highly contingent on [[culture]], resisting aesthetic prescription, in much the same way that the features constituting beauty and the beautiful cannot be standardized easily without corruption into [[kitsch]].

==The present day concept of an 'artist'==
''Artist'' is a descriptive term applied to a person who engages in an activity deemed to be an art. An artist also may be defined unofficially as &quot;a person who expresses him- or herself through a medium&quot;. The word is also used in a qualitative sense of, a person [[creativity|creative]] in, [[innovation|innovative]] in, or adept at, an artistic practice.

Most often, the term describes those who create within a context of the fine arts or '[[high culture]]', activities such as [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[acting]], [[dancing]], [[writing]], [[filmmaking]], [[New media art|new media]], [[photography]], and [[music]]—people who use imagination, talent, or skill to create works that may be judged to have an [[aesthetic]] value. [[Art history|Art historians]] and [[Art critic|critics]] define artists as those who produce art within a recognized or recognizable discipline.  Contrasting terms for highly skilled workers in media in the [[applied arts]] or [[decorative arts]] include [[artisan]], [[Master craftsman|craftsman]], and specialized terms such as [[pottery|potter]], [[goldsmith]] or [[glassblower]].  Fine arts artists such as painters succeeded in the [[Renaissance]] in raising their status, formerly similar to these workers, to a decisively higher level, but in the 20th century the distinction became rather less relevant {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.

The term may also be used loosely or metaphorically to denote highly skilled people in any non-&quot;art&quot; activities, as well— law, medicine, mechanics, or mathematics, for example.

Often, discussions on the subject focus on the differences among &quot;artist&quot; and &quot;[[technician]]&quot;, &quot;[[entertainer]]&quot; and &quot;[[artisan]]&quot;, &quot;[[fine arts|fine art]]&quot; and &quot;[[applied art]]&quot;, or what constitutes art and what does not. The [[French language|French]] word ''artiste'' (which in French, simply means &quot;artist&quot;) has been imported into the [[English language]] where it means a performer (frequently in [[Music Hall]] or [[Vaudeville]]). Use of the word &quot;artiste&quot; can also be a [[pejorative]] term.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth G. Wilson. [http://books.google.com/books?id=L2ChiO2yEZ0C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=artist++uncomplimentary+%22artiste%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=hxsr0c9Db2&amp;sig=e66MaUj3vzQQJmsA2N9zdp3GMFo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ct=result The Columbia guide to standard American English].&lt;/ref&gt;

The English word 'artiste' has thus a narrower range of meaning than the word 'artiste' in French.

In ''Living with Art'',{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Mark Getlein proposes six activities, services or functions of contemporary artists:
#Create places for some human purpose.
#Create extraordinary versions of ordinary objects.
#Record and commemorate.
#Give tangible form to the unknown.
#Give tangible form to feelings.
#Refresh our vision and help see the world in new ways.

After looking at years of data on arts school graduates as well as policies &amp; program outcomes regarding artists, arts, &amp; culture, Elizabeth Lingo and Steven Tepper propose the divide between &quot;arts for art's sake&quot; artists and commercially successful artists is not as wide as may be perceived, and that &quot;this bifurcation between the commercial and the noncommercial, the excellent and the base, the elite and the popular, is increasingly breaking down (Eikhof &amp; Haunschild, 2007). Lingo and Tepper point out:&lt;ref&gt;Lingo, Elizabeth L. and Tepper, Steven J (2013), 'Looking Back, Looking Forward: Arts-Based Careers and Creative Work,' in Work and Occupations 40(4) 337-363.&lt;/ref&gt;
#arts ''consumers'' don't restrict themselves to either &quot;high&quot; or &quot;common&quot; arts; instead, they demonstrate &quot;omnivorous tastes, liking both reggae and Rachmaninoff&quot; (Peterson &amp; Kern, 1996; Walker &amp; Scott-Melnyk, 2002)
#data indicates &quot;artists are willing to move across sectors and no longer see working outside the commercial sector as a badge of distinction or authenticity&quot; (Bridgstock, 2013; Ellmeier, 2003)
#academic, policy, and government leaders are adapting--widening--programs &amp; opportunities in recognition of &quot;the role of artists as drivers of economic growth and innovation&quot; (Bohm &amp; Land, 2009; DCMS, 2006, 2008; Florida, 2012; Hesmondhalgh &amp; Baker, 2010; Lloyd, 2010; Iyengar, 2013).
#arts graduates name &quot;business and management skills&quot; as the &quot;number one area [they] wish they had been more exposed to in college&quot; (Strategic National Arts Alumni Project [SNAAP], 2011; Tepper &amp; Kuh, 2010).

Please resist the temptation to add your favorite artist or artform to this list. It is intended to illustrate the breadth of the concept, not to list every possible artform and movement. It should contain only the most significant directions and mention one artist who may be considered iconic in this domain. For all practical purposes it appears to be complete.
