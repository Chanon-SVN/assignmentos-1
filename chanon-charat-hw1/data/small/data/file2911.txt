The '''House of Bonaparte''' was an imperial and royal European [[dynasty]] founded by [[Napoleon I]] in 1804, a French military leader who rose to notability out of the [[French Revolution]] and transformed the [[First French Republic|French Republic]] into the [[First French Empire]] in 1804 within five years of [[Coup of 18 Brumaire | his ''coup d'état'']] of November 1799. Napoleon turned the ''[[Grande Armée]]'' against every major European power and dominated continental Europe through a series of military victories during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. He installed members of his family on the thrones of client states, founding the dynasty.

The House of Bonaparte formed the [[Imperial House of France (First French Empire)|Imperial House of France]] during the French Empire together with some non-Bonaparte family members. In addition to holding the title of [[Emperor of the French]], the Bonaparte dynasty held various other titles and territories during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], including their ancestral [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]], the [[Kingdom of Spain]], the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], the [[Kingdom of Holland]] and the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. The dynasty held power for around a decade until the Napoleonic Wars began to take their toll. Making very powerful enemies such as [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], as well as royalist (particularly [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]]) restorational movements in France, Spain, the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Two Sicilies]] and [[Kingdom of Sardinia|Sardinia]], the dynasty eventually collapsed under its own{{cn|date=November 2014}} weight.

During the reign of Napoleon I, the Imperial Family consisted of the Emperor's immediate relations – his wife, son, siblings and some other close relatives, namely [[Joachim Murat]], [[Joseph Fesch]] and [[Eugène de Beauharnais]].

Between the years 1852 and 1870 there was a [[Second French Empire]], again a member of the Bonaparte dynasty would rule France: [[Napoleon III]] the son of [[Louis Bonaparte]]. However during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870-1871 the dynasty was again ousted from the Imperial Throne. Since that time there has been a series of pretenders. Supporters of the Bonaparte family's claim to the [[throne of France]] are known as [[Bonapartists]]. Current head [[Jean-Christophe, Prince Napoléon]] has a Bourbon mother.

==Italian origins==
The Bonaparte (originally ''Buonaparte'') family were from minor [[Italian nobility]] who held most of their property in the hill town of [[San Miniato]] near [[Florence, Italy]]. The name derives from Italian, ''buona'', &quot;good&quot; and ''parte'', &quot;part&quot; or &quot;side&quot;.

After settling in Florence the family enjoyed a relationship with the then ruling [[Medici]] family. [[Jacopo Buonaparte]] was a friend and advisor to [[Medici]] [[Pope Clement VII]]. Jacopo was also a witness to and wrote an account of the [[sack of Rome (1527)|sack of Rome]], which is one of the most important historical documents recounting that event.&lt;ref&gt;Jacopo Bonaparte: ''Sac de Rome''. Écrit EN 1527 par Jacques Bonaparte. Témoin oculaire, hrsgg. by Bonaparte, Napoléon Louis, Florenz 1850&lt;/ref&gt; Two of Jacopo's nephews, Pier Antonio Buonaparte and Giovanni Buonaparte, however, took part in the 1527 Medici rebellion, after which they were banished from Florence and later were restored by [[Alessandro de' Medici, Duke of Florence]]. Jacopo's brother Benedetto Buonaparte maintained political neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joshua F. Drake]], ''The Part-books of a Florentine Ex-Patriate: new light on Florence, Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale Ms. Magl. XIX 164–7'', [[Early Music]] (OUP), Vol. 33, no. 4 (Oct. 2005), pp. 639–646. [http://em.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/33/4/639]&lt;/ref&gt;

The family later separated into two branches; One stayed in San Miniato, and the other moved to Sarzana. Buonaparte-Sarzana, ''Nobili di [[Sarzana]]'' had been compelled to leave Florence due to the defeat of the [[Ghibellines]]. A member of the Sarzana branch and ancestor to Napoleon, [[Francesco Buonaparte]] came to Corsica in 16th century and the island was in [[Genoa|Genoese]] possession.

The Buonaparte tomb lies in the Church of San Francesco in San Miniato.

The last member of the Italian branches was a canon named Gregorio Bonaparte, who died in 1803 leaving Napoleon as heir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Sir Bernard|title=Vicissitudes of Families|year=1869|publisher=Longmans, Green, Reader, and Dye|location=Great Britain|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HSYwAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Napoleon]] is the most prominent name associated with the Bonaparte family because he conquered much of the Western world during the early part of the 19th century. He was elected as First Consul of France on 10 November 1799 with the help of his brother, [[Lucien Bonaparte]], and president of the [[Council of Five Hundred]] at [[Saint-Cloud]]. He was crowned Emperor of the French and ruled from 1804–1814, 1815.

Following his conquest of most of Western Europe, Napoleon I made his elder brother [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]] (1768–1844) king first of [[Naples]] (1806–1808) and then of Spain (1808–1813), his third brother [[Louis Bonaparte|Louis]] (1778–1846) King of Holland (1806–1810) (subsequently forcing his abdication after his failure to subordinate Dutch interests to those of France) and his youngest brother [[Jérôme Bonaparte]] (1784–1860) King of [[Kingdom of Westphalia|Westphalia]], the short-lived realm created from some of the states of northwestern Germany (1807–1813).

Napoleon's son [[Napoleon II|Napoléon François Charles Joseph]] (1811–1832) was created King of Rome (1811–1814) and was later styled Napoléon II by loyalists of the dynasty, though he only ruled for two weeks after his father's abdication. Louis-Napoléon (1808–1873), son of Louis, was President of France in 1848–1852 and Emperor in 1852–1870, reigning as [[Napoleon III]]; his son, [[Napoléon, Prince Imperial]] (1856–1879) died fighting the [[Zulu people|Zulu]]s in [[KwaZulu-Natal Province|Natal]], South Africa. With his death, the family lost much of its remaining political appeal, though claimants continue to assert their right to the imperial title. A political movement for Corsican independence surfaced in the 1990s which included a Bonapartist restoration in its programme.

==Bonaparte arms==
The arms of the Bonaparte family were: ''Gules two bends sinister between two mullets or''. In 1804 Napoleon I changed the arms to ''Azure an imperial eagle or''. The change applied to all members of his family except for his brother Lucien and his nephew, the son from Jerome's first marriage.

==2011 DNA research==
According to a study in 2011, [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]], and therefore all the Bonaparte (males only), belonged to haplogroup [[Haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)#E1b1b1c .28E-M123.29|E1b1b1c1* (E-M34*)]]. This haplogroup, rare in Europe, has its highest concentration in [[Ethiopia]] and in the [[Near East]] (Jordan, Yemen). According to the authors of the study, &quot;Probably Napoléon also knew his remote oriental patrilineal origins, because Francesco Buonaparte (the Giovanni son), who was a mercenary under the orders of the Genoa Republic in Ajaccio in 1490, was nicknamed ''The [[Moors|Maure]] of [[Sarzana|Sarzane]]'' &quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jmbr/article/view/10609 Haplogroup of the Y Chromosome of Napoléon the First], Lucotte 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Living members==
{{unsourced section|date=January 2014}}
The headship of the family is in dispute between [[Charles, Prince Napoléon]], born 1950, great-great-grandson of [[Jérôme Bonaparte]] by his second marriage; and his son [[Jean-Christophe, Prince Napoléon]] (born 1986) who was appointed heir in the will of his grandfather [[Louis, Prince Napoléon]]. The only other male member of the family is Charles' recently married brother, [[Prince Jérôme Napoléon]] (born 1957). There are no remaining descendants in the male line from any other of Napoleon's brothers. There are, however, numerous descendants of Napoleon's illegitimate, but recognized son [[Walewski]] from his union with [[Marie, Countess Walewski]]. Of these include the Wattier family and its union with the Bonaparte family. The later descendants were the Peschongs and Herrs. A descendant of Napoleon's sister Caroline Bonaparte is actor [[René Auberjonois (actor)|René Auberjonois]].
