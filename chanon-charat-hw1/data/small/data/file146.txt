All the discovered alkali metals occur in nature: in order of [[abundance of the chemical elements|abundance]], sodium is the most abundant, followed by potassium, lithium, rubidium, caesium, and finally francium, which is very rare due to its extremely high [[radioactivity]] and thus occurs only in [[trace radioisotope|traces]] due to its presence in natural [[decay chain]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;webelements-occurrence&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chemeducator&quot;/&gt; Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of [[ununennium]] (Uue), which is likely to be the next member of the group, but they have all met with failure.&lt;ref name=&quot;link&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Search for superheavy elements using &lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;Ca + &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Es&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt; reaction|first1=R.W. |last1=Lougheed |first2=J.H.|last2=Landrum|first3=E.K.|last3=Hulet|first4=J.F.|last4=Wild|first5=R.J.|last5=Dougan|first6=A.D.|last6=Dougan|first7=H.|last7=Gäggeler|first8=M|last8=Schädel|first9=K.J.|last9=Moody|first10=K.E.|last10=Gregorich|last11=Seaborg|journal=Physical Review C|year=1985|pages=1760–1763|volume=32|issue=5|bibcode = 1985PhRvC..32.1760L|doi=10.1103/PhysRevC.32.1760|first11=G. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of [[superheavy element]]s;&lt;ref name=&quot;tanm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lch.web.psi.ch/files/lectures/TexasA&amp;M/TexasA&amp;M.pdf |title=Gas Phase Chemistry of Superheavy Elements |author=Gäggeler, Heinz W. |date=5–7 November 2007 |work=Lecture Course Texas A&amp;M |accessdate=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal, it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1729–1733}}

Most alkali metals have many different applications. Two of the most well-known applications of the pure elements are rubidium and caesium [[atomic clock]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;atomic-clocks&quot;/&gt; of which caesium atomic clocks are the most accurate and precise representation of time.&lt;ref name=&quot;pubs.usgs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nist-second&quot;/&gt; A common application of the compounds of sodium is the [[sodium-vapour lamp]], which emits very efficient light.&lt;ref name=&quot;lamp1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lamp2&quot;/&gt; [[Salt|Table salt]], or sodium chloride, has been used since antiquity. Sodium and potassium are also [[essential element]]s, having major biological roles as [[electrolyte]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;webelements-potassium&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;webelements-sodium&quot;/&gt; and although the other alkali metals are not essential, they also have various effects on the body, both beneficial and harmful.&lt;ref name=&quot;webelements-lithium&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;webelements-rubidium&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;webelements-caesium&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc-francium&quot;/&gt;

===Physical and chemical===
The physical and chemical properties of the alkali metals can be readily explained by their having an ns&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; valence [[electron configuration]], which results in weak [[metallic bonding]]. Hence, all the alkali metals are soft and have low [[density|densities]],&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt; [[melting point|melting]]&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt; and [[boiling point]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt; as well as [[heat of sublimation|heats of sublimation]], [[heat of vaporization|vaporisation]], and [[heat of dissociation|dissociation]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot;/&gt;{{rp|74}} They all crystallize in the [[body-centered cubic]] crystal structure,&lt;ref name=Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw/&gt;{{rp|73}} and have distinctive [[flame test|flame colours]] because their outer s electron is very easily excited.&lt;ref name=Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw/&gt;{{rp|75}} The ns&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; configuration also results in the alkali metals having very large [[atomic radius|atomic]] and [[ionic radius|ionic radii]], as well as high [[thermal conductivity|thermal]] and [[electrical conductivity]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw/&gt;{{rp|75}} Their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their lone valence electron to form the +1 oxidation state, due to the ease of ionizing this electron and the very high second ionization energy.&lt;ref name=Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw/&gt;{{rp|76}} Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group. The chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme [[radioactive decay|radioactivity]];&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot; /&gt; thus, the presentation of its properties here is limited.

In aqueous solution, the alkali metal ions form [[metal ions in aqueous solution|aqua ions]] of the formula [M(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n'' is the solvation number. Their [[coordination number]]s and shapes agree well with those expected from their ionic radii. In aqueous solution the water molecules directly attached to the metal ion are said to belong to the [[first coordination sphere]], also known as the first, or primary, solvation shell. The bond between a water molecule and the metal ion is a [[dative covalent bond]], with the oxygen atom donating both electrons to the bond. Each coordinated water molecule may be attached by [[hydrogen bond]]s to other water molecules. The latter are said to reside in the second coordination sphere. However, for the alkali metal cations, the second coordination sphere is not well-defined as the +1 charge on the cation is not high enough to [[polarization|polarize]] the water molecules in the primary solvation shell enough for them to form strong hydrogen bonds with those in the second coordination sphere, producing a more stable entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burgess |first=John |title=Metal Ions in Solution |year=1978 |publisher=Ellis Horwood |location=Chichester |page=20 |isbn=0-85312-027-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Richens/&gt;{{rp|25}} The solvation number for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; has been experimentally determined to be 4, forming the [[tetrahedron|tetrahedral]] [Li(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;: while solvation numbers of 3 to 6 have been found for lithium aqua ions, solvation numbers less than 4 may be the result of the formation of contact [[ion-pair]]s, and the higher solvation numbers may be interpreted in terms of water molecules that approach [Li(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; through a face of the tetrahedron, though molecular dynamic simulations may indicate the existence of an [[octahedron|octahedral]] hexaaqua ion.

====Lithium====
The chemistry of lithium shows several differences from that of the rest of the group as the small Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation [[chemical polarity|polarises]] [[anion]]s and gives its compounds a more [[covalent bond|covalent]] character.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot; /&gt; Lithium and [[magnesium]] have a [[diagonal relationship]] due to their similar atomic radii,&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot; /&gt; so that they show some similarities. For example, lithium forms a stable [[nitride]], a property common among all the [[alkaline earth metal]]s (magnesium's group) but unique among the alkali metals.&lt;ref name=&quot;alkalireact&quot;/&gt; In addition, among their respective groups, only lithium and magnesium form [[covalent bond|covalent]] [[organometallic compound]]s (e.g. Li[[methyl group|Me]] and MgMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Shriver&amp;Atkins&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Inorganic Chemistry |first1=Duward |last1=Shriver |first2=Peter |last2=Atkins |publisher=W.

Lithium fluoride is the only alkali metal halide that is not soluble in water,&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt; and [[lithium hydroxide]] is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not [[deliquescent]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt; Conversely, [[lithium perchlorate]] and other lithium salts with large anions that cannot be polarized are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals, probably because Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; has a high [[solvation energy]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw/&gt;{{rp|76}} This effect also means that most simple lithium salts are commonly encountered in hydrated form, because the anhydrous forms are extremely [[hygroscopic]]: this allows salts like [[lithium chloride]] and [[lithium bromide]] to be used in [[dehumidifier]]s and [[air-conditioner]]s.&lt;ref name=Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw/&gt;{{rp|76}}

====Francium====
Francium is also predicted to show some differences due to its high [[atomic weight]], causing its electrons to travel at considerable fractions of the speed of light and thus making [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]] more prominent. In contrast to the trend of decreasing [[electronegativity|electronegativities]] and [[ionisation energy|ionisation energies]] of the alkali metals, francium's electronegativity and ionisation energy are predicted to be higher than caesium's due to the relativistic stabilisation of the 7s electrons; also, its [[atomic radius]] is expected to be abnormally low.&lt;!--Haire says this happens for Uue because of the analogous effect for 8s - seems likely for Fr too--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title = The Chemistry of the Actinide and Transactinide Elements| editor1-last = Morss|editor2-first = Norman M.| editor2-last = Edelstein| editor3-last = Fuger|editor3-first = Jean| last1 = Hoffman|first1 = Darleane C.| last2=Lee|first2=Diana M. |last3=Pershina|first3=Valeria | chapter = Transactinides and the future elements| publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media]]| year = 2006| isbn = 1-4020-3555-1| location = Dordrecht, The Netherlands| edition = 3rd| ref = CITEREFHaire2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1729}}&lt;ref name=&quot;andreev&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Andreev, S.V.; Letokhov, V.S.; Mishin, V.I., | title = Laser resonance photoionization spectroscopy of Rydberg levels in Fr | url = http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v59/p1274 | journal = [[Physical Review Letters|Phys.

All the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers; hence, their isotopes must be either [[odd-odd nuclei|odd-odd]] (both proton and [[neutron number]] are odd) or [[odd-even nuclei|odd-even]] ([[proton number]] is odd, but neutron number is even). Odd-odd nuclei have even [[mass number]]s, while odd-even nuclei have odd mass numbers. Odd-odd [[primordial nuclide]]s are rare because most odd-odd nuclei are highly unstable with respect to [[beta decay]], because the decay products are even-even, and are therefore more strongly bound, due to [[Semi-empirical mass formula#Pairing term|nuclear pairing effects]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lide02&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Various authors|editor-last=Lide |editor-first=David R. | year=2002 | title=Handbook of Chemistry &amp; Physics | edition=88th | publisher=CRC | url=http://www.hbcpnetbase.com/ | accessdate=2008-05-23 | isbn=0-8493-0486-5 | oclc=179976746 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the great rarity of odd-odd nuclei, almost all the primordial isotopes of the alkali metals are odd-even (the exceptions being the light stable isotope lithium-6 and the long-lived [[radioisotope]] potassium-40 and rubidium-87). For a given odd mass number, there can be only a single [[beta-decay stable isobars|beta-stable nuclide]], since there is not a difference in binding energy between even-odd and odd-even comparable to that between even-even and odd-odd, leaving other nuclides of the same mass number ([[isobar (nuclide)|isobar]]s) free to [[beta decay]] toward the lowest-mass nuclide. An effect of the instability of an odd number of either type of nucleons is that odd-numbered elements, such as the alkali metals, tend to have fewer stable isotopes than even-numbered elements. Of the 26 [[monoisotopic element]]s that have only a single stable isotope, all but one have an odd atomic number and all but one also have an even number of neutrons. [[Beryllium]] is the single exception to both rules, due to its low atomic number.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lide02&quot;/&gt;

All of the alkali metals except lithium and caesium have at least one naturally occurring [[radioisotope]]: [[sodium-22]] and [[sodium-24]] are [[trace radioisotope]]s produced [[cosmogenic]]ally,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nucleonica.net/unc.aspx |title=Universal Nuclide Chart |date=2007–2012 |work=Nucleonica |publisher=Institute for Transuranium Elements |accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; potassium-40 and [[rubidium-87]] have very long [[half-life|half-lives]] and thus occur naturally,&lt;ref name=&quot;nuclideschart&quot;/&gt; and all [[isotopes of francium]] are [[radioactive decay|radioactive]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nuclideschart&quot;/&gt; Caesium was also thought to be radioactive in the early 20th century,&lt;ref name=&quot;Patt1926&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/cr60009a003 | title = The Radioactivity of the Alkali Metals | year = 1926 | last1 = Patton | first1 = I.

The metal reacts with the water first, breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing [[hydrogen]] gas; this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals. Second, the heat generated by the first part of the reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas, causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air. This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water).&lt;ref name=&quot;alkalibangs&quot;/&gt; The alkali metal hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides.&lt;ref name=Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw/&gt;{{rp|87}}

Lithium, the lightest of the alkali metals, is the only alkali metal which reacts with [[nitrogen]] at [[standard conditions]], and its [[nitride]] is the only stable alkali metal nitride. Nitrogen is an [[reactivity (chemistry)|unreactive]] gas because breaking the strong [[triple bond]] in the [[dinitrogen]] molecule (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) requires a lot of energy. The formation of an alkali metal nitride would consume the ionisation energy of the alkali metal (forming M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions), the energy required to break the triple bond in N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the formation of N&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; ions, and all the energy released from the formation of an alkali metal nitride is from the [[lattice energy]] of the alkali metal nitride. The lattice energy is maximised with small, highly charged ions; the alkali metals do not form highly charged ions, only forming ions with a charge of +1, so only lithium, the smallest alkali metal, can release enough lattice energy to make the reaction with nitrogen [[exothermic]], forming [[lithium nitride]]. The reactions of the other alkali metals with nitrogen would not release enough lattice energy and would thus be [[endothermic]], so they do not form nitrides at standard conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;alkalireact&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group1/reacto2.html#top |title=Reaction of the Group 1 Elements with Oxygen and Chlorine |author=Clark, Jim |year=2005 |work=chemguide |accessdate=27 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Sodium nitride]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N) and [[potassium nitride]] (K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N), while existing, are extremely unstable, being prone to decomposing back into their constituent elements, and cannot be produced by reacting the elements with each other at standard conditions.)&lt;ref name=Jansen1&gt;{{cite journal|title=Synthesis and structure of Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N|author=Fischer, D., Jansen, M.|journal= Angew Chem|volume=41|issue=10|page=1755|year=2002|doi=10.1002/1521-3773(20020517)41:10&lt;1755::AID-ANIE1755&gt;3.0.CO;2-C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jansen2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Synthesis and structure of K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N|author=Fischer, D.; Cancarevic, Z.; Schön, J.

All the alkali metals react readily with [[phosphorus]] and [[arsenic]] to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Pn (where M represents an alkali metal and Pn represents a [[pnictogen]]).

All the alkali metals react vigorously with [[oxygen]] at standard conditions. They form various types of oxides, such as simple [[oxide]]s (containing the O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ion), [[peroxide]]s (containing the {{chem|O|2|2-}} ion, where there is a [[single bond]] between the two oxygen atoms), [[superoxide]]s (containing the {{chem|O|2|-}} ion), and many others. Lithium burns in air to form [[lithium oxide]], but sodium reacts with oxygen to form a mixture of [[sodium oxide]] and [[sodium peroxide]]. Potassium forms a mixture of [[potassium peroxide]] and [[potassium superoxide]], while rubidium and caesium form the superoxide exclusively. Their reactivity increases going down the group: while lithium, sodium and potassium merely burn in air, rubidium and caesium are [[pyrophoric]] (spontaneously catch fire in air).&lt;ref name=&quot;alkalireact&quot;/&gt;

The smaller alkali metals tend to polarise the more complex anions (the peroxide and superoxide) due to their small size. This attracts the electrons in the more complex anions towards one of its constituent oxygen atoms, forming an oxide ion and an oxygen atom. This causes lithium to form the oxide exclusively on reaction with oxygen at room temperature. This effect becomes drastically weaker for the larger sodium and potassium, allowing them to form the less stable peroxides. Rubidium and caesium, at the bottom of the group, are so large that even the least stable superoxides can form. Because the superoxide releases the most energy when formed, the superoxide is preferentially formed for the larger alkali metals where the more complex anions are not polarised. (The oxides and peroxides for these alkali metals do exist, but do not form upon direct reaction of the metal with oxygen at standard conditions.)&lt;ref name=&quot;alkalireact&quot;/&gt; In addition, the small size of the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ions contributes to their forming a stable ionic lattice structure. Under controlled conditions, however, all the alkali metals, with the exception of francium, are known to form their oxides, peroxides, and superoxides. The alkali metal peroxides and superoxides are powerful [[oxidizing agent]]s. [[Sodium peroxide]] and [[potassium superoxide]] react with [[carbon dioxide]] to form the alkali metal carbonate and oxygen gas, which allows them to be used in [[submarine]] air purifiers; the presence of [[water vapour]], naturally present in breath, makes the removal of carbon dioxide by potassium superoxide even more efficient.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lindsay |first1=D.

Rubidium can form Rb&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O and Rb&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; upon oxidation in air, while caesium forms an immense variety of oxides, such as the ozonide CsO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1007/BF00845494|title =Synthesis of cesium ozonide through cesium superoxide|year =1963|last1 =Vol'nov|first1 =I.

The alkali metals can also react analogously with the heavier chalcogens ([[sulfur]], [[selenium]], [[tellurium]], and [[polonium]]), and all the alkali metal chalcogenides are known (with the exception of francium's).

===Hydrides and halides===
{{main|Alkali metal halide}}
The alkali metals are among the most [[electropositive]] elements on the periodic table and thus tend to [[ionic bond|bond ionically]] to the most [[electronegative]] elements on the periodic table, the [[halogen]]s, forming [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] known as the alkali metal halides. The reaction is very vigorous and can sometimes result in explosions.&lt;ref name=Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw/&gt;{{rp|76}} This includes [[sodium chloride]], otherwise known as common salt. The reactivity becomes higher from lithium to caesium and drops from [[fluorine]] to [[iodine]]. All of the alkali metal halides have the formula MX where M is an alkali metal and X is a halogen. They are all white ionic crystalline solids.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alkalireact&quot;/&gt; All the alkali metal halides are [[solubility|soluble]] in water except for [[lithium fluoride]] (LiF), which is insoluble in water due to its very high [[lattice enthalpy]]. The high lattice enthalpy of lithium fluoride is due to the small sizes of the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and F&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ions, causing the [[electrostatic interaction]]s between them to be strong:&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt; a similar effect occurs for [[magnesium fluoride]], which lithium has a diagonal relationship with.&lt;ref name=Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw/&gt;{{rp|76}} The alkali metals also react similarly with hydrogen to form ionic alkali metal hydrides.&lt;ref name=&quot;generalchemistry&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Averill |first1=Bruce A. |last2=Eldredge |first2=Patricia |title=Chemistry: Principles, Patterns, and Applications with Student Access Kit for Mastering General Chemistry |url=http://2012books.lardbucket.org/books/general-chemistry-principles-patterns-and-applications-v1.0/section_25_03.html |accessdate=24 June 2013 |year=2007 |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=1st |isbn=9780805337990 |chapter=21.3: The Alkali Metals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alkali metal cations do not usually form [[coordination complex]]es with simple [[Lewis base]]s due to their low charge of just +1 and their relatively large size; thus the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less. In [[aqueous solution]], the alkali metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes ([M(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), with the exception of the lithium ion, which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes ([Li(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;); the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar water molecules. Because of this, [[anhydrous]] salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as [[desiccant]]s.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry/&gt; Alkali metals also readily form complexes with [[crown ether]]s (e.g. [[12-crown-4]] for Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, [[15-crown-5]] for Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and [[18-crown-6]] for K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and [[cryptand]]s due to electrostatic attraction.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry/&gt;

===Ammonia solutions===
Unlike most metals, the alkali metals dissolve slowly in liquid [[ammonia]], forming hydrogen gas and the [[metal amide#Alkali metal amides|alkali metal amide]] (MNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where M represents an alkali metal): this was first noted by [[Humphry Davy]] in 1809 and rediscovered by W. Weyl in 1864. The process may be speeded up by a [[catalyst]]. The amide salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution, leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions of the alkali metals. In 1907, Charles Krause&lt;!--don't link; the one being referred to has no article on WP yet--&gt; identified the colour as being due to the presence of [[solvated electron]]s, which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions. At low concentrations (below 3 M), the solution is dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous [[sodium chloride]]; at higher concentrations (above 3 M), the solution is copper-coloured and has approximately the conductivity of liquid metals like [[mercury (element)|mercury]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=generalchemistry/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;c&amp;w&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Cotton  |first=F.A. |first2=G.|last2=Wilkinson |title=Advanced Inorganic Chemistry |year=1972 |publisher=John Wiley and Sons Inc |location= |isbn=0-471-17560-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the alkali metal amide salt and solvated electrons, such ammonia solutions also contain the alkali metal cation (M&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), the neutral alkali metal atom (M), [[diatomic molecule|diatomic]] alkali metal molecules (M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and alkali metal anions (M&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). These are unstable and eventually become the more thermodynamically stable alkali metal amide and hydrogen gas.

Being the smallest alkali metal, lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable [[organometallic compound]]s, which are bonded covalently. [[Organolithium reagent|Organolithium]] compounds are electrically non-conducting volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures, and tend to form [[oligomer]]s with the structure (RLi)&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; where R is the organic group. As the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the [[charge density]] of the bond on the carbon atom, effectively creating a [[carbanion]], organolithium compounds are extremely powerful [[base (chemistry)|base]]s and [[carbon nucleophile|nucleophile]]s. For use as bases, [[butyllithium]]s are often used and are commercially available. An example of an organolithium compound is [[methyllithium]] ((CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Li)&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;), which exists in tetrameric (''x'' = 4) and hexameric (''x'' = 6) forms.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brown1957 &gt;{{ cite journal | author = Brown, T.

The application of [[organosodium chemistry|organosodium]] compounds in chemistry is limited in part due to competition from [[organolithium compound]]s, which are commercially available and exhibit more convenient reactivity. The principal organosodium compound of commercial importance is [[sodium cyclopentadienide]]. [[Sodium tetraphenylborate]] can also be classified as an organosodium compound since in the solid state sodium is bound to the aryl groups. Organometallic compounds of the higher alkali metals are even more reactive than organosodium compounds and of limited utility. A notable reagent is [[Schlosser's base]], a mixture of [[n-Butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]] and [[potassium tert-butoxide|potassium ''tert''-butoxide]]. This reagent reacts with [[propene]] to form the compound [[allylpotassium]] (KCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CHCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). [[cis-2-butene|''cis''-2-Butene]] and [[trans-2-butene|''trans''-2-butene]] equilibrate when in contact with alkali metals. Whereas [[isomerization]] is fast with lithium and sodium, it is slow with the higher alkali metals. The higher alkali metals also favour the [[steric hindrance|sterically]] congested conformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Superbases for organic synthesis | author = Manfred Schlosser | journal = Pure and Appl.

Although francium is the heaviest alkali metal that has been discovered, there has been some theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics of the hypothetical heavier alkali metals. Being the first [[period 8 element]], the undiscovered element [[ununennium]] (element 119) is predicted to be the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter [[Congener (chemistry)|congener]]s; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} Its chemistry is predicted to be closer to that of potassium&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; or rubidium&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} instead of caesium or francium. This is unusual as [[periodic trends]], ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium. This lowered [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]] is due to the relativistic stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron, increasing ununennium's first ionisation energy and decreasing the [[metallic radius|metallic]] and [[ionic radius|ionic radii]];&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt; this effect is already seen for francium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} This assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an alkali metal, which, although likely, may not be true due to relativistic effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;tanm&quot;/&gt; The relativistic stabilisation of the 8s orbital also increases ununennium's [[electron affinity]] far beyond that of caesium and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it. Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the [[polarisability]] of ununennium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} On the other hand, ununennium is predicted to continue the trend of melting points decreasing going down the group, being expected to have a melting point between 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 30&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1724}}

The stabilisation of ununennium's valence electron and thus the contraction of the 8s orbital cause its atomic radius to be lowered to 240&amp;nbsp;[[picometer|pm]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} very close to that of rubidium (247&amp;nbsp;pm),&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt; so that the chemistry of ununennium in the +1 oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of rubidium than to that of francium. On the other hand, the ionic radius of the Uue&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is predicted to be larger than that of Rb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, because the 7p orbitals are destabilised and are thus larger than the p-orbitals of the lower shells. Ununennium may also show the +3 [[oxidation state]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} which is not seen in any other alkali metal,&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot;/&gt;{{rp|28}} in addition to the +1 oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkali metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkali metals: this is because of the destabilisation and expansion of the 7p&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt; spinor, causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionisation energy than what would otherwise be expected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot;/&gt;{{rp|28}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} Indeed, many ununennium compounds are expected to have a large [[covalent]] character, due to the involvement of the 7p&lt;sub&gt;3/2&lt;/sub&gt; electrons in the bonding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thayer&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Chemistry of heavier main group elements|last=Thayer|first=John S.|doi=10.1007/9781402099755_2|year=2010|pages=81, 84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not as much work has been done predicting the properties of the alkali metals beyond ununennium. Although a simple extrapolation of the periodic table would put element 169, unhexennium, under ununennium, Dirac-Fock calculations predict that the next alkali metal after ununennium may actually be element 165, unhexpentium, which is predicted to have the electron configuration [Uuo] 5g&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; 6f&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; 7d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; 8s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 8p&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 9s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}}&lt;ref name=&quot;pyykko&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Pyykkö|first1=Pekka|title=A suggested periodic table up to Z ≤ 172, based on Dirac–Fock calculations on atoms and ions|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|volume=13|issue=1|pages=161–8|year=2011|pmid=20967377|doi=10.1039/c0cp01575j|bibcode = 2011PCCP...13..161P }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further calculations show that unhexpentium would follow the trend of increasing ionisation energy beyond caesium, having an ionisation energy comparable to that of sodium, and that it should also continue the trend of decreasing atomic radii beyond caesium, having an atomic radius comparable to that of potassium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1729–1730}} However, the 7d electrons of unhexpentium may also be able to participate in chemical reactions along with the 9s electron, possibly allowing oxidation states beyond +1 and perhaps even making unhexpentium behave more like a [[boron group]] element or [[group 11 element]] than an alkali metal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1732–1733}}&lt;ref name=BFricke&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fricke |first1=Burkhard |year=1975 |title=Superheavy elements: a prediction of their chemical and physical properties |journal=Recent Impact of Physics on Inorganic Chemistry |volume=21 |pages=89–144 |doi=10.1007/BFb0116498 |url=http://www.researchgate.net/publication/225672062_Superheavy_elements_a_prediction_of_their_chemical_and_physical_properties |accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the alkali and [[alkaline earth metal]]s both being [[s-block]] elements, these predictions for the trends and properties of ununennium and unhexpentium also mostly hold quite similarly for the corresponding alkaline earth metals [[unbinilium]] (Ubn) and unhexhexium (Uhh).&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1729–1733}}

The probable properties of further alkali metals beyond unhexpentium have not been explored yet as of 2012. In periods 8 and above of the periodic table, relativistic and shell-structure effects become so strong that extrapolations from lighter congeners become completely inaccurate. In addition, the relativistic and shell-structure effects (which stabilise the s-orbitals and destabilise and expand the d-, f-, and g-orbitals of higher shells) have opposite effects, causing even larger difference between relativistic and non-relativistic calculations of the properties of elements with such high atomic numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uue&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1732–1733}} Interest in the chemical properties of ununennium and unhexpentium stems from the fact that both elements are located close to the expected locations of [[island of stability|islands of stabilities]], centered at elements 122 (&lt;sup&gt;306&lt;/sup&gt;Ubb) and 164 (&lt;sup&gt;482&lt;/sup&gt;Uhq).&lt;ref name=Kratz&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Kratz |first1=J.

The [[group 11 element|group 11 metals]] (or coinage metals), [[copper]], [[silver]], and [[gold]], are typically categorised as transition metals given they can form ions with incomplete d-shells. Physically, they have the relatively low melting points and high electronegativity values associated with [[post-transition metal]]s. &quot;The filled ''d'' subshell and free ''s'' electron of Cu, Ag, and Au contribute to their high electrical and thermal conductivity. Transition metals to the left of group 11 experience interactions between ''s'' electrons and the partially filled ''d'' subshell that lower electron mobility.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Russell AM &amp; Lee KL 2005, [http://books.google.com/books?id=fIu58uZTE-gC&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Structure-property relations in nonferrous metals]'', p.&amp;nbsp;302. Wiley-Interscience, New York, ISBN 047164952X&lt;/ref&gt; Chemically, the group 11 metals behave like main-group metals in their +1 valence states, and are hence somewhat related to the alkali metals: this is one reason for their previously being labelled as &quot;group IB&quot;, paralleling the alkali metals' &quot;group IA&quot;. They are occasionally classified as post-transition metals.&lt;ref&gt;Deming HG 1940, ''Fundamental Chemistry,'' John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, pp.&amp;nbsp;705–7&lt;/ref&gt; Their spectra are however analogous to those of the alkali metals.&lt;ref name=Jensen/&gt;

In Mendeleev's 1871 periodic table, copper, silver, and gold are listed twice, once under group VIII (with the [[iron triad]] and [[platinum group metal]]s), and once under group IB. Group IB was nonetheless parenthesized to note that it was tentative. Mendeleev's main criterion for group assignment was the maximum oxidation state of an element: on that basis, the group 11 elements could not be classified in group IB, due to the existence of Cu(II) and Au(III) compounds being known at that time.&lt;ref name=Jensen/&gt; However, eliminating group IB would make group I the only main group (group VIII was labelled a transition group) to lack an A–B bifurcation.&lt;ref name=Jensen/&gt; Soon afterwards, a majority of chemists chose to classify these elements in group IB and remove them from group VIII for the resulting symmetry: this was the predominant classification until the rise of the modern medium-long 18-column periodic table, which separated the alkali metals and group 11 metals.&lt;ref name=Jensen/&gt;

The coinage metals were traditionally regarded as a subdivision of the alkali metal group, due to them sharing the characteristic s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; electron configuration of the alkali metals (group 1: p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; group 11: d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;). However, the similarities are largely confined to the [[stochiometry|stochiometries]] of the +1 compounds of both groups, and not their chemical properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1177}} This stems from the filled d subshell providing a much weaker shielding effect on the outermost s electron than the filled p subshell, so that the coinage metals have much higher first ionization energies and smaller ionic radii than do the corresponding alkali metals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1177}} Furthermore, they have higher melting points, hardnesses, and densities, and lower reactivities and solubilities in liquid [[ammonia]], as well as having more covalent character in their compounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1177}} Finally, the alkali metals are at the top of the [[electrochemical series]], whereas the coinage metals are almost at the very bottom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1177}} The coinage metals' filled d shell is much more easily disrupted than the alkali metals' filled p shell, so that the second and third ionization energies are lower, enabling higher oxidation states than +1 and a richer coordination chemistry, thus giving the group 11 metals clear [[transition metal]] character.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1177}} Particularly noteworthy is gold forming ionic compounds with rubidium and caesium, in which it forms the auride ion (Au&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) which also occurs in solvated form in liquid ammonia solution: here gold behaves as a [[pseudohalogen]] because its 5d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;6s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; configuration has one electron less than the quasi-closed shell 5d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;6s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; configuration of [[mercury (element)|mercury]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1177}}

==Occurrence==

===In the Solar System===
[[File:SolarSystemAbundances.png|thumb|right|800px|Estimated abundances of the chemical elements in the Solar system. Hydrogen and helium are most common, from the [[Big Bang]]. The next three elements (lithium, [[beryllium]], and [[boron]]) are rare because they are poorly synthesized in the Big Bang and also in stars. The two general trends in the remaining stellar-produced elements are: (1) an alternation of abundance in elements as they have even or odd atomic numbers, and (2) a general decrease in abundance, as elements become heavier. Iron is especially common because it represents the minimum energy nuclide that can be made by fusion of helium in supernovae.&lt;ref name=lodders&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lodders | first1 = Katharina | year = 2003 | title = Solar System Abundances and Condensation Temperatures of the Elements | url = | journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 591 | issue = 2| pages = 1220–1247 |bibcode = 2003ApJ...591.1220L |doi = 10.1086/375492 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Oddo-Harkins rule]] holds that elements with even atomic numbers are more common that those with odd atomic numbers, with the exception of hydrogen. This rule argues that elements with odd atomic numbers have one unpaired proton and are more likely to capture another, thus increasing their atomic number.  In elements with even atomic numbers, protons are paired, with each member of the pair offsetting the spin of the other, enhancing stability.&lt;ref name=oddo&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1002/zaac.19140870118 | title = Die Molekularstruktur der radioaktiven Atome | year = 1914 | last1 = Oddo | first1 = Giuseppe | journal = Zeitschrift für anorganische Chemie | volume = 87 | pages = 253}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=harkins&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja02250a002 | year = 1917 | last1 = Harkins | first1 = William D. | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 39 | issue = 5 | pages = 856 | title = The Evolution of the Elements and the Stability of Complex Atoms.

The heavier alkali metals are also less abundant than the lighter ones as the alkali metals from rubidium onward can only be synthesized in [[supernova]]e and not in [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]. Lithium is also much less abundant than sodium and potassium as it is poorly synthesized in both [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]] and in stars: the Big Bang could only produce trace quantities of lithium, [[beryllium]] and [[boron]] due to the absence of a stable nucleus with 5 or 8 [[nucleon]]s, and stellar nucleosynthesis could only pass this bottleneck by the [[triple-alpha process]], fusing three helium nuclei to form [[carbon]], and skipping over those three elements.&lt;ref name=lodders/&gt;

===On Earth===
[[File:Spodumene-usa59abg.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Spodumene]], an important lithium mineral]]
The [[Earth]] formed from the same cloud of matter that formed the Sun, but the planets acquired different compositions during the [[formation and evolution of the solar system]]. In turn, the [[history of Earth|natural history of the Earth]] caused parts of this planet to have differing concentrations of the elements. The mass of the Earth is approximately 5.98{{e|24}}&amp;nbsp;kg. It is composed mostly of [[iron]] (32.1%), [[oxygen]] (30.1%), [[silicon]] (15.1%), [[magnesium]] (13.9%), [[sulfur]] (2.9%), [[nickel]] (1.8%), [[calcium]] (1.5%), and [[aluminium]] (1.4%); with the remaining 1.2% consisting of trace amounts of other elements. Due to [[mass segregation]], the core region is believed to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.&lt;ref name=pnas71_12_6973&gt;{{cite journal | author=Morgan, J.

The alkali metals, due to their high reactivity, do not occur naturally in pure form in nature. They are [[Goldschmidt classification|lithophiles]] and therefore remain close to the Earth's surface because they combine readily with [[oxygen]] and so associate strongly with [[silica]], forming relatively low-density minerals that do not sink down into the Earth's core. Potassium, rubidium and caesium are also [[incompatible element]]s due to their large [[ionic radius|ionic radii]].&lt;ref name=&quot;albarede&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Geochemistry: an introduction | url = http://books.google.de/books?id=doVGzreGq14C&amp;pg=PA17 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-521-89148-6 | first =Francis | last = Albarède }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of pure alkali metals is difficult due to their extreme reactivity with commonly used substances, such as water. The alkali metals are so reactive that they cannot be [[single displacement reaction|displaced]] by other elements and must be isolated through high-energy methods such as electrolysis.&lt;ref name=&quot;rsc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=generalchemistry/&gt;

Lithium salts have to be extracted from the water of [[mineral spring]]s, [[brine]] pools, and brine deposits.

From their [[silicate]] ores, all the alkali metals may be obtained the same way: [[sulfuric acid]] is first used to dissolve the desired alkali metal ion and [[aluminium]](III) ions from the ore (leaching), whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture by precipitating it as the [[aluminium hydroxide|hydroxide]]. The remaining insoluble alkali metal [[carbonate]] is then precipitated selectively; the salt is then dissolved in [[hydrochloric acid]]. The result is then left to evaporate and the alkali metal can then be isolated through [[electrolysis]].&lt;ref name=generalchemistry/&gt;

Lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides, with [[calcium chloride]] typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture. The heavier alkali metals, however, is more typically isolated in a different way, where a reducing agent (typically sodium for potassium and [[magnesium]] or [[calcium]] for the heaviest alkali metals) is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride. The liquid or gaseous product (the alkali metal) then undergoes [[fractional distillation]] for purification.&lt;ref name=generalchemistry/&gt;

==Applications==

All of the discovered alkali metals excluding francium have many applications. Lithium is often used in [[lithium-ion battery|batteries]], and [[lithium oxide]] can help process silica. Lithium can also be used to make lubricating greases, air treatment, and aluminium production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=USGS |year=2011|title=Lithium|url= http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/lithium/mcs-2011-lithi.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2011|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
