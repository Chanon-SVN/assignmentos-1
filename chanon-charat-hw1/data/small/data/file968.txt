{{American and British English differences|US flag first}}

'''American English''' is a set of [[dialect]]s of the [[English language]] used mostly in the [[United States]]. Approximately two-thirds of the world's [[first language|native speakers]] of English live in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crystal|first=David|authorlink=David Crystal|year=1997|title=English as a Global Language|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-53032-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]] of American English that is most free from regional, ethnic, or cultural distinctions is the accent known as [[General American]].

English is the most widely spoken language in the United States. English is the common language used by the federal government and is considered the [[de facto]] language of the United States due to its widespread use. English has been given official status by 30 of the 50 state governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.languagepolicy.net/archives/langleg.htm |title=Language Legislation in the U.S.A. |publisher=languagepolicy.net |date=1 February 2012 |author=Crawford, James |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.us-english.org/view/13 |title=States with Official English Laws |publisher=us-english.org |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, while both Spanish and English have equivalent status in the local courts of the [[Commonwealth of Puerto Rico]], under federal law, English is the official language for any matters being referred to the [[United States District Court]] for the territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/48/864 48 USC § 864&amp;nbsp;– Appeals, certiorari, removal of causes, etc.; use of English language | Title 48&amp;nbsp;– Territories and Insular Possessions | U.S. Code | LII / Legal Information Ins...&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of English in the United States is a result of [[British colonization of the Americas|British colonization]]. The first wave of English-speaking settlers arrived in [[North America]] during the 17th century, followed by further migrations in the 18th and 19th centuries. Since then, American English has been influenced by the languages of [[West Africa]], the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] population, [[German language|German]], [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and other languages of successive waves of immigrants to the U.S.

Compared with [[English language in England|English as spoken in England]], North American English&lt;ref&gt;''[[North American English]]'' (Trudgill, p. 2) is a collective term used for the varieties of the English language that are spoken in the United States and [[Canada]].&lt;/ref&gt; is more homogeneous. Some distinctive accents can be found on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] (for example, in eastern [[New England]], New York City, Philadelphia, and Baltimore) partly because these areas were in close contact with [[England]] and imitated prestigious varieties of English at a time when these were undergoing changes.&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many speech communities on the East Coast have existed in their present locations for centuries, while the interior of the country was settled by people from all regions of the existing United States and developed a far more general linguistic pattern.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

[[Image:Non rhotic-whites-usa.png|thumb|250px|The red areas are those where non-rhotic pronunciations are found among some Caucasians in the United States. [[African American Vernacular English|AAVE]]-influenced non-rhotic pronunciations may be heard from [[African American Vernacular English|AAVE speakers]] throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;Labov, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Studies on historical usage of English in the United States and the United Kingdom suggest that spoken American English did not simply evolve from British English, but rather retained many archaic features [[British English]] has since lost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-the-difference-between-theater-and-theatre.htm WiseGeek.org What is the difference between Theater and Theatre?]&lt;/ref&gt; Most North American speech is [[Rhoticity in English|rhotic]], as English was in most places in the 17th century. Rhoticity was further supported by [[Hiberno-English]], [[West Country English]] and [[Scottish English]] as well as the fact most regions of England at this time also had rhotic accents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=25484343 |url=http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/25484343?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21102054774863 |title=Early Mainland Residues in Southern Hiberno-English |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most varieties of North American English, the sound corresponding to the letter ''r'' is an [[alveolar approximant]] {{IPA|[ɹ]}} or [[retroflex approximant|retroflex]] {{IPA|[ɻ]}} rather than a trill or a tap. The loss of syllable-final ''r'' in North America is confined mostly to the accents of [[Boston accent|eastern New England]], [[New York-New Jersey English|New York City]] and surrounding areas and the coastal portions of the [[Southern American English|South]], and [[African American Vernacular English]].

In rural [[tidewater Virginia]] and eastern New England, 'r' is non-rhotic in accented (such as &quot;bird&quot;, &quot;work&quot;, &quot;first&quot;, &quot;birthday&quot;) as well as unaccented syllables, although this is declining among the younger generation of speakers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Dropping of syllable-final ''r'' sometimes happens in natively rhotic dialects if ''r'' is located in unaccented syllables or words and the next syllable or word begins in a consonant (for example, many North Americans drop the first 'r' in &quot;particular&quot;). In England, the lost ''r'' was often changed into {{IPA|[ə]}} ([[schwa]]), giving rise to a new class of falling [[diphthong]]s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Furthermore, the ''er'' sound of ''f'''ur''''' or ''butt'''er''''', is realized in AmE as a [[monophthong]]al [[r-colored vowel]] (stressed {{IPA|[ɝ]}} or unstressed {{IPA|[ɚ]}} as represented in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} This does not happen in the non-rhotic varieties of North American speech.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Some other English changes in which most North American dialects do not participate:
* The regular realization of intervocalic {{IPA|/t/}} as a glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}} (as in {{IPA|[ˈbɑʔɫ̩]}} for ''bottle''). The only environment in which t-glottalization is standard in American English is before &quot;n&quot;, as in &quot;button&quot; {{IPA|[ˈbʌʔn̩]}}.

On the other hand, North American English has undergone some sound changes not found in other varieties of English speech:
* The [[Phonological history of the low back vowels#Father–bother merger|merger of {{IPA|/ɑ/}} and {{IPA|/ɒ/}}]], making ''father'' and ''bother'' rhyme. This change is nearly universal in North American English. Exceptions are accents in northeastern New England, such as the [[Boston accent]], and in [[New York City English|New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriamwebster.com/help/pronguide.htm Merriam Webster Pronunciation Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wells&gt;{{cite book |author=[[John C.

(2006), p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The merger of {{IPA|/ɑ/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} in many areas.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} This is the so-called [[cot–caught merger]], where ''cot'' and ''caught'' are [[homophone]]s. This change has occurred in eastern New England (Boston area), in [[Pittsburgh English|Pittsburgh]] and surrounding areas, and from the [[Great Plains]] westward.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

* For speakers who do not merge ''caught'' and ''cot'': The replacement of the ''cot'' vowel with the ''caught'' vowel before [[voiceless fricative]]s (as in ''cloth, off'' [which is found in some old-fashioned varieties of RP]), as well as before {{IPA|/ŋ/}} (as in ''strong, long),'' usually in ''gone,'' often in ''on,'' and irregularly before {{IPA|/ɡ/}} ''(log, hog, dog, fog'' [which is not found in British English at all]).

* The replacement of the ''lot'' vowel with the ''strut'' vowel in most utterances of the words ''was, of, from, what'' and in many utterances of the words ''everybody, nobody, somebody, anybody;'' the word ''because'' has either {{IPA|/ɔ/}} or {{IPA|/ʌ/}}. This is directly due to influence of the [[Irish language]].&lt;ref&gt;According to ''Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary, Eleventh Edition''. For speakers who merge ''caught'' and ''cot'', {{IPA|/ɔ/}} is to be understood as the vowel they have in both ''caught'' and ''cot''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Want'' has normally {{IPA|/ɔ/}} or {{IPA|/ɑ/}}, sometimes {{IPA|/ʌ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.infoplease.com/want |title=want: meaning and definitions |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/55/W0025500.html |title=want.

* [[English-language vowel changes before historic r|Vowel merger]] before intervocalic {{IPA|/ɹ/}}. Which vowels are affected varies between dialects, but the [[Mary–marry–merry merger|Mary-marry-merry]], [[Mirror–nearer merger|nearer-mirror]], and [[English-language vowel changes before historic r#Hurry–furry merger|hurry–furry]] mergers are all widespread. Americans vary slightly in their pronunciations of [[R-colored vowel#Rhotacization|R-colored vowels]]&amp;mdash;such as those in {{IPA|/ɛəɹ/}} and {{IPA|/ɪəɹ/}}&amp;mdash;sometimes monophthongizing towards {{IPA|[ɛɹ]}} and {{IPA|[ɪɹ]}} or [[tenseness|tensing]] towards {{IPA|[eɪɹ]}} and {{IPA|[i(ə)ɹ]}} respectively, causing pronunciations like {{IPA|[pʰeɪɹ]}} for ''pair''/''pear'' and {{IPA|[pʰiəɹ]}} for ''peer''/''pier''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Accents of English|volume=3|publisher=Cambridge University Press|author=J. C. Wells|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=484eVQ7t8TMC&amp;dq=accents+of+english+cambridge&amp;q=481#v=onepage&amp;q=%22long%20vowels%20before%20%2Fr%2F%22&amp;f|pages=481–482}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, {{IPA|/jʊər/}} is often reduced to {{IPA|[jɚ]}}, so that ''cure'', ''pure'', and ''mature'' may all end with the sound {{IPA|[ɚ]}}, thus rhyming with ''blur'' and ''sir''. The word ''sure'' is also part of this rhyming set as commonly pronounced {{IPA|[ʃɚ]}}.

* [[English consonant-cluster reductions#''Yod''-dropping|Dropping of {{IPA|/j/}}]] is more extensive than in RP. In most North American accents, {{IPA|/j/}} is dropped after all [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] and interdental consonant, so that ''new, duke, Tuesday, presume'' are pronounced {{IPA|[nu]}}, {{IPA|[duk]}}, {{IPA|[ˈtʰuzdeɪ]}}, {{IPA|[pʰɹɪˈzum]}}.

* [[æ-tensing|/æ/ tensing]] in environments that vary widely from accent to accent. With most American speakers, for whom the phoneme {{IPA|/æ/}} operates under a somewhat continuous system, {{IPA|/æ/}} has both a tense and a lax [[allophone]] (with a kind of &quot;continuum&quot; of possible sounds between those two extremes, rather than a definitive split). In these accents, {{IPA|/æ/}} is overall realized before [[nasal stop]]s as more tense (approximately {{IPA|[eə̯]}}), while other environments are more lax (approximately the standard {{IPA|[æ]}}); for example, note the vowel sound in {{IPA|[mæs]}} for ''mass'',  but {{IPA|[meə̯n]}} for ''man''). In some American accents, though, specifically those from [[Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[New York City]], {{IPA|[æ]}} and {{IPA|[eə̯]}} are entirely separate (or &quot;split&quot;) phonemes, for example, in '''''planet''''' {{IPA|[pʰɫænɪ̈t̚]}} vs. '''''plan it''''' {{IPA|[pʰɫeənɪ̈t̚]}}. This is often called the Mid-Atlantic [[Phonological history of English short A#Phonemic æ tensing in the Mid-Atlantic region|split-''a'']] system. Note that these vowels move in the opposite direction in the mouth compared to the backed British &quot;broad A&quot;; the phenomenon has been noted as related to the increasingly rare phenomenon of older speakers of the eastern New England (Boston) area who {{IPA|/æ/}} to {{IPA|/ɑ/}} (the so-called &quot;[[broad A]]&quot;) before {{IPA|/f/, /s/, /θ/, /ð/, /z/, /v/}} alone or when preceded by a [[homorganic]] nasal.

* [[Flapping]] of intervocalic {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} to [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}} before unstressed vowels (as in ''bu'''tt'''er'' {{IPA|[ˈbʌɾəɹ]}}, ''par'''t'''y'' {{IPA|[ˈpʰɑɹɾi]}}) and syllabic {{IPA|/l/}} (''bo'''tt'''le'' {{IPA|[ˈbɑɾəɫ]}}), as well as at the end of a word or morpheme before any vowel (''wha'''t''' else'' {{IPA|[wʌˈɾɛɫs]}}, ''wha'''t'''ever'' {{IPA|[wʌˈɾɛvəɹ]}}). Thus, for most speakers, pairs such as ''ladder/latter, metal/medal,'' and ''coating/coding'' are pronounced the same, except with the stressed {{IPA|/aɪ/}} (see below).

* [[Canadian raising]] of {{IPA|/aɪ/}}: many speakers split the sound {{IPA|/aɪ/}} based on its presence before either a voiceless or voiced consonant, so that in ''writer'' it is pronounced {{IPA|[ʌɪ]}} but in ''rider'' it is pronounced {{IPA|[aɪ]}}. This is a form of [[Canadian raising]] but, unlike more extreme forms of that process, does not affect {{IPA|/aʊ/}}. In many areas and idiolects, a phonemic distinction between what elsewhere become homophones through this process is maintained by vowel lengthening in the vowel preceding the formerly voiced consonant, ''e.g.'', {{IPA|[ˈɹʌɪɾɚ]}} for &quot;writer&quot; as opposed to {{IPA|[ˈɹaɪɾɚ]}} for &quot;rider&quot;.

*[[T glottalization]] is common when {{IPA|/t/}} is in the final position of a syllable or word (''get'', ''fretful'': {{IPA|[ɡɛʔ]}}, {{IPA|[ˈfɹɛʔfəɫ]}}), though this is always superseded by the aforementioned rules of flapping

*L-velarization: the typical English distinction between a &quot;clear L&quot; (i.e. [[l (IPA)|{{IPA|[l]}}]]) and a &quot;dark L&quot; (i.e. [[velarized alveolar lateral approximant|{{IPA|[ɫ]}}]] or sometimes even [[Velar lateral approximant|{{IPA|[ʟ]}}]]) is much less noticeable in most dialects of American English; it may even be altogether absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Language Talent and Brain Activity: Trends in Applied Linguistics|editors=Grzegorz Dogil, Susanne Maria Reiterer, and
Walter de Gruyter|year=2009|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH|page=299|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pfIGxRtdXsQC&amp;pg=PA299&amp;dq=&quot;general+american&quot;+&quot;velarized&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, most American speakers pronounce even the &quot;clear&quot; variant as more or less &quot;dark&quot;, meaning with some degree of [[velarization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Jones|Roach|Hartman|2006|p=xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Both intervocalic {{IPA|/nt/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} may commonly be realized as {{IPA|[ɾ̃]}} or simply {{IPA|[n]}}, making ''winter'' and ''winner'' homophones. In most areas where {{IPA|/nt/}} is reduced to {{IPA|/n/}}, it is accompanied further by nasalization of simple post-vocalic {{IPA|/n/}}{{vague|date=April 2014}}, so that {{IPA|/Vnt/}} and {{IPA|/Vn/}} remain phonemically distinct. In such cases, the preceding vowel becomes nasalized, and is followed in cases where the former {{IPA|/nt/}} was present, by a distinct{{vague|date=April 2014}} {{IPA|/n/}}. This stop-absorption by the preceding nasal {{IPA|/n/}} does not occur when the second syllable is stressed, as in ''entail''.

*[[Phonological history of the high front vowels#Pin–pen merger|pin–pen merger]] occurs in certain areas, by which {{IPA|[ɛ]}} is raised to {{IPA|[ɪ]}} before nasal stops, making pairs like ''pen/pin'' [[homophonous]]. This merger originated in [[Southern American English]] but is now also sometimes found in parts of the Midwest and West as well, especially in people with roots in the mountainous areas of the [[Southeastern United States]].

*[[Weak-vowel merger]] of the vowel {{IPA|/ə/}} and {{IPA|/ɪ/}} is generally present in unstressed syllables toward the sound {{IPA|/ɪ̈/}}.

Some mergers found in most varieties of both American and British English include:{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
*[[Horse–hoarse merger|merger]] of the vowels {{IPA|/ɔ/}} and {{IPA|/o/}} before 'r', making pairs like ''horse/hoarse, corps/core, for/four, morning/mourning,'' etc. [[homophones]].

*[[wine–whine merger]] making pairs like ''wine/whine, wet/whet, Wales/whales, wear/where,'' etc. [[homophone]]s, in most cases eliminating {{IPA|/ʍ/}}, the [[voiceless labiovelar fricative]]. Many older varieties of southern and western American English still keep these distinct, but the merger appears to be spreading.

The languages of the other colonising nations also added to the American vocabulary; for instance, ''[[cookie]]'', ''[[cruller]]'', ''[[Urban stoop|stoop]]'', and ''pit'' (of a fruit) from [[Dutch Language|Dutch]]; ''[[angst]], [[kindergarten]], [[sauerkraut]]'' from [[German language|German]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://german.about.com/library/blvoc_gerloan.htm About.com&amp;nbsp;– German Loan Words in English]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[levee]], portage'' (&quot;carrying of boats or goods&quot;) and (probably) ''[[gopher (animal)|gopher]]'' from [[French language|French]]; ''[[barbecue]], [[stevedore]], and [[rodeo]]'' from [[Spanish language|Spanish]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://repository.upenn.edu/dissertations/AAI9308630/ &quot;The history of Mexican folk foodways of South Texas: Street vendors, o&quot; by Mario Montano&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ROmDu-bYMRYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=rodeo+etymology&amp;ots=Q8MWUXWWeS&amp;sig=1mCnpypy9pF4E4WoGV_gSVXElGk#v=onepage&amp;q=rodeo&amp;f=false What's in a word?: etymological ...&amp;nbsp;– Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=p1krAAAAYAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=gaufre+gopher&amp;ots=00ds4J1VBe&amp;sig=DF3qa0vDjd2mxhMb0IW1Nmu_OB0#v=onepage&amp;q=gaufre%20&amp;f=false GOPHER]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=osQAtpUtDvkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=dutch+words+american+english&amp;ots=sMZL8QrNdq&amp;sig=SM1AA9RcONfDv1AwJ1DXDqkmf8U#v=onepage&amp;q=stoop&amp;f=false The American Language: A Preliminary ...&amp;nbsp;– Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the earliest and most notable regular &quot;English&quot; additions to the American vocabulary, dating from the early days of colonization through the early 19th century, are terms describing the features of the North American landscape; for instance, ''run, branch, fork, [[wikt:snag|snag]], [[hill|bluff]], [[gulch]], neck'' (of the woods), ''barrens, [[bottomland]], notch, knob, riffle, [[rapid]]s, watergap, cutoff, [[trail]], [[tree line|timberline]]'' and ''[[water divide|divide]]''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. Already existing words such as ''[[stream|creek]], [[swamp|slough]], [[Ice pellets|sleet]]'' and (in later use) ''[[Drainage basin|watershed]]'' received new meanings that were unknown in England.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Other noteworthy American [[toponym]]s are found among loanwords; for example, ''[[prairie]], [[butte]]'' (French); ''[[bayou]]'' ([[Choctaw]] via Louisiana French); ''[[coulee]]'' (Canadian French, but used also in Louisiana with a different meaning); ''[[canyon]], [[mesa]], [[arroyo (creek)|arroyo]]'' (Spanish); ''vlei, skate, [[kill (body of water)|kill]]'' (Dutch, [[Hudson Valley]]).

The word ''[[wikt:corn|corn]]'', used in England to refer to wheat (or any cereal), came to denote the plant ''[[Zea mays]]'', the most important crop in the U.S., originally named ''[[Indian corn]]'' by the earliest settlers; wheat, rye, barley, oats, etc. came to be collectively referred to as ''[[grain]]''. Other notable farm related vocabulary additions were the new meanings assumed by ''[[barn]]'' (not only a building for hay and grain storage, but also for housing livestock) and ''team'' (not just the horses, but also the vehicle along with them), as well as, in various periods, the terms ''[[rangeland|range]], [[corn crib|(corn) crib]], [[truck farm|truck]], [[grain elevator|elevator]], [[sharecropping]]'' and ''[[feedlot]].''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

''[[Ranch]],'' later applied to a [[ranch house|house style]], derives from [[Mexican Spanish]]; most Spanish contributions came after the [[War of 1812]], with the opening of the West. Among these are, other than toponyms, ''[[chaps]]'' (from ''chaparreras), [[plaza]], [[lasso]], [[bronco]], [[Wikt:buckaroo|buckaroo]], [[rodeo]];'' examples of &quot;English&quot; additions from the [[cowboy]] era are ''bad man, maverick, chuck'' (&quot;food&quot;) and ''[[Boot Hill]];'' from the [[California Gold Rush]] came such idioms as ''hit pay dirt'' or ''strike it rich.'' The word ''blizzard'' probably originated in the West. A couple of notable late 18th century additions are the verb ''belittle'' and the noun ''bid,'' both first used in writing by [[Thomas Jefferson]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

With the new continent developed new forms of dwelling, and hence a large inventory of words designating real estate concepts ''(land office, [[Land lot|lot]], outlands, waterfront,'' the verbs ''locate'' and ''relocate, betterment, addition, subdivision),'' types of property ''([[log cabin]], [[adobe]]'' in the 18th century; ''[[frame house]], [[apartment]], tenement house, [[shack]], [[Wikt:shanty|shanty]]'' in the 19th century; ''project, [[condominium]], [[townhouse]], [[split-level home|split-level]], [[mobile home]], multi-family'' in the 20th century), and parts thereof ''([[driveway]], breezeway, [[backyard]], dooryard; [[Clapboard (architecture)|clapboard]], [[siding]], trim, [[baseboard]]; stoop'' (from Dutch), ''family room, den;'' and, in recent years, ''[[HVAC]], [[central air]], walkout basement).''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Ever since the [[American Revolution]], a great number of terms connected with the U.S. political institutions have entered the language; examples are ''run (i.e, for office), gubernatorial, [[primary election]], [[carpetbagger]]'' (after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]), ''repeater'', ''[[lame duck (politics)|lame duck]]'' (a [[United Kingdom|British]] term used originally in Banking)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.word-detective.com/back-f.html |title=Lame Duck |publisher=Word Detective.com |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[pork barrel]].'' Some of these are internationally used (for example, ''[[caucus]], [[gerrymander]], [[filibuster]], [[exit poll]]).''

====19th century onwards====
The development of industry and material innovations throughout the 19th and 20th centuries were the source of a massive stock of distinctive new words, phrases and idioms. Typical examples are the vocabulary of ''[[railroad]]ing'' (see further at [[rail terminology]]) and ''[[transport]]ation'' terminology, ranging from names of roads (from ''dirt roads'' and ''back roads'' to ''[[freeway]]s'' and ''[[parkway]]s)'' to road infrastructure ''([[parking lot]], [[overpass]], [[rest area]]),'' and from automotive terminology to ''[[public transit]]'' (for example, in the sentence &quot;''riding'' the ''subway downtown''&quot;); such American introductions as ''commuter'' (from ''commutation ticket), [[concourse]], to board'' (a vehicle), ''to park, double-park'' and ''parallel park'' (a car), ''[[Wikt:double decker|double decker]]'' or the noun ''terminal'' have long been used in all dialects of English.&lt;ref&gt;A few of these are now chiefly found, or have been more productive, outside of the U.S.; for example, ''jump,'' &quot;to drive past a traffic signal;&quot; ''block'' meaning &quot;building,&quot; and ''center,'' &quot;central point in a town&quot; or &quot;main area for a particular activity&quot; (cf. Oxford English Dictionary).&lt;/ref&gt;

Trades of various kinds have endowed (American) English with household words describing jobs and occupations ''([[bartender]], longshoreman, patrolman, [[hobo]], [[bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]], bellhop, [[roustabout]], [[White-collar worker|white collar]], [[blue collar]], [[employee]], boss'' [from Dutch], ''[[intern]], [[busboy]], [[mortician]], [[senior citizen]]),'' businesses and workplaces ''([[department store]], [[supermarket]], [[thrift store]], [[gift shop]], [[Pharmacy|drugstore]], [[motel]], [[main street]], [[gas station]], [[hardware store]], [[Savings and loan association|savings and loan]], hock'' [also from Dutch]), as well as general concepts and innovations ''([[automated teller machine]], [[smart card]], [[cash register]], [[dishwasher]], reservation'' [as at hotels], ''pay envelope, [[movie]], mileage, [[shortage]], [[power outage|outage]], [[blood bank]]).''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Already existing English words—such as ''[[General store|store]], [[Retailing|shop]], dry goods, [[haberdashery]], [[lumber]]''—underwent shifts in meaning; some—such as ''[[wiktionary:Mason|mason]], student, [[clerk (position)|clerk]]'', the verbs ''can'' (as in &quot;canned goods&quot;), ''ship, fix, carry, enroll'' (as in school), ''run'' (as in &quot;run a business&quot;), ''release'' and ''haul''—were given new significations, while others (such as ''[[tradesman]])'' have retained meanings that disappeared in England. From the world of business and finance came ''[[breakeven]], [[merger]], [[Wikt:delisting|delisting]], [[downsize]], [[disintermediation]], [[Net income|bottom line]];'' from sports terminology came, jargon aside, ''Monday-morning quarterback, cheap shot, game plan'' ([[American football|football]]); ''in the [[ballpark]], out of [[left field]], off base, hit and run,'' and [[English language idioms derived from baseball|many other idioms]] from [[baseball]]; gamblers coined ''[[bluff (poker)|bluff]], [[Wikt:blue chip|blue chip]], [[Betting (poker)#Ante|ante]], bottom dollar, raw deal, pass the buck, ace in the hole, freeze-out, showdown;'' miners coined ''[[bedrock]], bonanza, peter out, pan out'' and the verb ''prospect'' from the noun; and railroadmen are to be credited with ''make the [[grade (slope)|grade]], sidetrack, head-on,'' and the verb ''railroad.'' A number of Americanisms describing material innovations remained largely confined to North America: ''[[elevator]], [[ground (electricity)|ground]], [[gasoline]];'' many automotive terms fall in this category, although many do not ''([[hatchback]], [[sport utility vehicle]], [[station wagon]], [[trunk (automobile)#Tailgate|tailgate]], [[motorhome]], [[truck]], [[pickup truck]], to exhaust).''{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In addition to the above-mentioned loans from French, Spanish, Mexican Spanish, Dutch, and Native American languages, other accretions from foreign languages came with 19th and early 20th century immigration; notably, from [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] ''([[chutzpah]], schmooze, tush'') and [[German language|German]]—''[[hamburger]]'' and culinary terms like ''frankfurter/franks, liverwurst, sauerkraut, [[Hot dog|wiener]], [[delicatessen|deli(catessen)]]; [[scram]], [[kindergarten]], [[Responses to sneezing|gesundheit]];''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=19970923 |title=The Maven's Word of the Day: gesundheit |publisher=[[Random House]] |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; musical terminology ''([[whole note]], [[half note]],'' etc.); and apparently ''[[cookbook]], fresh'' (&quot;impudent&quot;) and ''what gives?'' Such constructions as ''Are you coming with?'' and ''I like to dance'' (for &quot;I like dancing&quot;) may also be the result of German or Yiddish influence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Trudgill|Trudgill, Peter]] (2004). ''New-Dialect Formation: The Inevitability of Colonial Englishes''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, a large number of English colloquialisms from various periods are American in origin; some have lost their American flavor (from ''[[Okay|OK]]'' and ''cool'' to ''[[nerd]]'' and ''[[24/7]]),'' while others have not ''([[have a nice day]], for sure);''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl?nav=on&amp;which_entry=009421%23x1%23x1%23day&amp;selected_word=day&amp;search_word=day |title=Definition of day noun from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oup.com/oald-bin/web_getald7index1a.pl?nav=on&amp;which_entry=036903%23x1%23x1%23sure&amp;selected_word=sure&amp;search_word=sure#sure_adv |title=Definition of sure adjective from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; many are now distinctly old-fashioned ''(swell, groovy).'' Some English words now in general use, such as ''hijacking, [[disc jockey]], boost, bulldoze'' and ''[[jazz]],'' originated as American slang. Among the many English idioms of U.S. origin are ''get the hang of, bark up the wrong tree, keep tabs, run scared, take a backseat, have an edge over, stake a claim, take a shine to, in on the ground floor, bite off more than one can chew, off/on the wagon, stay put, inside track, [[stiff upper lip]], bad hair day, [[monkeywrenching|throw a monkey wrench]], under the weather, jump bail, come clean, come again?, it ain't over till it's over, what goes around comes around,'' and ''will the real x please stand

===Morphology===
American English has always shown a marked tendency [[functional shift|to use nouns as verbs]].&lt;ref name = &quot;iqiyyl&quot;&gt;Trudgill, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of verbed nouns are ''interview, advocate, vacuum, lobby, pressure, rear-end, transition, feature, profile, spearhead, skyrocket, showcase, service'' (as a car), ''corner, torch, exit'' (as in &quot;exit the lobby&quot;), ''factor'' (in mathematics), ''gun'' (&quot;shoot&quot;), ''author'' (which disappeared in English around 1630 and was revived in the U.S. three centuries later) and, out of American material, ''proposition, graft'' (bribery), ''bad-mouth, [[vacation]], major, [[backpack]], [[backtracking|backtrack]], intern, ticket'' (traffic violations), ''hassle, [[asphalt concrete|blacktop]], peer-review, dope'' and ''[[Drug overdose|OD]]'', and, of course ''verbed'' as used at the start of this sentence.

[[Compound (linguistics)|Compound]]s coined in the U.S. are for instance ''[[foothill]], [[flatlands]], [[badlands]], [[landslide]]'' (in all senses), ''[[:wikt:overview|overview]]'' (the noun), ''[[Wikt:backdrop|backdrop]], [[teenager]], [[brainstorming|brainstorm]], [[Wikt:bandwagon|bandwagon]], [[hitchhike]], smalltime, [[Wikt:deadbeat|deadbeat]], [[frontman]], lowbrow'' and ''highbrow, hell-bent, foolproof, nitpick, about-face'' (later verbed), ''upfront'' (in all senses), ''fixer-upper, no-show;'' many of these are phrases used as adverbs or (often) hyphenated attributive adjectives: ''[[non-profit]], [[for-profit]], free-for-all, ready-to-wear, catchall, low-down, down-and-out, down and dirty, in-your-face, nip and tuck;'' many compound nouns and adjectives are open: ''[[happy hour]], [[fall guy]], [[capital gain]], [[road trip]], wheat pit, head start, [[plea bargain]];'' some of these are colorful ''([[empty nester]], [[loan shark]], [[Wikt:ambulance chaser|ambulance chaser]], [[buzz saw]], [[ghetto blaster]], dust bunny),'' others are euphemistic ''([[differently abled]] (physically challenged), [[human resources]],  [[affirmative action]], [[correctional facility]]).''

Many compound nouns have the form verb plus preposition: ''[[Wikt:add-on|add-on]], stopover, lineup, [[Wikt:shakedown|shakedown]], tryout, spin-off, [[rundown]]'' (&quot;summary&quot;), ''[[shootout]], [[holdup]], hideout, comeback, cookout, [[Bribery|kickback]], [[makeover]], [[takeover]], rollback'' (&quot;decrease&quot;), ''rip-off, come-on, shoo-in, fix-up, tie-in, tie-up'' (&quot;stoppage&quot;), ''stand-in.'' These essentially are nouned [[phrasal verb]]s; some prepositional and phrasal verbs are in fact of American origin ''(spell out, figure out, hold up, brace up, size up, rope in, back up/off/down/out, step down, miss out, kick around, cash in, rain out, check in'' and ''check out'' (in all senses), ''fill in'' (&quot;inform&quot;), ''kick in'' or ''throw in'' (&quot;contribute&quot;), ''square off, sock in, sock away, factor in/out, come down with, give up on, lay off'' (from employment), ''run into'' and ''across'' (&quot;meet&quot;), ''stop by, pass up, put up'' (money), ''set up'' (&quot;frame&quot;), ''trade in, pick up on, pick up after, lose out).''&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50232893?]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50084582/50084582se12?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=figure+out&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;hilite=50084582se12]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50107109/50107109se53?query_type=word&amp;queryword=hold+up&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=f2Cb-qlNYMH-4067&amp;hilite=50107109se53]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50225951/50225951se1?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=size+up&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;hilite=50225951se1]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50208750?]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50016263/50016263se19?query_type=word&amp;queryword=back+up&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=f2Cb-8eN1ib-4115&amp;hilite=50016263se19]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50237099/50237099se24?query_type=word&amp;queryword=step+down&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=2&amp;search_id=f2Cb-GnUl9A-4127&amp;hilite=50237099se24]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00311905?query_type=word&amp;queryword=miss&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=6&amp;search_id=f2Cb-GT1q2L-4137&amp;hilite=00311905]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50126465?]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50196574?query_type=word&amp;queryword=rain+out&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;single=1&amp;sort_type=alpha]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50034059/50034059se1?query_type=word&amp;queryword=cash+in&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=1&amp;search_id=f2Cb-smXBXz-4166&amp;hilite=50034059se1]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50081535?query_type=word&amp;queryword=factor&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=3&amp;search_id=f2Cb-KGfO1T-4176&amp;hilite=50081535]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50084734/50084734se18?query_type=word&amp;queryword=fill+in&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;sort_type=alpha&amp;result_place=2&amp;search_id=f2Cb-USt2E6-4186&amp;hilite=50084734se18]{{dead link|date=March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;British author [[George Orwell]] (in ''English People'', 1947, cited in OED s.v. ''lose)'' criticized an alleged &quot;American tendency&quot; to &quot;burden every verb with a preposition that adds nothing to its meaning (''win out'', ''lose out'', ''face up to'', etc.)&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Noun endings such as ''-ee (retiree), -ery (bakery), -ster (gangster)'' and ''-cian (beautician)'' are also particularly productive.&lt;ref name = &quot;iqiyyl&quot;/&gt; Some verbs ending in ''-ize'' are of U.S. origin; for example, ''fetishize, prioritize, burglarize, accessorize, itemize, editorialize, customize, notarize, [[weatherization|weatherize]], winterize, [[Miranda v. Arizona|Mirandize]];'' and so are some [[back-formation]]s ''(locate, fine-tune, evolute, curate, donate, emote, upholster, peeve'' and ''enthuse).'' Among syntactical constructions that arose in the U.S. are ''as of'' (with dates and times), ''outside of, headed for, meet up with, back of, convince someone to, not about to'' and ''lack for.''

Americanisms formed by alteration of some existing words include notably ''pesky, phony, rambunctious, pry'' (as in &quot;pry open&quot;, from ''prize), putter'' (verb), ''buddy, [[sundae]], skeeter, sashay'' and ''kitty-corner.'' Adjectives that arose in the U.S. are for example, ''lengthy, bossy, [[cuteness|cute]]'' and ''cutesy, grounded'' (of a child), ''punk'' (in all senses), ''sticky'' (of the weather), ''through'' (as in &quot;through train&quot;, or meaning &quot;finished&quot;), and many colloquial forms such as ''peppy'' or ''wacky''. American [[Blend word|blend]]s include ''[[motel]], guesstimate, [[infomercial]]'' and ''[[televangelist]].''

===English words that survived in the United States and not in the United Kingdom===
A number of words and meanings that originated in [[Middle English]] or [[Early Modern English]] and that have been in everyday use in the United States dropped out in most varieties of British English; some of these have cognates in [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowland Scots]]. Terms such as ''[[autumn|fall]]'' (&quot;autumn&quot;), ''[[faucet]]'' (&quot;tap&quot;), ''[[diaper]]'' (&quot;nappy&quot;), ''[[candy]]'' (&quot;sweets&quot;), ''[[Frying pan|skillet]]'', ''[[eyeglasses]]'' and ''[[obligate]]'' are often regarded as Americanisms. ''Fall'' for example came to denote the season in 16th century England, a contraction of Middle English expressions like &quot;fall of the leaf&quot; and &quot;fall of the year&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|fall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th century, [[British colonization of the Americas|English immigration to the British colonies]] in North America was at its peak and the new settlers took the English language with them. While the term ''fall'' gradually became obsolete in Britain, it became the more common term in North America. ''Gotten'' ([[past participle]] of ''get'') is often considered to be an Americanism, although there are some areas of [[UK|Britain]], such as [[Lancashire]] and [[North East England]], that still continue to use it and sometimes also use ''putten'' as the past participle for ''put'' (which is not done by most speakers of American English).&lt;ref&gt;''A Handbook of Varieties of English'', Bernd Kortmann &amp; Edgar W. Schneider, Walter de Gruyter, 2004, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other words and meanings, to various extents, were brought back to Britain, especially in the second half of the 20th century; these include ''hire'' (&quot;to employ&quot;), ''quit'' (&quot;to stop&quot;, which spawned ''quitter'' in the U.S.), ''I guess'' (famously criticized by [[H. W. Fowler]]), ''[[baggage]]'', ''hit'' (a place), and the adverbs ''overly'' and ''presently'' (&quot;currently&quot;). Some of these, for example ''[[monkey wrench]]'' and ''[[wastebasket]]'', originated in 19th century Britain.

The mandative [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] (as in &quot;the City Attorney suggested that the case ''not be closed''&quot;) is livelier in American English than it is in British English. It appears in some areas as a spoken usage and is considered obligatory in contexts that are more formal. The adjectives ''mad'' meaning &quot;angry&quot;, ''smart'' meaning &quot;intelligent&quot;, and ''sick'' meaning &quot;ill&quot; are also more frequent in American (these meanings are also frequent in Hiberno-English) than British English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.com/images/elt/oald7/synald7_angry.gif |title=angry |publisher=Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fds.oup.com/www.oup.com/images/elt/oald7/synald7_intelligent.gif |title=intelligent |publisher=Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oald8.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/dictionary/ill |title=Definition of ill adjective from the Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary |publisher= |deadurl=no |accessdate=29 May 2013}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional differences==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Huckleberry Hound]]; [[Northeastern American English]] redirects here --&gt;
{{Main|Regional vocabularies of American English|North American English regional phonology}}

While written American English is standardized across the country, there are several recognizable variations in the spoken language, both in pronunciation and in vernacular vocabulary. ''[[General American]]'' is the name given to any [[American accent]] that is relatively free of noticeable regional influences.

===Eastern seaboard===
After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the settlement of the western territories by migrants from the Eastern U.S. led to dialect mixing and leveling, ([[koineization]]) so that regional dialects are most strongly differentiated along the [[East]]ern [[Coast|seaboard]]. The [[Connecticut River]] and [[Long Island Sound]] is usually regarded as the southern/western extent of New England speech, which has its roots in the speech of the Puritans from [[East Anglia]] who settled in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]].

The [[Potomac River]] generally divides a group of Northern coastal dialects from the beginning of the Coastal Southern dialect area; in between these two rivers several local variations exist, chief among them the one that prevails in and around [[New York City]] and northern [[New Jersey]], which developed on a Dutch [[substratum]] after the English conquered New Amsterdam. The main features of Coastal Southern speech can be traced to the speech of the English from the [[West Country]] who settled in Virginia after leaving England at the time of the [[English Civil War]].

===Midwest===
A distinctive speech pattern also appears near the border between [[Canada]] and the United States, centered on the [[Great Lakes]] region (but only on the American side). This is the [[Inland Northern American English|Inland North Dialect]]—the &quot;standard Midwestern&quot; speech that was the basis for General American in the mid-20th century (although it has been recently modified by the [[northern cities vowel shift]]). Those not from this area frequently confuse it with the North Midland dialect treated below, referring to both collectively as &quot;Midwestern&quot; in the Mid-Atlantic region or &quot;Northern&quot; in the Southern US. The so-called '&quot;[[North Central American English|Minnesotan]]&quot; dialect is also prevalent in the cultural [[Upper Midwest]], and is characterized by influences from the German and Scandinavian settlers of the region (like &quot;yah&quot; for yes, pronounced similarly to &quot;ja&quot; in German, Norwegian and Swedish). In parts of [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Ohio]], another dialect known as [[Pennsylvania Dutch English]] is also spoken.

===Interior===
In the interior, the situation is very different. West of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] begins the broad zone of what is generally called &quot;[[Midland American English|Midland]]&quot; speech. This is divided into two discrete subdivisions, the North Midland that begins north of the [[Ohio River]] valley area, and the South Midland speech; sometimes the former is designated simply &quot;Midland&quot; and the latter is reckoned as &quot;Highland Southern&quot;. The North Midland speech continues to expand westward until it becomes the closely related Western dialect which contains [[Pacific Northwest English]] as well as the well-known [[California English]], although in the immediate [[San Francisco]] area some older speakers do not possess the [[cot–caught merger]] and thus retain the distinction between words such as cot and caught which reflects a historical Mid-Atlantic heritage.

The South Midland or Highland Southern dialect follows the [[Ohio River]] in a generally southwesterly direction, moves across [[Arkansas]] and [[Oklahoma]] west of the [[Mississippi river|Mississippi]], and peters out in [[West Texas]]. It is a version of the Midland speech that has assimilated some coastal Southern forms (outsiders often mistakenly believe South Midland speech and coastal South speech to be the same).

Although no longer region-specific,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Trudgill, p.42.&lt;/ref&gt; [[African American Vernacular English]], which remains prevalent among [[African American]]s, has a close relationship to Southern varieties of AmE and has greatly influenced everyday speech of many Americans.

The island state of Hawaii has a distinctive [[Hawaiian Pidgin]].

Finally, dialect development in the United States has been notably influenced by the distinctive speech of such important cultural centers as [[Baltimore]], [[Boston]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[Cleveland]], [[Chicago]], [[Detroit]], [[Miami]], [[New Orleans]], [[New York City]], [[Philadelphia]] and [[Pittsburgh]],   which imposed their marks on the surrounding areas.

==Differences between British and American English==
{{Main|Comparison of American and British English}}
American English and [[British English]] (BrE) differ at the levels of phonology, phonetics, vocabulary, and, to a much lesser extent, grammar and orthography.
The first large American dictionary, ''[[Webster's dictionary|An American Dictionary of the English Language]]'', was written by [[Noah Webster]] in 1828; Webster intended to show that the United States, which was a relatively new country at the time, spoke a different dialect from that of Britain.

Differences in grammar are relatively minor, and normally do not affect mutual intelligibility; these include: different use of some [[verbal auxiliaries]]; formal (rather than notional) agreement with [[collective noun]]s; different preferences for the past forms of a few verbs (for example, AmE/BrE: ''learned''/''learnt'', ''burned''/''burnt'', ''snuck/sneaked'', ''dove/dived''); different prepositions and adverbs in certain contexts (for example, AmE ''in school,'' BrE ''at school''&lt;!--when it means &quot;to be a student&quot;--&gt;); and whether or not a definite article is used, in very few cases (AmE ''to the hospital'', BrE ''to hospital''; contrast, however, AmE ''actress Elizabeth Taylor'', BrE ''the actress Elizabeth Taylor''). Often, these differences are a matter of relative preferences rather than absolute rules; and most are not stable, since the two varieties are constantly influencing each other.&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, John (2006). ''British or American English?''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-37993-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in [[orthography]] are also minor. The main differences are that American English uses spellings such as ''flavor'' for British ''flavour'', ''fiber'' for ''fibre'', ''defense'' for ''defence'', ''analyze'' for ''analyse'', ''catalog'' for ''catalogue'' and ''traveling'' for ''travelling''. Noah Webster popularized such spellings in America, but he did not invent most of them. Rather, &quot;he chose already existing options [...] on such grounds as simplicity, analogy or etymology&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Algeo, John. &quot;The Effects of the Revolution on Language&quot;, in ''A Companion to the American Revolution''. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008. p.599&lt;/ref&gt; Other differences are due to the [[francophile]] tastes of 19th century [[Victorian era|Victorian England]] (for example they preferred ''programme'' for ''program'', ''manoeuvre'' for ''maneuver'', ''cheque'' for ''check'', etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Pam (2004). ''The Cambridge Guide to English Usage''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-62181-X, pp. 34 and 511.&lt;/ref&gt; AmE uses ''-ize'' in words like ''realize''. BrE prefers ''-ise'', but also uses ''-ize'' (see [[Oxford spelling]]).

AmE sometimes favors words that are [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] more complex, whereas BrE uses clipped forms, such as AmE ''transportation'' and BrE ''transport'' or where the British form is a [[back-formation]], such as AmE ''burglarize'' and BrE ''burgle'' (from ''burglar''). However, while individuals usually use one or the other, both forms will be widely understood and mostly used alongside each other within the two systems.
