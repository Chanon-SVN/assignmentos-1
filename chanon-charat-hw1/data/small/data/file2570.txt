The '''brown bear''' (''Ursus arctos'') is a large [[bear]] distributed across much of northern [[Eurasia]] and [[North America]]. Adult bears generally weigh between {{convert|100|and|635|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.

There are several recognized subspecies within the brown bear species. In North America, two types of the subspecies ''Ursus arctos horribilis'' are generally recognized—the coastal brown bear and the inland [[grizzly bear]]; these two types broadly define the range of sizes of all brown bear subspecies. An adult grizzly living inland in [[Yukon]] may weigh as little as {{convert|80|kg|abbr=on|round=0}}, while an adult coastal brown bear in nearby coastal [[Alaska]] living on a steady, nutritious diet of spawning [[salmon]] may weigh as much as {{convert|680|kg|abbr=on|round=0}}.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt; The exact number of overall brown subspecies remains in debate.

While the brown bear's range has shrunk and it has faced local extinctions, it remains listed as a [[least concern]] species by the [[IUCN]] with a total population of approximately 200,000. As of 2012, this and the [[American black bear]] are the only bear species not classified as threatened by the IUCN. However, the [[California golden bear|Californian]], [[Atlas bear|North African (Atlas bear)]], and [[Mexican grizzly bear|Mexican]] subspecies were hunted to extinction in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and many of the southern Asian subspecies are highly endangered. The smallest subspecies, the [[Himalayan brown bear]], is critically endangered, occupying only 2% of its former range and threatened by uncontrolled poaching for its parts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.com/2014/01/06/himalayan-brown-bears-now-critically-endangered/ Himalayan brown bears now critically endangered] 01-06-2014&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Marsican brown bear]] in central [[Italy]] is believed to have a population of just 30 to 40 bears.

The brown bear's principal range includes parts of [[Russia]], [[India]], [[China]], [[Canada]], the [[United States]] (mostly [[Alaska]]), [[Scandinavia]] and the [[Carpathian]] region (especially [[Romania]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=Paul|title=Brown Bear|url=http://www.transylvanianwildlifeproject.com/p/brown-bear.html|publisher=Transylvania Wildlife Project|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519162400/http://www.transylvanianwildlifeproject.com/p/brown-bear.html|archivedate=19 May 2013|accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brown bear is recognized as a national and state animal in several European countries. It is the most widely distributed of all bears.

==Naming and etymology==
The brown bear is sometimes referred to as the ''bruin'', from [[Middle English]]. This name originated in the fable, ''History of [[Reynard the Fox]]'', translated by [[William Caxton]], from [[Middle Dutch]] ''bruun'' or ''bruyn'', meaning ''[[brown]]'' (the color).&lt;ref&gt;American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Old West]], the grizzly was termed &quot;Old Ephraim&quot; and sometimes as &quot;Moccasin Joe&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rooseeltv&quot;&gt;[http://www.fulltextarchive.com/page/Hunting-the-Grisly-and-Other-Sketches1/#p58 Hunting the Grisly and other Sketches]. FullTextArchive.com. Retrieved 2011-09-15.&lt;/ref&gt;
The scientific name of the brown bear, ''Ursus arctos'', comes from the Latin &quot;[[Ursus (disambiguation)|ursus]]&quot;, meaning &quot;bear&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, Henry George and Scott, Robert. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dursus &quot;Ursus.&quot;] ''A Latin Dictionary''. Perseus Digital Library.&lt;/ref&gt; and Άρκτος &quot;arctos&quot;, from the Greek word for bear.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell, Henry George and Scott, Robert.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2315199 &quot;Arktos.&quot;] ''A Greek-English Lexicon''. Perseus Digital Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy and evolution==
Brown bears are thought to have evolved from ''[[Ursus etruscus]]''. The oldest fossils occur in China from about 0.5 [[mya (unit)|million years ago]]. They entered Europe about 250,000 years ago, and North Africa shortly after. Brown bear remains from the Pleistocene period are common in the [[British Isles]], where it is thought they outcompeted [[cave bear]]s. The species entered Alaska 100,000 years ago, though they did not move south until 13,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;evolution&quot;/&gt; It is thought brown bears were unable to migrate south until the extinction of the much larger ''[[Arctodus simus]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;geist&quot;/&gt; Several paleontologists suggest the possibility of two separate brown bear migrations: grizzlies are thought to stem from narrow-skulled bears which migrated from northern Siberia to central Alaska and the rest of the continent, while Kodiak bears descend from broad-skulled bears from Kamchatka, which colonized the Alaskan peninsula. Brown bear fossils discovered in Ontario, Ohio, Kentucky and Labrador show the species occurred farther east than indicated in historic records.&lt;ref name=&quot;evolution&quot;&gt;Bruce McLellan and David C. Reiner (1994). [http://www.bearbiology.com/fileadmin/tpl/Downloads/URSUS/Vol_9/McLellan_Reiner_Vol_9.pdf A Review of bear evolution] Int. Conf. Bear Res. and Manage. 9(1):85–96&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subspecies===
There is little agreement on classification of brown bears. Some systems have proposed as many as 90 subspecies, while recent DNA analysis has identified as few as five clades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bearinfo.org/YESFedRegister.pdf |title=Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants; Designating the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem Population of Grizzly Bears as a Distinct Population Segment; Removing the Yellowstone Distinct Population Segment of Grizzly Bears From the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife |accessdate=August 1, 2006 |author=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service |date=2006-11-17 |publisher=Federal Register / Vol. 70, No. 221 |pages=69854–69884 |format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060825042929/http://www.bearinfo.org/YESFedRegister.pdf |archivedate = August 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA analysis recently revealed that the identified subspecies of brown bears, both Eurasian and North American, are genetically quite homogeneous, and that their genetic [[phylogeography]] does not correspond to their traditional taxonomy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waits&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Waits, L.P., et al. | year = 1998 | title = Mitochondrial DNA Phylogeography of the North American Brown Bear and Implications for Conservation | journal = Conservation Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 408–417 | doi = 10.1111/j.1523-1739.1998.96351.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2005, 16 living subspecies have been recognized.&lt;ref&gt;{{MSW3 Wozencraft | id =14000970 | pages = 588-589|heading = ''Ursus arctos''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&amp;search_value=180543 ''Ursus arctos''], ITIS&lt;/ref&gt; The subspecies have been listed as follows:

===Hybrids===
{{Main|Grizzly–polar bear hybrid}}
A grizzly–polar bear hybrid (known as a ''pizzly bear'' or ''grolar bear'') is a rare [[ursid hybrid]] resulting from a union of a brown bear and a [[polar bear]]. It has occurred both in captivity and in the wild. In 2006, the occurrence of this hybrid in nature was confirmed by testing the [[DNA]] of a strange-looking bear that had been shot in the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[arctic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;msn&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/12738644/?GT1=8199 |title=Wild find: Half grizzly, half polar bear: Hunter bags what expert 'never thought would happen' in wild |publisher=MSNBC.MSN.com |date=May 11, 2006 |accessdate=2006-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mallet&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Hybridization, ecological races and the nature of species: empirical evidence for the ease of speciation |author=[[James Mallet]] |year=2008 |issue= 1506|pages=2971–2986 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0081 |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]] B |url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/taxome/jim/pap/Mallet08%20Phil%20Trans.pdf |volume=363 |pmid=18579473 |pmc=2607318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;barnosky&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Heatstroke: Nature in an Age of Global Warming |author=Barnosky, Anthony D. |year=2009 |isbn=1-59726-197-1 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Di6SVZZjLAgC&amp;pg=PA10|publisher=Island Press/Shearwater Books |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, the hybrid had been produced in [[zoo]]s, and was considered a &quot;[[Cryptozoology|cryptid]]&quot; (a hypothesized animal for which there is no scientific proof of existence in the wild).

| valign=&quot;top&quot; | Until recently, this bear was considered a separate subspecies. Today, it is considered to belong to the ''[[European brown bear|U. arctos arctos]]'' subspecies. Scientific evidence based on DNA studies would furthermore indicate the European brown bear can be divided into two distinct lineages. &quot;There is a clear division into two main mitochondrial lineages in modern European brown bear populations. These populations are divided into those carrying an eastern lineage (clade IIIa, Leonard et al. 2000), which is composed of Russian, northern Scandinavian and eastern European populations, and those carrying a western lineage (clade I, Leonard et al. 2000), which is composed of two subgroups, one believed to originate from the Iberian Peninsula, including southern Scandinavian bears and the Pyreneean populations; and the other from the Italian–Balkan peninsulas (Taberlet et al. 1994; see however Kohn et al. 1995). In addition, based on the subfossil record in northwestern Moldova and mitochondrial DNA data from modern populations, a Carpathian refuge has also been proposed (Sommer &amp; Benecke 2005; Saarma et al. 2007).&quot;&lt;ref name=j1&gt;{{cite pmid|18031475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brown bear is the largest animal on the [[Iberian Peninsula]], although one of the smallest of the brown bears, weigh between {{convert|130|and|180|kg|lb|abbr=on}} as adults. Their fur varies from a pale cream color to dark brown, but always with a distinctively darker, nearly black tone at the paws and a yellowish tinge at the tip of each hair. The brown bear population is considered [[Endangered species|endangered]] in Spain.

The brown bear population in the [[Pyrenees]] stems mostly from bears reintroduced from [[Slovenia]], with one or two remaining original males.&lt;ref name=&quot;La recuperació del rei dels boscos&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=j1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100213064125/http://www.fundacionosopardo.org/ficha.cfm?idArticulo=151 Cuántos osos hay y dónde viven].

==Physical description==
[[File:Bearclaw2.jpg|thumb|left|Brown bear claws are longer and less curved than those of black bears]]
[[File:Bear skull.jpg|thumb|left|Brown bear skull]]
Brown bears have long, thick fur, with a moderately long mane at the back of the neck. In India, brown bears can be reddish with silver tips, while in China, brown bears are bicolored with a yellow-brown or whitish cape across the shoulders. North American grizzlies can be dark brown (almost black) to cream (almost white) or yellowish brown. Black hairs usually have white tips.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; The winter fur is very thick and long, especially in northern subspecies, and can reach {{Convert|11|to|12|cm|in|sigfig=1}} at the [[withers]]. The winter hairs are thin, yet rough to the touch. The summer fur is much shorter and sparser, and its length and density varies geographically.&lt;ref name=&quot;soviet&quot;/&gt;

Brown bears have very large and curved claws, those present on the forelimbs being longer than those on the hind limbs. They may reach {{Convert|5|to|6|cm|in|sigfig=2}} and sometimes {{Convert|7|to|10|cm|in|sigfig=2}} along the curve.&lt;ref name=&quot;soviet&quot;&gt;[[#Heptner|Heptner]], &quot;Sirenia and carnivora (Sea cows; Wolves and Bears)&quot;,&lt;/ref&gt; They are generally dark with a light tip, with some forms having completely light claws.&lt;ref name=&quot;soviet&quot;/&gt; Brown bear claws are longer and straighter than those of American black bears.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;&gt;''Bear Anatomy and Physiology'' from Gary Brown's ''The Great Bear Almanac'', Lyons &amp; Burford, Publishers, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The claws are blunt, while those of a black bear are sharp. Due to their claw structure, in addition to their excessive weight, adult brown bears cannot climb trees as can both species of black bear. The paws of the brown bear are quite large. The rear feet of adult bears have been found to typically measure {{convert|21|to|36|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, with huge Kodiak bears having measured up to {{convert|46|cm|in|abbr=on}} along their rear foot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Wood&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Wood, Gerald |url = | title =The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats| year = 1983 | isbn = 978-0-85112-235-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adults have massive, heavily built [[wikt:concave|concave]] skulls, which are large in proportion to the body. The forehead is high and rises steeply.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; The projections of the skull are well developed when compared to those of [[Asian black bear]]s: the latter have [[sagittal crest]]s not exceeding more than 19–20% of the total length of the skull, while the former have sagittal crests comprising up to 40–41% of the skull's length. Skull projections are more weakly developed in females than in males. The [[braincase]] is relatively small and elongated. There is a great deal of geographical variation in the skull, and presents itself chiefly in dimensions.&lt;ref name=&quot;soviet&quot;/&gt; Grizzlies, for example, tend to have flatter profiles than European and coastal American brown bears.&lt;ref name=&quot;living&quot;/&gt; Skull lengths of Russian bears tend to be {{Convert|31.5|to|45.5|cm|in|sigfig=3}} for males, and {{Convert|27.5|to|39.7|cm|in|sigfig=3}} for females. The width of the [[zygomatic arch]]es in males is {{Convert|17.5|to|27.7|cm|in|sigfig=2}}, and {{Convert|14.7|to|24.7|cm|in|sigfig=2}} in females.&lt;ref name=&quot;soviet&quot;/&gt; Brown bears have very strong teeth: the [[incisors]] are relatively big and the [[canine teeth]] are large, the lower ones being strongly curved. The first three molars of the upper jaw are underdeveloped and single crowned with one root. The second upper molar is smaller than the others, and is usually absent in adults. It is usually lost at an early age, leaving no trace of the alveolus in the jaw. The first three molars of the lower jaw are very weak, and are often lost at an early age.&lt;ref name=&quot;soviet&quot;/&gt; Although they have powerful jaws, brown bear jaws are incapable of breaking large bones with the ease of [[spotted hyena]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ecmjournal.org/journal/smi/pdf/smi99-37.pdf|title=Enamel microstructural specialization in the canine of the spotted hyena, ''Crocuta crocuta''|author=John M.

===Body size===
The brown bear is the most variably sized of extant bear species. The dimensions of brown bears fluctuate very greatly according to sex, age, individual, geographic location, and season. The normal range of physical dimensions for a brown bear is a head-and-body length of {{convert|1.4|to|2.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} and a shoulder height of {{convert|70|to|153|cm|in|abbr=on}}. Males are invariably larger than females, typically weighing around 30% more in most races. The tail is relatively short, ranging from {{convert|6|to|22|cm|in|abbr=on}} in length.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zoo.org/animal-facts/brownbear Brown bear]. zoo.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Young of the year typically weigh {{convert|2|-|27|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, while yearlings typically weigh {{convert|9|-|37|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt;

Generally speaking, brown bears weigh the least when they emerge from hibernation in the spring and then reach peak weights when preparing for hibernation in the fall (when they often gorge on large food stuffs).&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt; Some subspecies show considerable variation. Whereas [[Eurasian brown bear]] (''U. a. arctos'') and [[grizzly bear]]s (''U. a. horribilis'') from Northern Europe, [[Yellowstone National Park]] or interior [[Alaska]] seasonally weigh on average between {{convert|115|and|360|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, bears from the [[Yukon Delta]], interior [[British Columbia]], [[Jasper National Park]] and southern Europe can weigh from {{convert|55|to|155|kg|lb|abbr=on}} on average.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brown Grizzly or Brown Bear (Ursus arctos)|url=http://www.nsrl.ttu.edu/tmot1/ursuarct.htm|publisher=Mammals of Texas- Online Edition |accessdate=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bears from the [[Syria]]n (''U. a. syriacus'') and the [[Gobi Desert]] (''U. a. gobiensis'') subspecies are around the same mass as the smaller Eurasian brown and grizzly bears and can exceptionally measure as small as {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} in head-and-body length.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt; On the other end of the scale among interior brown bears, exceptional grizzly, Eurasian brown bears, and [[East Siberian brown bear]]s (''U. a. collaris'') have been weighed up to {{convert|680|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, {{convert|481|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and {{convert|600|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, respectively.&lt;ref name = &quot;Wood&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Wood, Gerald |title =The Guinness Book of Animal Facts and Feats| year = 1983 | page = 256 | isbn = 978-0-85112-235-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the lack of genetic variation within subspecies, the environmental conditions in a given area likely plays the largest part in such weight variations.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt; Interior brown bears are generally smaller than is often perceived, being around the same weight as an average [[African lion]] at an estimate average of {{convert|180|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in males and {{convert|135|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ursus arctos- Brown Bear species|url=http://wildpro.twycrosszoo.org/S/0MCarnivor/ursidae/ursus/Ursus_arctos/Ursus_arctos.htm#Measurement|publisher=Wildpro |accessdate=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest inland brown bear subspecies appears to be the [[Ussuri brown bear]] (''U. a. lasiotus''), likely the ancestor of the modern-day American grizzly, which can obtain sizes comparable to those of the coastal bears as described below.&lt;ref name=&quot;soviet&quot;/&gt;

The brown bears found in coastal regions of Alaska and far eastern Russia are the largest. The largest subspecies is the [[Kodiak bear]] (''U. a. middendorffi''), followed closely by the [[Kamchatka brown bear]] (''U. a. beringianus''), although bears from other coastal regions of eastern Asia and western North America can be comparably large. In these areas, the female averages from {{convert|181.4|to|318|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and the male averages from {{convert|272|to|635|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt;&lt;ref name= FWS/&gt; The heaviest verified Kodiak bear weighed about 748&amp;nbsp;kg (1,650&amp;nbsp;lb).&lt;ref&gt;Busch, Robert H.

ISBN 1-59228-320-9.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not unusual for Kodiak bear males to weigh up to {{convert|680|kg|lb|abbr=on}} in fall with some specimens attaining {{convert|780|kg|lb|abbr=on}} or more.&lt;ref name= Macdonald&gt;{{cite book|year=1993|title=Mammals of Europe|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=New Jersey|page=107|isbn=0-691-09160-9|author=Macdonald, D.W.; Barrett, P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification needed|date=January 2013}} Such huge males can stand over {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=0}} tall while on their hind legs and loom {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} high at the shoulder.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheet&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wildlife.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=bears.trivia |publisher=Alaska Department of Fish and Game, Division of Wildlife Conservation |year=2008 |title=Kodiak Bear Fact Sheet |accessdate=2008-10-27|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100320140013/http://www.wildlife.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=bears.trivia|archivedate=2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heaviest recorded brown bear weighed over {{convert|1150|kg|lb|sigfig=2}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt;{{verification needed|date=January 2013}} Furthermore, a maximum weight of {{convert|1500|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for the Kodiak bear was published.&lt;ref name= Macdonald/&gt;{{verification needed|date=January 2013}}

==Distribution and habitat==
[[File:Brown bear seaguls.jpg|left|thumb|Brown bear at Brooks Falls]]
Brown bears were once native to much of Asia, the [[Atlas Mountains]] of Africa, Europe, and North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4003325.stm |title=Ancient bear made early migration |work=[[BBC News]] |date=November 12, 2004 |accessdate=January 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are now [[extinct]] in some areas, and their populations have greatly decreased in other areas. There are approximately 200,000 brown bears left in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown Bear | Species | WWF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Brown Bear {{!}} Species {{!}} WWF|url=http://worldwildlife.org/species/brown-bear|publisher=WWF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest populations are in Russia with 120,000,&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown Bear&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Brown Bear|url=http://www.rollinghillswildlife.com/animals/b/bearbrown/|publisher=Rolling Hills Wildlife Adventure}}&lt;/ref&gt; the United States with 32,500, and [[Canada]] with around 25,000. About 95% of the brown bear population in the United States is in Alaska, though in the lower 48 states, they are repopulating slowly but steadily along the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] and the western [[Great Plains]]. Although many people hold the belief some brown bears may be present in [[Mexico]] and the [[Atlas Mountains]] of [[Morocco]], both are almost certainly extinct. The last Mexican grizzly bear was shot in 1960. In [[Europe]], there are 14,000&amp;nbsp;brown bears in ten fragmented populations, from [[Spain]] (estimated at only 20–25 animals in the [[Pyrenees]] in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.elperiodico.cat/ca/noticias/societat/20100802/neixen-quatre-cries-dos-bru-als-pirineus/416750.shtml|date=2 August 2010|work=elperiodico.cat | title = Neixen quatre cries d'ós bru als Pirineus | accessdate = 2010-11-19 | language = Catalan; [[Spanish language|Spanish]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ecologistasenaccion.org/article17611.html|date=May 2010|work=ecologistasenaccion.org | title = Situació preocupant de l'ós bru als Pirineus | accessdate = 2010-11-19 | language = Catalan}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a range shared between [[France]], [[Spain]] and [[Andorra]], and some 210 animals in [[Asturias]], [[Cantabria]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] and [[Province of León|León]], in the [[Picos de Europa]] and adjacent areas in 2013 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.abc.es/sociedad/20130929/abci-osos-desafio-poblacion-creciente-201309281954.html |work= Abc.es | title = Osos, el desafío de una población creciente| language = Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the west, to [[Russia]] in the east, and from [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]] in the north to [[Romania]] (4000–5000), [[Bulgaria]] (900–1200), [[Slovakia]] (with about 600–800 animals), [[Slovenia]] (500–700 animals) and [[Greece]] (with about 200 animals) in the south. They are extinct in the [[British Isles]], extremely threatened in [[France]] and [[Spain]], and in trouble over most of [[Central Europe]]. The Carpathian brown bear population of [[Romania]] is the largest in Europe outside Russia, estimated at 4,500 to 5,000 bears, although declining alarmingly due to overhunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://proaction.tripod.com/localcampaigns/id26.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20040324084408/http://proaction.tripod.com/localcampaigns/id26.html | archivedate = 2004-03-24 | title = Proact Local Campaigns: Carpathian Brown Bear | accessdate = 2010-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a smaller brown bear population in the Carpathian Mountains in [[Ukraine]] (estimated at about 200 in 2005), [[Slovakia]] and [[Poland]] (estimated at about 100 in 2009 in the latter country).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://carpathianbear.pl/en/projects/management-plan | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110813050707/http://carpathianbear.pl/en/projects/management-plan | archivedate = 2011-08-13 | title = Carpathian Brown Bear Management Plan [in Poland]|work=carpathianbear.pl| accessdate = 2010-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The total Carpathian population is estimated at about 8,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/species/profiles/mammals/brown_bear2/brownbear_population_distribution/|work=wwf.panda.org | title = Brown Bear – Population &amp; Distribution: A Truly International Species| accessdate = 2010-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Northern Europe]] is home to a large bear population, with an estimated 2,500 (range 2,350–2,900) in [[Sweden]], about 1,600 in [[Finland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.suurpedot.fi/www/fi/lajit/karhu/index.php |work=suurpedot.fi| title = Karhu | accessdate = 2010-10-22 | language = finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 700 in [[Estonia]] and 70 in [[Norway]]. Another large and relatively stable population of brown bears in Europe, consisting of 2,500–3,000 individuals, is the Dinaric-Pindos (Balkans) population, with contiguous distribution in northeast [[Italy]], [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonia]], [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kora.ch/sp-ois/bear-ois/index.htm Bear Online Information System for Europe]. Kora.ch. Retrieved 2011-09-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown bears live in [[Alaska]], east through the Yukon and [[Northwest Territories]], south through [[British Columbia]] and through the western half of [[Alberta]]. The Alaskan population is estimated at a healthy 32,000 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brown Bear Research in Alaska|url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=wildlifenews.view_article&amp;articles_id=551|publisher=Alaska Department of Fish and Game|accessdate=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small populations exist in the [[Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem]] of northwest [[Wyoming]] (with about 600 animals), the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem of northwest [[Montana]] (with about 750 animals), the Cabinet-Yaak Ecosystem of northwest Montana and northeast [[Idaho]] (with about 30–40 animals), the Selkirk Ecosystem of northeast [[Washington state|Washington]] and northwest Idaho (with about 40–50 animals), and the North Cascades Ecosystem of northcentral Washington (with about 5–10 animals). These five ecosystems combine for a total of roughly 1,470 wild grizzlies still persisting in the contiguous United States. Unfortunately, these populations are isolated from each other, inhibiting any genetic flow between ecosystems. This poses one of the greatest threats to the future survival of the grizzly bear in the contiguous United States.

In Asia, brown bears are found primarily throughout [[Russia]], thence more spottily southwest to parts of the [[Middle East]], to as far south as southwestern [[Iran]], and to the southeast in a small area of [[Northeast China]], [[Western China]], and parts of [[North Korea]], [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[India]]. They can also be found on the [[Japan]]ese island of [[Hokkaidō]], which holds the largest number of non-Russian brown bears in eastern Asia with about 2,000–3,000 animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;&gt;''Carnivores of the World'' by Dr. Luke Hunter. Princeton University Press (2011), ISBN 9780691152288&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of brown bears in the [[Pyrenees]] mountain range between [[France]] and [[Spain]] is extremely low, estimated at 14 to 18, with a shortage of females. Their rarity in this area has led biologists to release bears, mostly female, from [[Slovenia]] in spring 2006 to reduce the imbalance and preserve the species' presence in the area. The bears were released despite protests from French farmers. A small population of brown bears (''[[Ursus arctos marsicanus]]'') still lives in central Italy ([[Apennine Mountains]], [[Abruzzo]] and [[Latium]]), with no more than 70 individuals, protected by strong laws, but endangered by the human presence in the area.

In [[Arctic]] areas, the potential habitat of the brown bear is increasing. The [[global warming|warming of that region]] has allowed the species to move farther north into what was once exclusively the domain of the [[polar bear]]. In non-Arctic areas, habitat loss is blamed as the leading cause of endangerment, followed by hunting.

This species inhabits the broadest range of habitats of any living bear species.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt;
They seem to have no altitudinal preferences and have been recorded from sea-level to an elevation of {{convert|5000|m|ft|abbr=on}} (the latter in the [[Himalayas]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; In most of their range, brown bears generally seems to prefer semiopen country, with a scattering of vegetation that can allow them a resting spot during the day. However, they have been recorded as inhabiting every variety of northern [[temperate forest]] known to occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; North American brown bears, or [[grizzly bears]], generally seem to prefer open or semi-open landscapes, with the species once having been common on the [[Great Plain]]s and continues to occur in sizeable numbers in [[tundra]] and [[Estuary|coastal estuaries]] and [[island]]s. Variable numbers still occur in [[prairie]] areas of the northern [[Rocky Mountains]] (mostly in Canada but some in the contiguous United States).&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; In western Eurasia, they inhabit mostly mountainous woodlands, in ranges such as the [[Alps]], the [[Pyrenees]] and the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], though they may have been driven into more wooded, precipitous habitats due to the prior extensive persecution of the species in some regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;mari&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name= Macdonald/&gt; Desolate parts of northern and eastern Europe, like large patches of [[Scandinavia]] and the [[Carpathian Mountains]], have always been quite heavily forested and have maintained relatively stable populations of bears, indicating that the brown bears here are well-adapted to forest-dwelling.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; In [[Central Asia]], human disturbances are minimal as this area has a harsher environment and is more sparsely populated. In this part of the world, bears may be found in [[steppe]], [[Alpine tundra|alpine meadows]] and even [[desert|desert edge]]. In [[Siberia]], the species seems well-adapted to living in denser [[Taiga|pine forests]]. Eastern Russian forests hold arguably the largest number of brown bears in the world outside of possibly Alaska and northeastern Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; It is thought the Eurasian bears which colonized America were [[tundra]]-adapted and the species is sometimes found around sub-Arctic [[ice field]]s. This is indicated by brown bears in the [[Chukotka Peninsula]] on the Asian side of Bering Strait, which are the only Asian brown bears to live year-round in lowland tundra like their North American cousins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.russianbearhunt.com/ |title=Brown Bear Hunting in Russia |publisher=Russianbearhunt.com |accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavior==
Although the brown bear is primarily [[nocturnal]], it is frequently seen in morning and early evening hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown / Grizzly Bear Facts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Brown / Grizzly Bear Facts|url=http://www.bear.org/website/bear-pages/brown-or-grizzly-bear/68-brown-grizzly-bear-facts.html|publisher=North American Bear Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summer through autumn, it can double its weight, gaining up to {{Convert|180|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of [[fat]], on which it relies to make it through winter, when it becomes very lethargic. Although they are not full [[hibernation|hibernators]] and can be woken easily, both sexes like to [[maternity den|den]] in a protected spot, such as a [[cave]], crevice, or hollow log, during the winter months. Brown bears are mostly solitary, although they may gather in large numbers at major food sources (e.g., [[moth]] colonies, open garbage dumps or rivers holding spawning [[salmon]]) and form social hierarchies based on age and size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Egbert | first1 = Allan L. | last2 = Stokes | first2 = Allen W. | year = 1974 | title = The social behaviour of brown bears on an Alaskan salmon stream | url =http://www.bearbiology.com/fileadmin/tpl/Downloads/URSUS/Vol_3/Egbert_Stokes_Egbert_Vol_3.pdf | format=PDF | journal = International Conference Bear Res. and Manage | volume = 3 | pages = 41–56 | jstor=3872753 | last3 = Egbert | first3 = A. L. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Adult male bears are particularly aggressive and are avoided by adolescent and subadult males. Female bears with cubs rival adult males in aggression, and are more intolerant of other bears than single females. Young adolescent males tend to be least aggressive, and have been observed in nonantagonistic interactions with each other. [[Dominance (ethology)|Dominance]] between bears is asserted by making a frontal orientation, showing off canines, muzzle twisting and neck stretching to which a subordinate will respond with a lateral orientation, by turning away and dropping the head and by sitting or lying down.&lt;ref&gt;Stonorov, Derek and Stokes, Allen W. (1972) [http://www.bearbiology.com/fileadmin/tpl/Downloads/URSUS/Vol_2/Stonorov_Stokes.pdf &quot;Social Behavior of the Alaska Brown Bear&quot;] ''Panel 4: Bear Behaviour''&lt;/ref&gt; During combat, bears use their paws to strike their opponents in the chest or shoulders and bite the head or neck. In his ''Great Bear Almanac'', Gary Brown lists 11 different sounds bears produce in 9 different contexts. Sounds expressing anger or aggravation include growls, roars, woofs, champs and smacks, while sounds expressing nervousness or pain include woofs, grunts, and bawls. Sows will bleat or hum when communicating with their cubs.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt;

===Home ranges===
Brown bears usually occur over vast home ranges, however they are not highly territorial. Several adult bears often roam freely over the same vicinity without issue unless rights to a fertile female or food sources are being contested. Males always cover more area than females each year and will try to mate with as many females as they can (although females are not monogamous either). In areas where food is abundant and concentrated, such as coastal Alaska, home ranges for females are up to {{convert|24|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and for males are up to {{convert|89|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Similarly, in [[British Columbia]], bears of the two sexes travel relatively compact home ranges of {{convert|115|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|318|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. In [[Yellowstone National Park]], home ranges for females are up to {{convert|281|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and up to {{convert|874|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} for males. In the central Arctic of Canada, where food sources are quite sparse, home ranges range up to {{convert|2434|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in females and {{convert|8171|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in males.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt;

A study of male-inherited [[Y chromosome]] [[DNA]] sequence found that brown bears, over the past few 10,000 years, have shown strong [[male-biased dispersal]]&lt;ref&gt;Tobias Bidon, Axel Janke, Steven R Fain, Hans-Geir Eiken, Snorre B Hagen, Urmas Saarma, Björn M Hallström, Nicolas Lecomte, Frank Hailer (2014) Brown and polar bear Y chromosomes reveal extensive male-biased gene flow within brother lineages. Molecular Biology and Evolution 31 (6): 1353-1363. ({{doi|10.1093/molbev/msu109}}).&lt;/ref&gt; That study found surprisingly similar Y chromosomes in brown bear populations as far apart as Norway and coastal Alaska, indicating extensive [[gene flow]] across [[Eurasia]] and [[North America]]. Notably, this contrasts with genetic signals from female-inherited [[mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA), where brown bears of different geographic regions typically show strong differences in their mtDNA, a result of female [[philopatry]].

===Reproduction===
The [[mating season]] is from mid-May to early July.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; Being [[serially monogamous]], brown bears remain with the same mate from several days to a couple of weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bear-hunting.org/types-of-bears/ Types of Bears] – Information on Specific Bear Species (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Females mature sexually between the age of 4 and 8 years of age, while males first mate about a year later on average, when they are large and strong enough to successfully compete with other males for mating rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Ähtärin karhut 24.jpg|thumb|left|Pair of mating brown bears, at [[Ähtäri Zoo]] in [[Ähtäri|Ähtäri, Finland]]]] Males, however, take no part in raising their cubs – parenting is left entirely to the females.

Through the process of [[delayed implantation]], a female's fertilized egg divides and floats freely in the uterus for six months. During winter dormancy, the fetus attaches to the [[uterus|uterine]] wall. The cubs are born eight weeks later, while the mother sleeps. If the mother does not gain enough weight to survive through the winter, the embryo does not implant and is reabsorbed into the body. The average litter has one to four cubs, usually two. There have been cases of bears with as many as six cubs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; There are records of females sometimes adopting stray cubs or even trading cubs when they emerge from hibernation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; Older females tend to give birth to larger litters. The size of a litter also depends on factors such as geographic location and food supply. At birth, the cubs are blind, toothless, hairless, and weigh less than {{Convert|450|g|lb|sigfig=1}}. They feed on their mother's milk until spring or even early summer, depending on climate conditions. At this time, the cubs weigh {{Convert|7|to|9|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and have developed enough to follow her and begin to forage for solid food.

Cubs remain with their mother from two to four years (exceptionally to 4 and a half years), during which time they learn survival techniques, such as which foods have the highest nutritional value and where to obtain them; how to hunt, fish, and defend themselves; and where to den. The cubs learn by following and imitating their mother's actions during the period they are with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shadowofthebear.com/reproduction.html |title=Brown Bear Reproduction |publisher=Shadowofthebear.com |accessdate=2009-10-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080501092730/http://www.shadowofthebear.com/reproduction.html |archivedate = May 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown bears practice [[infanticide (zoology)|infanticide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1439-0310.2006.01152.x | title = Mating Strategies in Relation to Sexually Selected Infanticide in a Non-Social Carnivore: The Brown Bear | year = 2006 | last1 = Bellemain | first1 = Eva | last2 = Swenson | first2 = Jon E. | last3 = Taberlet | first3 = Pierre | journal = Ethology | volume = 112 | issue = 3 | pages = 238–246 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An adult male bear may kill the cubs of another bear either to make the female sexually receptive or simply for consumption. Cubs flee up a tree when they see a strange male bear, and the mother often successfully defends them, even though the male may be twice as heavy as she.

===Longevity===
The brown bear is naturally a long-living animal. Wild females have been known to be able to reproduce at as old as 28 years of age, the oldest known age for reproduction in the wild of any ursid.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; Males commonly can live to 25 years, with the oldest female having been 37 years old. The species can live to 48 years of age in captivity. Annual mortality for bears of any age is estimated at around 10% in most protected areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; However, in hunted populations, an estimated average mortality rate of 38% is given.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; Around 13% to 44% of cubs die within their first year. Beyond predation by other large predators (rarely by [[Gray wolf|gray wolf packs]] or [[Siberian tiger]]s) and brown bears, starvation and accidents claim a few cubs. Even in populations living in protected areas without legal, non-governmental hunting, though, humans are still the leading cause of mortality for brown bears.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown Bear Hunting Alaska&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Brown/Grizzly Bear Hunting in Alaska|url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=brownbearhunting.main|publisher=Alaska Department of Fish and Game}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest number of legally hunting on the species occurs in [[Canada]], [[Finland]], [[Russia]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Alaska]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt;

===Dietary habits===
[[File:Brown Bear Feeding on Salmon.jpg|thumb|upright|Brown bear feeding on [[salmon]]]]
The Brown Bear is one of the most [[omnivorous]] animals in the world and has been recorded as consuming the greatest variety of foods of any bear.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; Throughout life, this species is regularly curious about the potential of eating virtually any organism or object that they encounter. Food that is both abundant and easily accessed or caught is preferred. Their jaw structure has evolved to fit their dietary habits. Their diet varies enormously throughout their differing areas based on opportunity.

Despite their reputation, most brown bears are not highly carnivorous, as they derive up to 90% of their dietary [[food energy]] from vegetable matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dced.state.ak.us/oed/student_info/learn/bearwatching.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090415202025/http://www.dced.state.ak.us/oed/student_info/learn/bearwatching.htm |archivedate=2009-04-15 |title=Alaska is bear territory!|work=Alaska Office of Economic Development |publisher=Dced.state.ak.us |accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; They often feed on a variety of plant life, including [[berries]], [[grass]]es, [[flower]]s, [[acorn]]s and [[pine cone]]s as well as [[fungi]] such as [[mushroom]]s.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt; Among all bears, brown bears are uniquely equipped to dig for tough foods such as [[root]]s and [[shoot]]s. They use their long, strong claws to dig out earth to reach the roots and their powerful jaws to bite through them.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt; In spring, winter-provided carrion, grasses, shoots, sedges and forbs are the dietary mainstays for brown bears internationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; Fruits, including berries, become increasingly important during summer and early autumn. Roots and bulbs become critical in autumn for some inland bear populations if fruit crops are poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunter&quot;/&gt; They will also commonly consume animal matter, which in summer and autumn may regularly be in the form of [[insect]]s, [[larvae]] and [[Larva|grubs]], including [[beehive]]s. Bears in Yellowstone eat an enormous number of [[moth]]s during the summer, sometimes as many as 40,000 [[Army cutworm|army cutworm moths]] in a single day, and may derive up to half of their annual food energy from these insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yellowstonepark.com/MoreToKnow/ShowNewsDetails.aspx?newsid=163 |title=Yellowstone Grizzly Bears Eat 40,000 Moths a Day In August |publisher=Yellowstonepark.com |accessdate=2009-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown bears living near coastal regions will regularly eat [[crab]]s and [[clam]]s. In Alaska, bears along the beaches of estuaries regularly dig through the sand for clams.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; This species may eat [[bird]]s and their [[Egg (biology)|egg]]s, including almost entirely ground- or rock-nesting species.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt;  The diet may be supplemented by [[rodent]]s or similar smallish [[mammal]]s, including [[marmot]]s, [[ground squirrel]]s, [[Mouse|mice]], [[rat]]s, [[lemming]]s and [[vole]]s.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt;  With particular regularity, bears in [[Denali National Park]] will wait at burrows of [[Arctic ground squirrel]]s hoping to pick off a few of the {{convert|1|kg|lb|abbr=on}} rodents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weaselwords.com/page/ferret_art036.php|title=Inherited behavior traits of the domesticated ferret|last=Brown|first=Susan, A|work=weaselwords.com|accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Kamchatka peninsula and several parts of coastal Alaska, brown bears feed mostly on spawning [[salmon]], whose nutrition and abundance explain the enormous size of the bears in these areas. The fishing techniques of bears are well-documented. They often congregate around falls when the salmon are forced to breach the water, at which point the bears will try to catch the fish in mid-air (often with their mouths). They will also wade into shallow waters, hoping to pin a slippery salmon with their claws. While they may eat almost all the parts of the fish, bears at the peak of spawning, when there is usually a glut of fish to feed on, may eat only the most nutrious parts of the salmon (including the eggs and head) and then indifferently leave the rest of the carcass to scavengers, which can include [[red fox]]es, [[bald eagle]]s, [[common raven]]s and [[gull]]s. Despite their normally solitary habits, Brown bears will gather rather closely in numbers at good spawning sites. The largest and most powerful males claim the most fruitful fishing spots and bears (especially males) will sometimes fight over the rights to a prime fishing spot.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt;

Beyond the regular predation of salmon, most brown bears are not particularly active predators.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; While perhaps a majority of bears of the species will charge at large prey at one point in their lives and most eat carrion, many predation attempts start with the bear clumsily and half-heartedly pursuing the prey and end with the prey escaping alive.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; On the other hand, some brown bears are quite self-assured predators who habitually pursue and catch large prey items. Such bears are usually taught how to hunt by their mothers from an early age.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; Large mammals preyed on can include various [[deer]] species such as [[elk]], [[red deer]], [[axis deer]], [[roe deer|European roe deer]], [[Siberian roe deer]], [[fallow deer]], [[mule deer]], [[white tailed deer]], [[moose]] and [[Caribou (North America)|caribou]]. [[Bovid]]s are also regular prey including various [[ovis|sheep]], [[capra (genus)|goat]]s, [[antelope]], [[bison]] and [[muskoxen]], as are [[wild boar]]s.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt; When brown bears attack these large animals, they usually target young or infirm ones, as they are easier to catch. Typically when hunting (especially with young prey), the bear pins its prey to the ground and then immediately tears and eats it alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=French |first1= S. P. |last2= French |first2=M. G. |title=Predatory behavior of grizzly bears feeding on elk calves in Yellowstone National Park, 1986–1988 |year= 1990 |journal=International Conf.

Brown bears may also ambush young animals by finding them via scent.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt; When emerging from hibernation, brown bears, whose broad paws allow them to walk over most ice and snow, may pursue large prey such as moose whose hooves cannot support them on encrusted snow.&lt;ref name= Macdonald/&gt; Similarly, predatory attacks on large prey sometimes occur at riverbeds, when it is more difficult for the prey specimen to run away due to muddy or slippery soil.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt; On rare occasions, while confronting fully-grown, dangerous prey, bears kill them by hitting with their powerful forearms, which can break the necks and backs of large creatures such as adult moose and adult bison.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; They also feed on [[carrion]], and use their size to intimidate other predators, such as [[wolf|wolves]], [[cougar]]s, [[tiger]]s, and [[American black bear|black bear]]s from their kills. Carrion is especially important in the early spring (when the bears are emerging from hibernation), much of it comprised by winter-killed big game.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt; Cannibalism is not unheard of, though predation is not normally believed to be the primary motivation when brown bears attack each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt;

When forced to live in close proximity with humans and their domesticated animals, bears may potentially predate any type of domestic animal. Among these, domestic [[cattle]] are sometimes exploited as prey. Cattle are bitten on the neck, back or head and then the abdominal cavity is opened for eating.&lt;ref name= Smith/&gt; Plants and fruit farmed by humans are readily consumed as well, including [[Maize|corn]], [[wheat]], [[sorghum]], [[melon]]s and any form of [[Berry|berries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; They will also feed at domestic [[Beekeeping|bee farms]], readily consuming both honey and the contents of the [[honey bee]] colony.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; Human foods and trash or refuse is eaten when possible. When an open garbage dump was kept in Yellowstone, brown bears were one of the most voracious and regular scavengers. The dump was closed after both brown and American black bears came to associate humans with food and lost their natural fear of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt;

Brown bears regularly intimidate [[wolf|wolves]] away from their kills. In [[Yellowstone National Park]], brown bears pirate wolf kills so often, Yellowstone's Wolf Project director Doug Smith wrote, &quot;It's not a matter of if the bears will come calling after a kill, but when.&quot; Despite the high animosity between the two species, most confrontations at kill sites or large carcasses end without bloodshed on either side.

Brown bears usually dominate other bear species in areas where they coexist. Due to their smaller size, [[American black bear]]s are at a competitive disadvantage to brown bears in open, unforested areas. Although displacement of black bears by brown bears has been documented, actual interspecific killing of black bears by brown bears has only occasionally been reported. Confrontation is mostly avoided due to the black bear's diurnal habits and preference for heavily forested areas, as opposed to the brown bear's largely nocturnal habits and preference for open spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nps.gov/yell/naturescience/upload/predation.pdf|format=PDF |title=Probable grizzly bear predation on an American black bear in Yellowstone National Park |author=Gunther, Kerry A.; Biel, Mark J.; Anderson, Neil and Watts, Lisette |year=2002 |journal=[[Ursus (journal)|Ursus]] |volume=13 |pages=372–374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown bears may also kill [[Asian black bear]]s, though the latter species probably largely avoids conflicts with the Brown bear due to similar habits and habitat preferences to the American Black species.&lt;ref name=&quot;denning&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.bearbiology.com/fileadmin/tpl/Downloads/URSUS/Vol_14_2/Seryodkin_14_2.pdf |title=Denning ecology of brown bears and Asiatic black bears in the Russian Far East|jstor=3873015|author=Seryodkin, Ivan V.|journal=Ursus|volume=14|issue= 2 |year=2003|pages=153–161|last2=Kostyria|first2=A.

===Conflicts between bears and humans===
Bears become attracted to human-created food sources, such as garbage dumps, litter bins, and dumpsters; they venture into human dwellings or [[barn]]s in search of food as humans encroach into bear habitats. In the U.S., bears sometimes kill and eat farm animals. When bears come to associate human activity with a &quot;food reward&quot;, they are likely to continue to become emboldened; the likelihood of human-bear encounters increases, as they may return to the same location despite relocation. The saying &quot;a fed bear is a dead bear&quot; has come into use to popularize the idea that allowing bears to scavenge human garbage, such as trash cans and campers' backpacks, [[pet food]], or other food sources that draw the bear into contact with humans, can result in a bear's death.

Relocation of the bear has been used to separate the bear from the human environment, but it does not address the problem of the bear's newly learned association of humans with food or the environmental situations which created the human-habituated bear. &quot;Placing a bear in habitat used by other bears may lead to competition and social conflict, and result in the injury or death of the less dominant bear.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bearsmart.com/managingBears/Relocation.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060513075036/http://www.bearsmart.com/managingBears/Relocation.html|archivedate=2006-05-13|title=Relocation|work=Get Bear Smart Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Yellowstone National Park]], a reserve located in the western United States, contains prime habitat for the grizzly bear (''Ursus arctos horribilis''), and due to the enormous number of visitors, human-bear encounters are common. The scenic beauty of the area has led to an influx of people moving into the area. In addition, because there are so many bear relocations to the same remote areas of Yellowstone, and because male bears tend to dominate the center of the relocation zone, female bears tend to be pushed to the boundaries of the region and beyond. As a result, a large proportion of repeat offenders, bears that are killed for public safety, are females. This creates a further depressive effect on an already endangered species. The grizzly bear is officially described as &quot;threatened&quot; in the U.S. Though the problem is most significant with regard to grizzlies, these issues affect the other types of brown bears as well.

In Europe, part of the problem lies with [[shepherd]]s; over the past two centuries, many sheep and goat herders have gradually abandoned the more traditional practice of using [[dog]]s to guard flocks, which have concurrently grown larger. Typically, they allow the herds to graze freely over sizeable tracts of land. As bears reclaim parts of their range, they may eat livestock. In some cases, the shepherds shoot the bear, thinking their livelihood is under threat. Many are now better informed about the ample compensation available, and will make a claim when they lose livestock to a bear.

It is likely that humans caused extinction of bear populations and fragmentation of their habitats since prehistorical time. It is, for instance, shown that bear populations from the [[Greater Caucasus]] and the [[Lesser Caucasus]] Mountains, separated by the densely populated Transcaucasian Depression, have been matrilineally isolated since the early Holocene era, i.e., after permanent human settlements appeared throughout the area&lt;ref name=&quot;mari&quot; /&gt;

===Relationship with Native Americans===

[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes sympatric with brown bears often viewed them with a mixture of awe and fear. North American brown bears were so feared by the natives, that they were rarely hunted, especially alone. When natives hunted grizzlies, the expedition was conducted with the same preparation and ceremoniality as intertribal warfare, and was never done except with a company of 4–10 warriors. The tribe members who dealt the killing blow were highly esteemed among their compatriots. Californian natives actively avoided prime bear habitat, and would not allow their young men to hunt alone, for fear of bear attacks. During the Spanish colonial period, some tribes, instead of hunting grizzlies themselves, would seek aid from European colonists to deal with problem bears. Many authors in the American west wrote of natives or voyagers with lacerated faces and missing noses or eyes due to attacks from grizzlies.&lt;ref name=&quot;geist&quot;&gt;Geist, Valerius (1989) [https://web.archive.org/web/20081216192502/http://www.cnr.uidaho.edu/wlf520/pdf/geist.pdf &quot;Did Large Predators keep Humans out of North America?&quot;], pp. 282–294 in Juliet Clutton-Brock (ed.) ''The Walking larder: patterns of domestication, pastoralism, and predation'', Unwin Hyman, ISBN 0044450133.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore|Sleeping Bear Dunes]] is named after a Native American legend, where a female bear and her cub swam across Lake Michigan.  Exhausted from their journey, the bears rested on the shoreline and fell sound asleep.  Over the years, the sand covered them up, creating a huge sand dune.

Many Native American tribes both respected and feared the brown bear, even thinking of it as a god.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.support-native-american-art.com/Native-American-Animal-Symbols-Bears.html Native American Animal Symbols – The Bear]. Support-native-american-art.com (2004-01-22).

===Bear encounters===
There are an average of two fatal attacks by bears per year in North America.&lt;ref&gt;Herrero, Stephen (2002) ''Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance'', revised edition, Lyons Press, ISBN 158574557X.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scandinavia]], there are only four known cases since 1902 of bear encounters which have resulted in death. The two most common causes for bear attack are surprise and curiosity.&lt;ref name=&quot;akscience&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.absc.usgs.gov/research/brownbears/attacks/bear-human_conflicts.htm |title=Ursus arctos californicus |accessdate=April 12, 2008 |author=Smith, Tom S. and Herrero, Steven |publisher=Alaska Science Center – Biological Science Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some types of bears, such as polar bears, are more likely to attack humans when searching for food, while [[American black bear]]s are much less likely to attack.

The Alaska Science Center ranks the following as the most likely reasons for bear attacks:&lt;ref name=&quot;akscience&quot; /&gt;
# Surprise
# Curiosity
# Invaded personal space (this includes a mother bear protecting her young)
# Predatory intent
# Hunting wounded
# Carcass defense
# Provoked charge

Aggressive behavior in brown bears is favored by numerous selection variables. Unlike the smaller black bears, adult brown bears are too large and have improperly shaped claws to escape danger by climbing trees, so they respond to danger by standing their ground and warding off their attackers. Increased aggressiveness also assists female brown bears in better ensuring the survival of their young to reproductive age.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050309215404/http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2004/04/04-27-04tdc/04-27-04dscihealth-column-01.asp Why are grizzly bears more aggressive than our black bears?].

===Attacks on humans===

Brown bears seldom attack humans on sight, and usually avoid people. They are, however, unpredictable in temperament, and may attack if they are surprised or feel threatened.&lt;ref name=&quot;attack&quot;&gt;Herrero, Stepehen (1985) ''Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance'', Hurtig Publishers Ltd./ Edmonton&lt;/ref&gt; Sows with cubs account for the majority of injuries and fatalities in North America. [[Habituation|Habituated]] or food-conditioned bears can also be dangerous, as their long-term exposure to humans causes them to lose their natural shyness, and, in some cases, to associate humans with food. Small parties of one or two people are more often attacked than large groups, with only one known case of an attack on a group of six or more. In that instance, it is thought that due to surprise, the bear may not have recognized the size of the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOLS 2011 bear attack&quot;&gt;[http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/alaska-bear-attack-nols-kids-did-phenomenal-job Alaska bear attack: NOLS kids did a 'phenomenal job'], Craig Medred, [[Alaska Dispatch]], 26 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In the majority of attacks resulting in injury, brown bears precede the attack with a growl or huffing sound,&lt;ref name=&quot;attack&quot;/&gt; In contrast to injuries caused by American black bears, which are usually minor, brown bear attacks tend to result in serious injury and, in some cases, death.&lt;ref name=&quot;attack&quot;/&gt; Brown bears seem to confront humans as they would when fighting other bears: they rise up on their hind legs, and attempt to &quot;disarm&quot; their victims by biting and holding on to the lower jaw to avoid being bitten in turn.&lt;ref name=&quot;geist&quot;/&gt; Due to the bears' enormous physical strength, even a single bite or swipe can be deadly, as in tigers, with some human victims having had their heads completely crushed by a bear bite.&lt;ref name=&quot;living&quot;&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/livinganimalsofw01cornrich#page/n7/mode/2up '&amp;#39;The living animals of the world; a popular natural history with one thousand illustrations'&amp;#39; Volume 1: Mammals], by [[Charles John Cornish|Cornish, C.

Retrieved 2011-09-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Most attacks occur in the months of July, August, and September, the time when the number of outdoor recreationalists, such as hikers or hunters, is higher. People who assert their presence through noises tend to be less vulnerable, as they alert bears to their presence. In direct confrontations, people who run are statistically more likely to be attacked than those who stand their ground. Violent encounters with brown bears usually last only a few minutes, though they can be prolonged if the victims fight back.&lt;ref name=&quot;attack&quot;/&gt;

Attacks on humans are considered extremely rare in the [[former Soviet Union]], though exceptions exist in districts where they are not pursued by hunters.&lt;ref name=&quot;soviet&quot;/&gt; Siberian bears, for example, tend to be much bolder toward humans than their shyer, more persecuted European counterparts. In 2008, a [[platinum]] mining compound in the Olyotorsky district of northern Kamchatka was besieged by a group of 30 bears, who killed two guards and prevented workers from leaving their homes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4387144.ece Bears besiege Russian mine after killing guards].

In Japan, a large brown bear nicknamed &quot;''Kesagake''&quot; (袈裟懸け, &quot;[[Kesa (clothing)|kesa]]-style slasher&quot;) made history for causing the [[Sankebetsu brown bear incident|worst bear attack in Japanese history]] at [[Tomamae, Hokkaidō]] during numerous encounters during December, 1915. It killed seven people (including one pregnant woman) and wounded three others (with possibly another three previous fatalities to its credit) before being gunned down after a large-scale beast-hunt. Today, there is still a shrine at Rokusensawa (六線沢), where the event took place, in memory of the victims of the incident.

Within Yellowstone National Park, injuries caused by grizzly attacks in developed areas averaged approximately one per year during the 1930s through to the 1950s, though it increased to four per year during the 1960s. They then decreased to one injury every two years during the 1970s. Between 1980 and 2002, there have been only two human injuries caused by grizzly bears in a developed area. Though grizzly attacks were rare in the backcountry before 1970, the number of attacks increased to an average of approximately one per year during the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yellowstone-bearman.com/yell_bear_maul_info.html Bear Caused Human Injuries and Deaths In Yellowstone National Park].

===History of defense from bears===
A study by US and Canadian researchers has found [[pepper spray]] to be more effective at stopping aggressive bear behavior than guns, working in 92% of studied incidents versus 67% for guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrying pepper spray is highly recommended by many authorities when traveling in bear country; however, carrying two means of deterrent, one of which is a large caliber gun, is also advised. Solid shotgun slugs, or three buckshot rounds, or a pistol of .44 caliber or more is suggested if a heavy hunting rifle is not available. Guns remain a viable, last resort option to be used in defense of life from aggressive bears.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith_brown_bear_projects&quot;&gt;{{cite web

According to the Alaska Science Center, a [[gauge (bore diameter)|12 gauge]] [[shotgun]] with [[slug (projectile)|slugs]] has been the most effective weapon. There have been fewer injuries as a result of only carrying lethal loads in the shotgun, as opposed to deterrent rounds. State of Alaska Defense of Life or Property (DLP) laws require one to report the kill to authorities, and salvage the hide, skull, and claws.&lt;ref name=&quot;casenumber_07-96958&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Campers are often told to wear bright colored red ribbons and bells, and carry whistles to ward off bears. They are told to look for grizzly scat in camping areas, and be careful to carry the bells and whistles in those areas. Grizzly scat is difficult to differentiate from black bear scat, as diet is in a constant state of flux depending on the availability of seasonal food items. If a bear is killed near camp, the bear's carcass must be adequately disposed of, including entrails and blood, if possible. Failure to move the carcass has often resulted in it attracting other bears and further exacerbating a bad situation. Moving camps immediately is another recommended method.

A page at the State of Alaska Department of Natural Resources website offers information about how to &quot;[http://dnr.alaska.gov/parks/safety/bears.htm select a gun that will stop a bear (12-gauge shotgun or .300 mag rifle)].&quot; This information is helpful for people venturing into &quot;bear country&quot;, regardless of state or country,

===Culture===
[[File:The Three Bears - Project Gutenberg etext 19993.jpg|thumb|upright|&quot;[[The Story of the Three Bears]]&quot;, illustration from ''Childhood's Favorites and Fairy Stories'']]
Brown bears often figure into the literature of Europe and North America, in particular that which is written for children. &quot;[[The Brown Bear of Norway]]&quot; is a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[fairy tale]] telling the adventures of a girl who married a prince magically turned into a bear, and who managed to get him back into a human form by the force of her love and after many trials and difficulties. With &quot;[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears]]&quot;, a story from England, the three bears are usually depicted as brown bears. In German speaking countries, children are often told the fairytale of [[Snow White and Rose Red]]; the handsome prince in this tale has been transfigured into a brown bear. In the United States, parents often read their preschool age children the book [[Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?]] to teach them their colors and how they are associated with different animals.

The [[Russian bear]] is a common [[national personification]] for [[Russia]] (as well as the former [[Soviet Union]]). The brown bear is also [[Finland]]'s national animal.

[[File:Berni Bayern.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Berni is a brown bear mascot of German football club [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]]]
The [[Bundesliga]] club [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] has a brown bear mascot named Berni.

The [[National Football League]] (NFL) franchise in Chicago, Illinois, is named the [[Chicago Bears|Bears]].  In this context, no differentiation between black and brown bears is needed.

The school mascot for [[George Fox University]], [[Brown University]], the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the [[University of California, Riverside]], and the [[University of Alberta]] is the brown bear.

The coat of arms of [[Madrid]] depicts a bear reaching up into a ''madroño'' or [[Arbutus unedo|strawberry tree]] (''Arbutus unedo'') to eat some of its fruit, whereas the Swiss city of [[Bern]]'s coat of arms also depicts a bear and the city's name is popularly thought to derive from the German word for bear.

In the town of [[Prats de Molló]], in [[Vallespir]], southern France, a &quot;bear festival&quot; (''festa de l'ós'') is celebrated annually at the beginning of spring, in which the locals dress up as bears, cover themselves with soot or coal and oil, and &quot;attack&quot; the onlookers, attempting to get everyone dirty. The festival ends with the ''ball de l'os'' (bear dance).

The [[grizzly bear]] is the state animal of [[Montana]].  The California golden bear is the state animal of [[California]]. Both animals are sub-species of the brown bear.
