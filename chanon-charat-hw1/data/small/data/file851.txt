'''Amyntas I''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Ἀμύντας Aʹ; c. 540 – 498 BC) was a king of [[Macedon]]. He was a son of [[Alcetas I of Macedon]]. He married Eurydice and they had a son [[Alexander I of Macedon|Alexander]].

Amyntas was a [[Tributary state|tributary]] [[vassal]] of [[Darius I]], king of the Persian Achaemenid Empire. 
The history of Macedon may be said to begin with Amyntas' reign. He was the first of its rulers to have diplomatic relations with other states.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}  
In particular, he entered into an alliance with [[Hippias (tyrant)|Hippias]] of [[Athens]], and when Hippias was driven out of Athens he offered him the territory of [[Anthemus (city)|Anthemus]] on the [[Thermaic Gulf]] with the object of taking advantage of the feuds between the Greeks.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} 
Hippias refused the offer and also rejected the offer of [[Iolcos]], as Amyntas probably did not control Anthemous at that time, but was merely suggesting a plan of joint occupation to Hippias.&lt;ref&gt;Miltiades V.
