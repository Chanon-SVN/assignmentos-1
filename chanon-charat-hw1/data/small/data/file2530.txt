'''BBC Red Button''' is a branding used for digital [[interactive television]] services provided by the [[BBC]], and broadcast in the United Kingdom.  The services replaced [[Ceefax]], the BBC's analogue [[teletext]] service, and is only available via digital television receivers.  The service can be accessed via [[Digital terrestrial television]] (DTT) ([[DVB-T]]), satellite television ([[DVB-S]]) and cable television ([[DVB-C]]).  The &quot;Red Button&quot; branding is no longer used within the BBC's own website.

==History and branding==
[[File:BBCi logo original.png|right|thumb|BBCi logo 2001–2004]]
[[File:BBCi.svg|129px|thumb|right|BBCi logo 2004–2008]]
The service was launched in September 1999 as BBC Text.  It was relaunched in November 2001 under the '''BBCi''' brand and operated under this name until late 2008, when it was rebranded as BBC Red Button.  The &quot;red button&quot; name refers to the common interface on [[remote control]]s for digital televisions and [[set-top box]]es, a red button, which launches digital teletext services.

Although initially marketed as a spectacular new form of television, by 2008 this had given way to positioning iTV as ‘everyday’. This was due in part to the institutional landscape of television in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bennett|first=James|title='Your Window-on-the-World' : The Emergence of Red-Button Interactive Television in the UK|journal=Convergence: The International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies|year=2008|volume=14|issue=2|page=161|doi=10.1177/1354856507087942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BBC Text (1999-2001)===
BBC Text originally launched on digital terrestrial services in September 1999, and was later introduced on satellite and cable platforms.  In the first phase, the service was created using content migrated from the existing analogue teletext service, Ceefax.  A digital text service had been available since the launch of digital terrestrial television in November 1998, but the BBC Text service was not publicly launched until November 1999, due to a lack of availability of compatible set-top boxes.
&lt;ref name=&quot;RDreview2000&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/pubs/annual-review/rev_00/bbcrdar00part3.pdf|title=Digital Broadcasting – BBC R&amp;D Annual Review 1999–2000|year=2000|publisher=BBC Research &amp; Development|pages=49–50|accessdate=13 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BBC Text was considerably more advanced than Ceefax, in that it offered a richer visual interface, with the possibility of photographic images and designed graphics (as opposed to Ceefax graphics which were composed of simple blocks of colour). BBC Text also enabled channel association, the ability for the user to retain their selected television channel visible in one section of the screen whilst viewing the text service, in contrast to Ceefax, which could only be viewed as a full-screen display, or as a semitransparent overlay (i.e. opaque blocks of colour on top of the television channel, with the black background now transparent; not 'translucent blocks of colour with a translucent black background') above the television picture. The original text service had no return path, this being made available in later phases.

BBC Text pioneered an early form of &quot;[[Video on demand|on-demand]]&quot; [[interactive television]], called Enhanced TV. During the [[1999 Wimbledon Championships]], the BBC presented a service which allowed viewers to select a video stream of different matches, and access additional information such as player profiles, scores and interactive quizzes. Although the experimental service was publicly available, there were no digital set-top boxes or receivers available on the market which could decode the signal and the service was only presented to the public via BBC demonstrations using prototype receivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;RDreview2000&quot;/&gt;

===The BBCi brand (2001-2008)===
[[File:BBCi-bar TV.jpg|thumb|right|200px|BBCi TV i-bar, 2001]]
[[File:Bbci website jan 2004.jpg|thumb|right|200px|BBCi website navbar, 2004]]
The BBCi brand launched in November 2001 and was conceived as a cohesive [[cross-platform|multi-platform]] brand name for all the BBC's digital interactive services, encompassing the corporation's digital teletext, interactive television and website services.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcsnews0711&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1643259.stm|title=BBCi heralds new interactive era|date=7 November 2001|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;whatisBBCi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/home/whatisbbci/|title=What is BBCi?|date=15 December 2002|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 October 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20011215000308/http://www.bbc.co.uk/home/whatisbbci/ |archivedate=15 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the BBC, the &quot;i&quot; in BBCi stood for &quot;interactivity&quot; as well as &quot;innovation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian1101&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2001/nov/12/mondaymediasection.bbc1|title=A fresh i for BBC|last=Gibson|first=Owen|date=12 November 2001|work=The Guardian |accessdate=2 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various services all took on a common interface device, an &quot;i-bar&quot; branded with the BBCi logo, which sought to emphasise the brand across different technologies by providing similar navigation.  For example, the [[BBC Online|BBC website]], which had previously been called BBC Online, took on the BBCi brand from 2001, displaying an i-bar across the top of every page, offering a category-based navigation: Categories, TV, Radio, Communicate, Where I Live, A-Z Index, and a search.&lt;ref name=&quot;wwwibar&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/home/whatisbbci/on_web.shtml|title=What is BBCi? – On the web|date=15 December 2002|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2 October 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20011215101431/http://www.bbc.co.uk/home/whatisbbci/on_web.shtml |archivedate=15 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, BBC interactive television services all offered a horizontal i-bar along the bottom of television screens, with four colour-coded interactions linked to the four colour buttons on TV remote controls.

After three years of consistent use across different platforms, the BBC began to drop the BBCi brand gradually; on 6 May 2004, the BBC website was renamed [[BBC Online|bbc.co.uk]], after the main [[Uniform resource locator|URL]] used to access the site.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbccouk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/05_may/04/bbc_co_uk.shtml|title=BBC website gets new look and new name: bbc.co.uk|date=4 May 2004|publisher=BBC Press Office|accessdate=30 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Interactive TV services continued under the BBCi brand until late 2008.

Today, the broadcaster's online video player, the [[BBC iPlayer]], reflects the branding legacy by retaining an i-prefix in its branding.

===The BBC Red Button brand (2008-present)===
From 2008, the BBC gradually began to drop the BBCi name from its digital interactive TV services also, replacing it with the name BBC Red Button.  The BBCi logo continued in on-screen presentation for some time.

In November 2008, the BBC celebrated 10 years of the digital interactive TV service.&lt;ref name=&quot;10years&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/11_november/06/button.shtml|title=BBC's Red Button celebrates its 10th anniversary|date=6 November 2008|publisher=BBC Press Office|accessdate=13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, the BBC launched a new service, BBC RED BUTTON HD but was only available for limited time and in July 2014, they re-launched it.

===BBC Connected Red Button (2012 - present)===
Launched in December 2012 on Virgin TiVo and on some Freeview and Freesat 'Smart TVs' in December 2013 Connected Red Button is a composite IP and broadcast service and may be the future of Red Button on internet connected televisions.[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/internet/posts/Promotional-Panel-Connected-Red-Button Connected Red Button on Freeview]

==Availability==
BBC Red Button is available on all digital television platforms in the UK, including [[digital cable]] through [[Virgin Media]], [[IPTV]] through [[TalkTalk TV]], digital [[satellite television|satellite]] through [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] and [[Freesat]] and [[digital terrestrial television]] through [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]]. It is also available in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] through Sky. On Freeview interactivity does not permit users to submit data (such as answering questions in a quiz or requesting [[video on demand]]), as the platform does not provide a [[bounce address|return path]].

==Content==
{{Update|inaccurate=yes|section|date=February 2012}}
Generally, BBC Red Button offers text and video based services, as well as enhanced television programmes which offer extra information, video or quizzes.

In September 2005, BBCi launched an update to the interactivity available from the [[BBC Radio|BBC's Radio]] channels on Freeview.  Originally only Radiotext was available.  After the update, users could access information about the programme, schedules, news, sport and weather.  From 2005, Freeview users could access the CBBC Extra video stream.

The same team behind the BBC's digital text service also launched the early incarnations of the BBC's Interactive Wimbledon and Interactive Open Golf services in 2000, which were awarded an Interactive [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] that year.

The News Multiscreen was removed from the digital service in October 2009, to make room for future Freeview HD broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2009/10/change_to_freeview.html BBC – The Editors: Closing the News Multiscreen] Pete Clifton.

==Compatibility==
The service was initially compatible with ONdigital and [[ITV Digital]] boxes, though loading speeds were slower than newer Freeview boxes.

Page numbers were introduced in 2004 to aid navigation, with 3-digit page numbers matching with those of the analogue Ceefax in 2006.  Pages exclusive to digital are given a four digit number.

The ''[[Teletext Ltd.|Teletext]]'' service from the UK commercial broadcasters had stopped supporting the old boxes in 2005. As of 2010, the ONdigital boxes only load pages 100 and 199 and some interactive services that use channel 301, if any other page is loaded it exits the service.

Usage of these boxes dwindled further as technology developed.  They used &quot;original&quot; technology and as such were not upgradable.  Following each regional changeover to full digital TV broadcasting, the remaining units are no longer of use, as they do not support the '8K-mode' for DVB-T introduced across the UK as part of the '[[Digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom#Post-switchover|digital switchover]]'.
