Until the 20th century, the lands of modern-day Belarus belonged to several countries, including the [[Principality of Polotsk]], the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and the [[Russian Empire]]. In the aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]], Belarus declared independence as the [[Belarusian People's Republic]], succeeded by the [[Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia]], which became a founding [[Republics of the Soviet Union|constituent republic of the Soviet Union]] and was renamed as the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (BSSR). Belarus lost almost half of its territory to Poland after the [[Polish-Soviet war]]. Much of the borders of Belarus took their modern shape in 1939 when some lands of the [[Second Polish Republic]] were reintegrated into it after the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] and were finalized after World War&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref name=&quot;uni1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=o85YDMTeMrUC&amp;dq=reunification+of+western+belarus |title=National purpose in the world economy: post-Soviet states in comparative perspective |last=Abdelal|first=Rawi |year=2001 |publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] |isbn=978-0-8014-3879-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;uni2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wGA4o-UhAfgC&amp;pg=PA713&amp;dq=reunification+of+western+belarus#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=Europa World Year, Book 1|last=Taylor &amp; Francis Group |year=2004 |publisher=[[Routledge|Europa publications]] |isbn=978-1-85743-254-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;uni3&quot;/&gt; The nation and its territory were devastated in World War&amp;nbsp;II, during which Belarus lost about a third of its population and more than half of its economic resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;axell&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Axell | first = Albert | title = Russia's Heroes, 1941–45 | publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers | year= 2002 | page = 247 | url =  | isbn = 0-7867-1011-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The republic was redeveloped in the post-war years. In 1945, Belarus became a founding member of the United Nations, along with the Soviet Union and the [[Ukrainian SSR]].

The parliament of the republic declared the [[sovereignty]] of Belarus on {{Nowrap|27 July}} 1990, and during the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Belarus declared independence on {{Nowrap|25 August}} 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bo.html|title=The World Factbook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Lukashenko]] has been the country's president since 1994. Lukashenko continued a number of Soviet-era policies, such as [[state ownership]] of large sections of the economy. According to many countries and organizations, elections under Alexander Lukashenko have been widely criticized as being unfair, and that political opposition has been violently suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/belarus|accessdate=28 December 2010|title=Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights&amp;nbsp;– Elections&amp;nbsp;– Belarus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2010/12/belaruss_election_0?fsrc=scn/fb/wl/bl/whatshouldtheeudo|accessdate=28 December 2010|title=Belarus's election: What should the EU do about Belarus? &amp;#124; The Economist | date=27 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=504974682|accessdate=28 December 2010|title=Foreign Secretary expresses UK concern following Belarus elections}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Belarus and Russia signed a treaty for greater cooperation, with some hints of forming a [[Union State]]. Belarus' [[Democracy Index]] rating continuously ranks the lowest in Europe, the country is labelled as &quot;Not Free&quot; by [[Freedom House]], &quot;Repressed&quot; in the [[Index of Economic Freedom]], and is rated as by far the worst country for [[press freedom]] in Europe in the [[Press Freedom Index|2013-14 Press Freedom Index]] published by [[Reporters Without Borders]], where Belarus is ranked 157th out of an overall total of 180 nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| publisher = [[Reporters Without Borders]]| title = Press Freedom Index 2013/2014| date = January 2014| url = http://rsf.org/index2014/en-index2014.php| accessdate = 6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 70% of Belarus's population of 9.49&amp;nbsp;million resides in urban areas. More than 80% of the population is ethnic Belarusian, with sizable minorities of [[Russians]], [[Poles]] and [[Ukrainians]]. Since a referendum in 1995, the country has had two official languages: [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. The [[Constitution of Belarus]] does not declare any official religion, although the primary religion in the country is [[Belarusian Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christianity]]. The second most popular, [[Roman Catholicism in Belarus|Roman Catholicism]], has a much smaller following, although both Orthodox and Catholic versions of Christmas and Easter are celebrated as [[Public holidays in Belarus|national holidays]].

==Etymology==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
The name ''Belarus'' corresponds literally with the term ''[[White Rus']]''. There are several claims to the origin of the name ''White Rus'.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaprudnik 1993 2&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zaprudnik|1993|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ethno-religious theory suggests that the name used to describe the part of old [[Ruthenia]]n lands within the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] that had been populated mostly by early Christianized Slavs, as opposed to [[Black Ruthenia]], which was predominantly inhabited by pagan Balts.&lt;ref&gt;Аб паходжанні назваў Белая і Чорная Русь (Eng. &quot;About the Origins of the Names of White and Black Ruthenia&quot;), Язэп Юхо (Joseph Juho), 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternate explanation for the name comments on the white clothing worn by the local Slavic population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaprudnik 1993 2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Minahan|1998|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third theory suggests that the old Rus' lands that were not conquered by the [[Tatars]] (i.e., Polatsk, Vitsiebsk and Mahilyow) had been referred to as &quot;white.&quot; Other sources claim that, before 1267, the land not conquered by the Mongols was considered &quot;White Rus'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaprudnik 1993 2&quot;/&gt;

The name [[Rus' (region)|Rus']] is often conflated with its Latin forms [[Russia]] and [[Ruthenia]], thus Belarus is often referred to as ''White Russia'' or ''White Ruthenia''. The name first appeared in [[Medieval German literature|German]] and [[Medieval Latin literature|Latin]] [[medieval literature]]; the chronicles of [[Jan of Czarnków]] mention the imprisonment of Lithuanian grand duke [[Jogaila]] and his mother at &quot;Albae Russiae, Poloczk dicto&quot; in 1381.&lt;ref name=&quot;vauchez&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Vauchez|Dobson|Lapidge|2001|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some languages, including German and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the country is generally called &quot;White Russia&quot; to this day (''Weißrussland'' and ''Wit-Rusland'' respectively).

The Latin term &quot;Alba Russia&quot; was used again by [[Pope Pius&amp;nbsp;VI]] to recognize the [[Society of Jesus]] there 1783, exclaiming &quot;Approbo Societatem Jesu in Alba Russia degentem, approbo, approbo.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|de Courson|1879|p=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known use of ''White Russia'' to refer to Belarus was in the late-16th century by Englishman Sir [[Jerome Horsey]], who was known for his close contacts with the Russian Royal Court.&lt;ref name=&quot;alies&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Bely | first = Alies&quot; | title = The chronicle of the White Russia: an essay on the history of one geographical name | publisher=Encyclopedix | year= 2000 | location = Minsk, Belarus | isbn = 985-6599-12-1|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 17th century, the Russian [[Tsar]]s used &quot;White Rus&quot; to describe the lands added from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Plokhy|2001|p=327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stemp Efrasinia Polackaja.jpg|thumb|Stamp with the [[Cross of Saint Euphrosyne|Cross of St. Euphrosyne]] from 1992]]

The term ''Belorussia'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Белору́ссия}}; the latter part similar but spelled and stressed differently from Росси́я, ''Russia'') first rose in the days of the [[Russian Empire]], and the Russian Tsar was usually styled &quot;the Tsar of All Russia&quot;, as ''Russia'' or the ''Russian Empire'' was formed by three parts of Russia—the [[Great Russia|Great]], [[Little Russia|Little]], and [[White Russia|White]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=XAItI5C_JPUC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=Belorussia+Russian+Empire |title=Where Nation-States Come From: Institutional Change in the Age of Nationalism |author=Philip G. Roeder|date=15 December 2011 |isbn=978-0-691-13467-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This asserted that the territories are all Russian and all the peoples are also Russian; in the case of the Belarusians, they were variants of the Russian people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/?id=oUydX_3rG0AC&amp;pg=PA385&amp;lpg=PA385&amp;dq=Belorussia+name |title=Handbook of Language and Ethnic Identity: The Success-Failure Continuum in Language and Ethnic Identity Efforts  |date=13 April 2011 |isbn=978-0-19-983799-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] in 1917, the term White Russia caused some confusion as it was also the name of the military force that opposed the red Bolsheviks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richmond|1995|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of the Belorussian SSR, the term ''Byelorussia'' was embraced as part of a national consciousness. In western Belarus under Polish control, ''Byelorussia'' became commonly used in the regions of Białystok and Grodno during the interwar period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ioffe | first = Grigory | title = Understanding Belarus and How Western Foreign Policy Misses the Mark | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc | date = 25 February 2008 | page = 41 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=00B6wxgftH8C&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=west+belarus | isbn=0-7425-5558-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''Belorussia'' (its names in other languages such as English being based on the Russian form) was only used officially until 1991, when the [[Supreme Soviet of the Byelorussian SSR|Supreme Soviet]] of the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic decreed by law that the new independent republic should be called ''Republic of Belarus'' (&quot;Республика Беларусь&quot; spelled in Russian), as well its abridged form should be &quot;Belarus&quot;. The law decreed that all the forms of the new term should be transliterated into other languages from their [[Belarusian language]] forms. The use of Byelorussian SSR and any abbreviations thereof were allowed from 1991 to 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;bynamelaw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pravo.kulichki.com/zak/year1991/doc47159.htm |title=Law of the Republic of Belarus — About the name of the Republic of Belarus |accessdate=6 October 2007 |date=19 September 1991 |publisher=Pravo — Law of the Republic of Belarus |language=Russian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative forces in the newly independent Belarus did not support the name change and opposed its inclusion in the 1991 draft of the [[Constitution of Belarus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ryder|1998|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, the name ''Belorussia'' was replaced by ''Belarus'' in English&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaprudnik 1993 4-5&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Zaprudnik|1993|pp=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to some extent in Russian (although the traditional name persists in that language as well); likewise, the adjective ''Belorussian'' or ''Byelorussian'' was replaced by ''Belarusian'' in English (though Russian has not developed a new adjective). ''Belarusian'' is closer to the original Russian term of ''bielaruski''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaprudnik 1993 4-5&quot;/&gt; Belarusian intelligentsia in the Stalin era attempted to change the name from ''Belorussia'' to a form of ''Krivia'' because of the supposed connection with Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Treadgold|Ellison|1999|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some nationalists also object to the name for the same reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://old.euroradio.fm/en/909/news/35335 |title=Swedish government urged to change Belarus' official name |accessdate=2 February 2010 |date=13 July 2009 |work=European Radio for Belarus }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;levy&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Levy|Spilling|2009|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several local popular newspapers kept the old name of the country in Russian in their names, for example ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda|Komsomolskaya Pravda v Byelorussii]]'', which is the localized publication of a popular Russian newspaper. Also, those who wish for Belarus to be reunited with Russia continue to use ''Belorussia''.&lt;ref name=&quot;levy&quot;/&gt; Officially, the full name of the country is &quot;Republic of Belarus&quot; (Рэспубліка Беларусь, Республика Беларусь, Respublika Belarus {{Audio|Republic of Belarus.ogg|listen}}).&lt;ref name=&quot;bynamelaw&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bo.html |title=Belarus&amp;nbsp;– Government |accessdate=22 December 2007 |date=13 December 2007 |work=[[The World Factbook]] |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071211220928/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bo.html| archivedate= 11 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Belarus}}

===Early history===
From 5000 to 2000 BCE, [[Bandkeramik]] cultures predominated. In addition, remains from the [[Dnieper-Donets culture]] were found in Belarus and parts of [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Shaw | first1 = Ian | last2 = Jameson | first2 = Robert | title = A Dictionary of Archaeology | publisher=Wiley | year = 2008 | pages = 203–204 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=8HKDtlPuM2oC&amp;pg=PA203 | isbn = 978-0-470-75196-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cimmerians]] and other pastoralists roamed through the area by 1,000 BCE, and by 500 BCE, Slavs had taken up residence, which was circumscribed by the [[Scythians]] who roamed its outskirts. Invaders from Asia, among whom were the [[Huns]] and [[Eurasian Avars|Avars]], swept through c. 400–600 CE, but were unable to dislodge the Slavic presence.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Atlas, Ancient and Classical World'', by John Haywood, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The region that is now Belarus was first settled by [[Baltic peoples|Baltic]] tribes in the 3rd century. Around the 5th century, the area was taken over by Slavic tribes. The takeover was partially due to the lack of military coordination of the Balts but the gradual assimilation of the Balts into Slavic culture was peaceful in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zaprudnik|1993|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 9th century the territory of modern Belarus became part of [[Kievan Rus']], a vast East Slavic state ruled by the [[Rurikid]] dynasty.

A number of authors started publishing in the Belarusian language, including [[Jan Czeczot]], [[Władysław Syrokomla]] and [[Konstanty Kalinowski]].

In a [[Russification]] drive in the 1840s, [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] prohibited the use of Belarusian language in public schools, campaigned against Belarusian publications and tried to pressure those who had converted to Catholicism under the Poles to reconvert to the Orthodox faith. In 1863, economic and cultural pressure exploded into a [[January Uprising|revolt]], led by Kalinowski.  After the failed revolt, the Russian government reintroduced the use of [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] to Belarusian in 1864 and banned the use of the [[Latin alphabet]].

During the negotiations of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], Belarus first declared independence under German occupation on {{Nowrap|25 March}} 1918, forming the [[Belarusian People's Republic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;birgerson&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Birgerson|2002|pages=105–106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ioffe | first = Grigory | title = Understanding Belarus and How Western Foreign Policy Misses the Mark | publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc | date = 25 February 2008 | page = 57 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=00B6wxgftH8C&amp;pg=PA150&amp;dq=west+belarus#v=onepage&amp;q=west%20belarus&amp;f=false  | isbn = 0-7425-5558-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately afterwards, the [[Polish–Soviet War]] ignited, and the territory of Belarus was divided between Poland and the Soviet Russia.

A part of Belarus under Russian rule emerged as the [[Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]] in 1919. Soon thereafter it merged to form the [[Lithuanian–Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]].

In the 1920s, agricultural reforms that culminated in the Belarusian phase of Soviet [[collectivization]] were set in motion. In the 1930s, the implementation of the Soviet [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|five-year plans for the national economy]] led to rapid industrialization.

After the war, Belarus was among the 51 founding countries of the [[United Nations Charter]] and as such it was allowed an additional vote at the UN, on top of the Soviet Union's vote.

After the December completion of the [[Belarusian presidential election, 2010|2010 presidential election]], Lukashenko was elected to a fourth straight term with nearly 80% of the vote in elections.

According to the government sources, {{as of|November 2011|lc=on}}, 58.9% of all Belarusians adhere to some kind of religion; out of those, [[Belarusian Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]] makes up about 82%.&lt;ref name=mfa/&gt; [[Roman Catholicism in Belarus|Roman Catholicism]] is practiced mostly in the western regions, and there are also different denominations of Protestantism (which date from the time of union with Protestant [[Sweden]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/country/bo-belarus/rel-religion |title=Belarusian Religion statistics, definitions and sources |publisher=Nationmaster.com |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other minorities practice Judaism, Islam and Neopaganism. Many Belarusians converted to the Russian Orthodox Church after Belarus was annexed by Russia following the partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. As a consequence, the Orthodox church now has more members than other denominations.

Belarus's Roman Catholic minority, which constitute about 9% of the country's population&lt;ref name=&quot;Belarus president visits Vatican&quot;/&gt; and is concentrated in the western part of the country, especially around [[Hrodna]], is made up of a mixture of Belarusians and the country's [[Poles|Polish]] and [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]] minorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Belarus – Religion&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/belarus/20.htm|title=Belarus - Religion|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement to the media regarding Belarusian-Vatican ties, President Lukashenko stated that Orthodox and Catholic believers are the &quot;two main confessors in our country&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.belta.by/en/news/president?id=363517 |title=Belarus, Roman Catholic Church may ink cooperation agreement - President / News / Belarus News &amp;#124; Belarusian news &amp;#124; Belarus today &amp;#124; news in Belarus &amp;#124; Minsk news &amp;#124; BELTA - Belarus News &amp;#124; Belarusian news &amp;#124; Belarus today &amp;#124; news in Belarus &amp;#124; Minsk news &amp;#124; BELTA |publisher=News.belta.by |date=25 April 2009 |accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total Roman Catholic population has dropped to 12% of religious believers, according to a 2011 report by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.&lt;ref name=mfa/&gt;

Belarus was once a major center of European Jewry, with 10% of the population being [[History of the Jews in Belarus|Jewish]].

===Arts and literature===
[[File:Theatre opera&amp;ballet, Minsk.JPG|thumb|The [[National Opera and Ballet of Belarus|Opera and Ballet Theater]] in Minsk]]
The Belarusian government sponsors annual cultural festivals such as the [[Slavianski Bazaar in Vitebsk]], which showcases Belarusian performers, artists, writers, musicians, and actors. Several state holidays, such as [[List of countries by Independence Day|Independence Day]] and [[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]], draw big crowds and often include displays such as fireworks and military parades, especially in Vitebsk and Minsk.&lt;ref name=&quot;festivals&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.belarusembassy.org/belarus/culture.htm| title=Belarusian National Culture| publisher=Embassy of the Republic of Belarus in the United States of America| accessdate=26 March 2006| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060210203549/http://www.belarusembassy.org/belarus/culture.htm| archivedate = 10 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government's Ministry of Culture finances events promoting Belarusian arts and culture both inside and outside the country.

[[File:Skaryna 1517.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Francysk Skaryna]], developer of the Belarusian language, and one of the first people to print in the [[Cyrillic]] alphabet]]
Belarusian literature began with 11th- to 13th-century religious scripture, such as the 12th-century poetry of [[Cyril of Turaw]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bypoem&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belarusguide.com/culture1/literature/Old_Poetry.html |title=Old Belarusian Poetry |accessdate=9 October 2007 |year=1994 |publisher=Virtual Guide to Belarus | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011050535/http://www.belarusguide.com/culture1/literature/Old_Poetry.html| archivedate= 11 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 16th century, [[Polotsk]] resident [[Francysk Skaryna]] translated the Bible into Belarusian. It was published in [[Prague]] and [[Vilnius]] sometime between 1517 and 1525, making it the first book printed in Belarus or anywhere in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;byeb&quot;&gt;&quot;Belarus.&quot; [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-33482 Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The modern era of Belarusian literature began in the late 19th century; one prominent writer was [[Yanka Kupala]]. Many Belarusian writers of the time, such as [[Uładzimir Žyłka]], Kazimir Svayak, [[Yakub Kolas]], [[Źmitrok Biadula]], and [[Maksim Haretski]], wrote for ''[[Nasha Niva]]'', a Belarusian-language paper published in Vilnius.

After Belarus was incorporated into the Soviet Union, the Soviet government took control of the Republic's cultural affairs. At first, a policy of &quot;Belarusianization&quot; was followed in the newly formed B.S.S.R. (Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic).  This policy was reversed in the 1930s, and the majority of prominent Belarusian intellectuals and nationalist advocates were either exiled or killed in Stalinist purges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tereshkovich|first=Pavel|author2=Robert J.

[[Music of Belarus|Music in Belarus]] largely comprises a rich tradition of folk and religious music. The country's folk music traditions can be traced back to the times of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. In the 19th century, Polish composer [[Stanisław Moniuszko]] composed operas and chamber music pieces while living in Minsk. During his stay, he worked with Belarusian poet [[Vintsent Dunin-Martsinkyevich]] and created the opera ''Sialanka'' (''Peasant Woman''). At the end of the 19th century, major Belarusian cities formed their own opera and ballet companies. The ballet ''[[Nightingale (ballet)|Nightingale]]'' by M. Kroshner was composed during the Soviet era and became the first Belarusian ballet showcased at the National Academic Vialiki Ballet Theatre in Minsk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Crystal | last=Zou | title=Ballets for Christmas | date=11 December 2003 | url =http://app1.chinadaily.com.cn/star/2003/1211/wh28-1.html | work=Shanghai Star | accessdate =20 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], music focused on the hardships of the Belarusian people or on those who took up arms in defense of the homeland. During this period, [[Anatoly Bogatyrev]], creator of the opera ''In Polesye Virgin Forest'', served as the &quot;tutor&quot; of Belarusian composers.&lt;ref name=&quot;clasmus&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belarusguide.com/culture1/music/Belarusian_composers_&amp;_classical_music.htm |title=Classical Music of Belarus |publisher=Belarusguide.com |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Academic Theatre of Ballet, in Minsk, was awarded the [[Prix Benois de la Danse|Benois de la Dance Prize]] in 1996 as the top ballet company in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;clasmus&quot;/&gt; Rock music has become increasingly popular in recent years, though the Belarusian government has attempted to limit the amount of foreign music aired on the radio in favor of traditional Belarusian music. Since 2004, Belarus has been sending artists to the [[Eurovision Song Contest]].&lt;ref&gt;National State Teleradiocompany {{Wayback |date=20080224183337 |url=http://www.tvr.by/eng/konkurs.asp |title=Page on the 2004 Belarusian entry to the Eurovision Song Contest }}.

The famous artist [[Marc Chagall]] was born in Liozna (near the city of [[Vitebsk]]) in 1887, today Belarus. He spent the [[World War I]] years in Soviet Belarus, becoming one of the country's most distinguished artists and a member of the modernist [[avant-garde]], founding the Vitebsk Arts College before leaving for Paris in 1922.

===Dress===
The traditional Belarusian dress originates from the [[Kievan Rus']] period. Due to the cool climate, clothes were designed to preserve body heat and were usually made from [[flax]] or [[wool]]. They were decorated with ornate patterns influenced by the neighboring cultures: Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, Russians, and other European nations. Each region of Belarus has developed specific design patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belarusguide.com/culture1/clothing/index.html |title=Belarusian traditional clothing |publisher=Belarusguide.com |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; One ornamental pattern common in early dresses currently decorates the hoist of the [[Flag of Belarus|Belarusian national flag]], adopted in a [[Belarusian referendum, 1995|disputed referendum]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fotw.fivestarflags.com/by.html#orn |title=Belarus – Ornament, Flags of the World |publisher=Fotw.fivestarflags.com |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
[[File:Potato pancakes.jpg|thumb|right|[[Potato pancake|Draniki]], the national dish]]

[[Belarusian cuisine]] consists mainly of vegetables, meat (especially pork), and bread. Foods are usually either slowly cooked or stewed. Typically, Belarusians eat a light breakfast and two hearty meals, with dinner being the largest meal of the day. Wheat and rye breads are consumed in Belarus, but rye is more plentiful because conditions are too harsh for growing wheat. To show hospitality, a host traditionally presents an offering of [[bread and salt]] when greeting a guest or visitor.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Citizenship and Immigration&amp;nbsp;– [http://www.cp-pc.ca/english/belarus/eating.html Cultures Profile Project&amp;nbsp;– Eating the Belarusian Way].

Belarus has competed in the Olympic Games since the [[1994 Winter Olympics]]. Its [[National Olympic Committee]] has been headed by President Lukashenko since 1997; he is the only head of state in the world to hold this position.

Receiving heavy sponsorship from the government, [[ice hockey]] is the nation's second most popular sport after [[Association football|football]].

In 2008, there were 3.718&amp;nbsp;million phone landlines used in comparison to {{Nowrap|8.639 million}} cellular phones in Belarus. Most of the phone lines are operated by Beltelecom, a state-owned company. About two-thirds of all of the phone services are run on digital systems, and the mobile-cellular [[teledensity]] is about 90 phones per 100 persons. There are approximately 113,000 internet hosts in Belarus in 2009 to meet the needs of approximately {{Nowrap|3.107 million}} Internet users.&lt;ref name=&quot;ciabo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bo.html |title=Belarus |accessdate=26 April 2010 |date=21 April 2010 |work=[[The World Factbook]] |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100424035944/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bo.html| archivedate= 24 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest media holding group in Belarus is the state-owned [[National State Television and Radio Company of the Republic of Belarus|National State Teleradiocompany]]. It operates several television and radio stations that broadcast content domestically and internationally, either through traditional signals or the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvr.by/eng/about.asp |title=About us, National State Teleradiocompany |publisher=Tvr.by |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Television Broadcasting Network is one of the major independent television stations in Belarus, mostly showing regional programming. Several [[List of newspapers in Belarus|newspapers]], printed either in Belarusian or Russian, provide general information or special interest content, such as business, politics or sports. In 1998, there were fewer than 100 radio stations in Belarus: 28 [[AM broadcasting|AM]], 37 [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and 11 [[shortwave]] stations.&lt;ref name=&quot;ciabo&quot;/&gt;

All media companies are regulated by the Law on Press and Other Mass Media, passed on {{Nowrap|13 January}} 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;presslaw&quot;&gt;[http://www.law.by/work/EnglPortal.nsf/6e1a652fbefce34ac2256d910056d559/1f80c30387b1623dc2256dc00051dc63?OpenDocument Law On Press and Other Mass Media, Law of the Republic of Belarus]{{dead link|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This grants the freedom of press; however, Article 5 proscribes [[slander]] against the President of Belarus or other officials outlined in the national constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;presslaw&quot;/&gt;
The Belarusian Government has since been criticized for acting against media outlets. Newspapers such as ''[[Nasha Niva]]'' and the ''Belaruskaya Delovaya Gazeta'' have been targeted for closure by the authorities after they published reports critical of President Lukashenko or other government officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2006-04-19-newsitem-en.html |title=Independent Belarusian newspaper &quot;Nasha Niva&quot; to close |publisher=Eurozine.com |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belarusian.minsk.usembassy.gov/policy20030530.html |title=Media Freedom in Belarus |accessdate=26 April 2010 |date=30 May 2003 |work=2003 Policy Archive |publisher=United States Department of State }}&lt;/ref&gt; The OSCE and [[Freedom House]] have commented regarding the loss of press freedom in Belarus. In 2009, Freedom House gave Belarus a score of 6.75 (not free) when it came to dealing with press freedom. Another issue for the Belarusian press is the unresolved disappearance of several journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/report/nations-transit/2009/belarus |title=Nations in Transit 2009&amp;nbsp;– Belarus |accessdate=26 April 2010 |year=2009 |publisher=Freedom House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Heritage Sites===
Belarus has four [[UNESCO]]-designated [[World Heritage Site]]s: the [[Mir Castle Complex]], the [[Nesvizh Castle]], the [[Białowieża Forest|Belovezhskaya Pushcha]] (shared with [[Poland]]), and the [[Struve Geodetic Arc]] (shared with nine other countries).&lt;ref name=&quot;UNSECO&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/by| title=Belarus&amp;nbsp;– UNESCO World Heritage Centre| accessdate=26 March 2006| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060421205516/http://whc.unesco.org/en/statesparties/by| archivedate= 21 April 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
