'''''Blazing Saddles'''''  is a 1974 [[satire|satirical]] [[Western film|Western]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Mel Brooks]]. Starring [[Cleavon Little]] and [[Gene Wilder]], the film was written by Brooks, [[Andrew Bergman]], [[Richard Pryor]], Norman Steinberg, and Al Uger, and was based on Bergman's story and draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getback.com/movie/blazing-saddles/1499232 |title=Director and Leading Actors |publisher=Getback.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie was nominated for three [[Academy Award]]s, and is ranked No. 6 on the [[American Film Institute]]'s ''[[AFI's 100 Years...100 Laughs|100 Years...100 Laughs]]'' list.

Brooks appears in two supporting roles, Governor William J. Le Petomane and a [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]-speaking Indian chief; he also dubs lines for one of Lili von Shtupp's backing troupe. The supporting cast includes [[Slim Pickens]], [[Alex Karras]], and [[David Huddleston]], as well as Brooks regulars [[Dom DeLuise]], [[Madeline Kahn]], and [[Harvey Korman]]. Bandleader  [[Count Basie]] has a cameo as himself.

The film satirizes the [[racism]] obscured by myth-making [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] accounts of the [[American Old West|American West]], with the hero being a [[African American|black]] sheriff in an all-white town.  The film is full of deliberate [[anachronism]]s, from the [[Count Basie Orchestra]] playing &quot;[[April in Paris (song)|April in Paris]]&quot; in the Wild West, to Slim Pickens referring to the ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'', to the [[German Army (1935–45)|German army]] of [[World War II]].

==Plot==
In the [[American Old West]] of 1874, construction on a new railroad led by Lyle ([[Burton Gilliam]]) runs into [[quicksand]]. The route has to be changed, which will require it to go through [[Rockridge, Oakland, California#History|Rock Ridge]], a [[frontier|frontier town]] where everyone has the last name of &quot;Johnson&quot; (including a &quot;[[Howard Johnson's|Howard Johnson]],&quot; a &quot;[[Dr. Samuel Johnson]],&quot; a &quot;[[Van Johnson]]&quot; and an &quot;[[Olsen and Johnson|Olson N. Johnson]]&quot;). The conniving [[State Attorney General]] Hedley Lamarr ([[Harvey Korman]]) wants to buy the land along the new railroad route cheaply by driving out the townspeople. He sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky assistant Taggart ([[Slim Pickens]]), to scare them away, prompting the townsfolk to demand that Governor William J. [[Le Petomane]] ([[Mel Brooks]]) appoint a new [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]]. Lamarr persuades the dim-witted Le Petomane to select Bart ([[Cleavon Little]]), a black railroad worker who was about to be hanged, as he believes a black lawman will so offend the townspeople that they will either abandon Rock Ridge or [[lynching|lynch]] the new sheriff, with either result paving the way for him to take over the town.

With his quick wits and the assistance of drunken [[gunslinger]] Jim ([[Gene Wilder]]), also known as &quot;The Waco Kid&quot; (&quot;I must have killed more men than [[Cecil B. DeMille]]&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;blzngsddlsqts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garnersclassics.com/qblazing.htm |title=Quotes from '&amp;#39;Blazing Saddles'&amp;#39; (1974) – |publisher=Garnersclassics.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bart works to overcome the townsfolk's hostile reception. He defeats and befriends Mongo ([[Alex Karras]]), an immensely strong, slow-thinking (but surprisingly philosophical) henchman sent by Taggart and Lyle to kill Bart, and then beats German seductress-for-hire Lili von Shtupp ([[Madeline Kahn]]) at her own game. Lamarr is furious that his plans keep failing and decides to destroy Rock Ridge with a newly recruited and diverse army of thugs, including western outlaws, [[Ku Klux Klan|Klansmen]], [[Nazi]] soldiers, [[outlaw biker]]s and other stereotypical &quot;bad guys&quot;.

Bart gathers the town, along with the railroad workers, three miles east of Rock Ridge to build a fake town as a diversion. The workers labor all night to build a perfect replica, but with no people in it Bart realises it won't fool Lamarr's villains. Ordering the townspeople to make &quot;exact replicas of themselves,&quot; Bart leaves with Jim and Mongo to construct a tollbooth. When the raiding party arrives at the booth, Taggart is forced to send someone back to &quot;Get a shitload of dimes&quot;, as the villains have neither the change to go through it, nor enough common sense to simply ride around it.

Once through the tollbooth, Lamarr's villains attack the fake town populated with dummies, which Bart boobytrapped with several dynamite bombs. Bart tries setting off the bombs but is unsuccessful as the detonator does not work.  Jim is given the task of exploding the bombs, and fires his pistol at them. After the bombs explode, launching villains skyward, the Rock Ridgers attack the villains.

The resulting fight between the townsfolk and Lamarr's army of thugs breaks the [[fourth wall]], literally.  The fight spills out from the Warner Bros. film lot into a neighboring musical set being directed by Buddy Bizarre ([[Dom DeLuise]]), then into the studio [[Refectory|commissary]], and ultimately into the surrounding streets (specifically, Olive Avenue in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]]).  The citizens chase the villains back to Rock Ridge to destroy them, but Lamarr takes a taxi &quot;. . . off this picture.&quot;  He arrives at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] to watch the &quot;premiere&quot; of ''Blazing Saddles''.  Unfortunately, he sees on the movie screen that Bart has arrived outside the theatre.  Bart ends up killing Lamarr by shooting him in the groin.  Bart and Jim then go into the theatre to watch the end of the film, where Bart decides to leave Rock Ridge, much to the sadness of the townspeople and the railroad workers, for his work there is done. As he rides off, he finds Jim (who still has the popcorn that he bought at the theatre), and the two decide to go off to &quot;nowhere special.&quot;  They ride a short distance out of town, hand their horses off to the movie's [[Wrangler (profession)|wranglers]] and are driven away in a [[Cadillac Series 70#1971–1976|Cadillac]] limousine into the sunset.

* Mel Brooks also appears in a cameo as one of Hedley Lamarr's thugs, wearing sunglasses and a [[bomber jacket]]. He also dubbed the voice for one of the German chorus boys backing Madeline Kahn's performance of &quot;I'm Tired&quot;,&lt;ref name=crick&gt;Crick, Robert Alan. [http://books.google.com/books?id=LbtuDkazJfQC&amp;q=aviator ''The Big Screen Comedies of Mel Brooks''] McFarland, 2002. ISBN 9780786443260. pp. 65-66.  Quote:&quot;As for Mel Brooks himself, his aviator and voice-overs as a German dancer and cranky film-goer provide funny cameos...&quot; . The book credits him as playing &quot;William J. LePetomane/Indian Chief/Aviator/Voice of German Dancer/Voice of Moviegoer.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; speaking lines such as &quot;Give her a break!&quot;, &quot;She's not a snake&quot; and, &quot;Don't you know she's pooped?!&quot;

==Production==
The idea of ''Blazing Saddles'' came from an original script written by [[Andrew Bergman]], which Brooks described as &quot;hip talk — 1974 talk and expressions — happening in 1874 in the Old West&quot;. Brooks was immediately taken by the script, and despite having not worked with a writing team for some time, hired a group of writers, including Bergman, to expand on the script, reminding them &quot;Please do not write a polite script&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-news/mel-brooks-on-blazing-new-comedic-trails-in--blazing-saddles-215405381.html?soc_src=mediacontentsharebuttons | title = Mel Brooks on Blazing New Comedic Trails in 'Blazing Saddles' | first = Andrew | last = Pockross | date = 2014-05-09 | accessdate = 2014-05-09 | publisher = [[Yahoo! Movies]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brooks explained in the DVD commentary that the original title of the film, ''Tex X'' (as in the name of Black Muslim leader [[Malcolm X]]), was rejected, along with ''Black Bart'' and  ''Purple Sage''. Finally, Brooks concocted the title ''Blazing Saddles'' while taking a shower.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon&quot;&gt;[http://archive.salon.com/ent/movies/dvd/review/2001/05/08/blazing/ 2001 Review], mostly of Brooks's [[audio commentary (DVD)|DVD commentary]], from [[Salon.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Blazing Saddles'' was Brooks' first film shot in [[anamorphic format]]. To date, this film and ''[[History of the World, Part I]]'' are the only Brooks films in this format.

Brooks had repeated conflicts with studio executives over the cast and content. They objected to both the highly provocative script and to the &quot;irregular&quot; activities of the writers (particularly Richard Pryor, who reportedly led all-night writing jams where loud music and drugs played a prominent role). Brooks wanted Pryor to play the sheriff, but Warner executives expressed concern over Pryor's reliability because of his heavy drug use and the belief that he was mentally unstable.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon&quot;/&gt; While he kept Pryor as co-screenwriter, Brooks worked with Cleavon Little as Bart. In a similar vein, Gene Wilder was the second choice to play the Waco Kid. He was quickly brought in to replace a sick [[Gig Young]] after the first day of filming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0949574/bio IMDb Biography for Gig Young]&lt;/ref&gt;

After screening the movie, the head of Warner Bros. complained about the use of the word &quot;[[nigger]]&quot;, a flatulent campfire scene, and Mongo punching a horse, and told Brooks to remove those scenes. Since his contract gave him control of the final cut, Brooks disregarded the complaints and these elements remained. What was removed was a scene in which Bart responded to Lili's attempt to seduce him in the dark by quipping, &quot;I hate to disappoint you, ma'am, but you're sucking my arm.&quot; Brooks was asked about the use of &quot;nigger&quot; in the movie in an interview that appeared in the summer 2012 issue of the DGA Quarterly, the official magazine of the [[Directors Guild of America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DGA-Quarterly-summer2012&quot;&gt;

}} Page 36: '''Q:''' ''Blazing Saddles'' also makes frequent use of the &quot;N-word.&quot; Could you get away with that today? '''A:''' Never. If they did a remake of ''Blazing Saddles'' today, they would leave out the N-word. And then, you've got no movie. And I wouldn't have used it so much if I didn't have Richard Pryor with me on the set as one of my writers. And Cleavon Little [as Sheriff Bart] was great. Even though it was allowed, I kept asking Cleavon, &quot;Is that all right there? Is that too much there? Am I pushing this?&quot; and he'd say, &quot;no, no, no, it's perfect there.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; He said that if a remake of ''Blazing Saddles'' were to be made today, they would have to leave out the controversial word, but during filming, he had received support for its use from writer Richard Pryor and lead actor Cleavon Little.&lt;ref name=&quot;DGA-Quarterly-summer2012&quot; /&gt;

Brooks wanted the movie's title song to reflect the western genre, and advertised in the trade papers for a &quot;[[Frankie Laine]]-type&quot; sound. Several days later, Laine himself visited Brooks' office to offer his services. Brooks had not told Laine that the movie was a comedy: &quot;'Frankie sang his heart out... and we didn't have the heart to tell him it was a spoof&amp;nbsp;— we just said, 'Oh, great!'. He never heard the whip cracks; we put those in later.  We got so lucky with his serious interpretation of the song.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;libretto&quot;&gt;From the libretto of the La-LaLand Records soundtrack album&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview included in the DVD release of ''Blazing Saddles'', Brooks claimed that [[Hedy Lamarr]] threatened to sue, saying the film's running &quot;Hedley Lamarr&quot; joke infringed her right to privacy. This is lampooned when Hedley corrects Governor Le Petomane's pronunciation of his name, and Le Petomane replies with &quot;What the hell are you worried about? This is 1874, you'll be able to sue ''her!''&quot;. Brooks says he and the actress settled out of court for a small sum. In the same interview, Brooks related how he managed to persuade [[John Wayne]] to read the script after meeting him in the [[Warner Bros.]] studio commissary.  Wayne was impressed with the script, but politely declined a cameo, fearing it was &quot;too dirty&quot; for his family image.  He is also said to have told Brooks that he &quot;would be first in line to see the film, though&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Interview: [[Mel Brooks]]. ''Blazing Saddles'' (DVD).

==Reception==
While the film is widely considered a classic comedy today, critical reaction was mixed when the film was first released. [[Vincent Canby]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?title1=BLAZING%20SADDLES%20(MOVIE) Review of ''Blazing Saddles''] by [[Vincent Canby]]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|''Blazing Saddles'' has no dominant personality, and it looks as if it includes every gag thought up in every story conference. Whether good, bad or mild, nothing was thrown out.  [[Woody Allen|Mr. [Woody] Allen's]] comedy, though very much a product of our Age of Analysis, recalls the wonder and discipline of people like [[Buster Keaton|Keaton]] and [[Laurel and Hardy]]. Mr. Brooks's sights are lower. His brashness is rare, but his use of anachronism and anarchy recalls not the great film comedies of the past, but the middling ones like the Hope-Crosby [[Road to...|&quot;Road&quot; pictures]]. With his talent he should do much better than that.}}

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film four stars and called it a &quot;crazed grabbag of a movie that does everything to keep us laughing except hit us over the head with a [[rubber chicken]]. Mostly, it succeeds. It's an audience picture; it doesn't have a lot of classy polish and its structure is a total mess. But of course! What does that matter while Alex Karras is knocking a horse cold with a right cross to the jaw?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Roger Ebert|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19740207/REVIEWS/401010306/1023|title=Blazing Saddles | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film grossed $119.5 million in the box office becoming only the tenth film in history up to that point to pass the $100 million mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=blazingsaddles.htm |title=Blazing Saddles (1974) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date=1982-01-01 |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[film-critic]]s aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has 90% positive reviews based on 46 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blazing_saddles/|title=Blazing Saddles on Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=2012-10-05|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
In the scene where Lamarr addresses his band of bad guys, he says, &quot;You men are only risking your lives, while I am risking an almost-certain Academy Award nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]]!&quot; Harvey Korman did not, in fact, get an Oscar nomination, but the film did receive three other [[Academy Award]]s nominations in [[47th Academy Awards|1974]]: [[Academy Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|Best Actress in a Supporting Role]] for Madeline Kahn, [[Academy Award for Film Editing|Best Film Editing]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Music, Original Song]]. The film also earned two [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]] awards nominations, for [[BAFTA Award for Best Newcomer|Best Newcomer]] (Cleavon Little) and [[BAFTA Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]].

The film won the [[Writers Guild of America Award]] for &quot;[[Writers Guild of America Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen]]&quot; for writers Mel Brooks, Norman Steinberg, Andrew Bergman, Richard Pryor, and Alan Uger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071230/awards Awards for Blazing Saddles (1974)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, ''Blazing Saddles'' was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the [[Library of Congress]] and was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0071230/awards&lt;/ref&gt; The American film critic [[Dave Kehr]] queried if the historical significance of ''Blazing Saddles'' lay in the fact that it was the first film from a [[major film studios|major studio]] to have a [[fart joke]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://davekehr.com/?p=148 National Film Registry Announces New Titles]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

===TV pilot===
A television pilot was produced for CBS based on [[Andrew Bergman]]'s initial story, titled ''Black Bart,''&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0121113|Black Bart}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was the original title of the film. It featured [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]] as Bart and [[Steve Landesberg]] as his drunkard sidekick, a former Confederate officer named &quot;Reb Jordan&quot;. Mel Brooks had little if anything to do with the pilot, as writer Andrew Bergman is listed as the sole creator. The pilot did not sell, but CBS aired it once on April 4, 1975. It was later included as a bonus feature on the ''Blazing Saddles'' 30th Anniversary DVD and the [[Blu-ray]] disc.

===Musical adaptation===
With the production of musical adaptations of ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'' and ''[[Young Frankenstein (musical)|Young Frankenstein]]'', rumors spread about a possible adaptation of ''Blazing Saddles''. Brooks joked about the concept in the final number in ''Young Frankenstein'', in which the full company sings, &quot;next year, ''Blazing Saddles''!&quot; In 2010, Mel Brooks confirmed this, saying that the musical could be finished within a year. No creative team or plan has been announced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/137884-Back-on-the-Horse-Mel-Brooks-Penning-Songs-for-Blazing-Saddles- |title=Back on the Horse: Mel Brooks Penning Songs for Blazing Saddles Musical |publisher=Playbill.com |date=2010-03-16 |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soundtrack===
The first studio-licensed release of the full music soundtrack to ''Blazing Saddles'' was on [[La-La Land Records]] on August 26, 2008. Remastered from original studio vault elements, the limited edition CD (a run of 3000) features the songs from the film as well as composer [[John Morris (composer)|John Morris]]'s score.  Instrumental versions of all the songs are bonus tracks on the disc.  The disc features exclusive liner notes featuring comments from Mel Brooks and John Morris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lalalandrecords.com/BlazingSaddles.html |title='&amp;#39;Blazing Saddles'&amp;#39; press release at La-La Land Records |publisher=Lalalandrecords.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goofs==
At 14 minutes 28 seconds into the movie, as the town is being ravaged by &quot;a pack of murderers and thieves&quot;, a town citizen is lassoed around the legs. Seconds later, he is being dragged behind a horse, lassoed around the chest.
