An '''allele''' ({{IPAc-en|uk|ˈ|æ|l|iː|l}} or {{IPAc-en|us|ə|ˈ|l|iː|l}}), or '''allel''', is one of a number of alternative forms of the same [[gene]] or same [[Locus (genetics)|genetic locus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Basic glossary on genetic epidemiology&quot;/&gt; Sometimes, different alleles can result in different observable [[phenotypic trait]]s, such as different [[pigmentation]]. However, most genetic variations result in little or no observable variation.

Most [[multicellular organism]]s have two sets of [[chromosome]]s; that is, they are [[diploid]].  These chromosomes are referred to as [[homologous chromosome]]s. Diploid organisms have one copy of each gene (and, therefore, one allele) on each chromosome. If both alleles are the same, they and the organism are [[homozygous]] with respect to that gene. If the alleles are different, they and the organism are [[heterozygous]] with respect to that gene.

The word &quot;allele&quot; is a short form of '''allelomorph''' (&quot;other form&quot;), which was used in the early days of [[genetics]] to describe variant forms of a [[gene]] detected as different [[phenotypes]]. It derives from the Greek prefix ''ἀλλήλ'', ''allel'', meaning &quot;reciprocal&quot; or &quot;each other&quot;, which itself is related to the Greek adjective ἄλλος (allos; cognate with Latin &quot;alius&quot;), meaning &quot;other&quot;.

==Dominant and recessive alleles==
{{main|Dominance (genetics)}}
In many cases, genotypic interactions between the two alleles at a locus can be described as [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] or [[recessive]], according to which of the two homozygous phenotypes the heterozygote most resembles. Where the heterozygote is indistinguishable from one of the homozygotes, the allele involved is said to be [[Dominance (genetics)|dominant]] to the other, which is said to be [[recessive]] to the former.&lt;ref name=&quot;Essential genetics: A genomics perspective&quot;/&gt; The degree and pattern of dominance varies among loci. This type of interaction was first formally described by [[Gregor Mendel]]. However, many traits defy this simple categorization and the phenotypes are modeled by [[co-dominance]] and [[Quantitative trait locus|polygenic inheritance]].

The term &quot;[[wild type]]&quot; allele is sometimes used to describe an allele that is thought to contribute to the typical phenotypic character as seen in &quot;wild&quot; populations of organisms, such as fruit flies (''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''). Such a &quot;wild type&quot; allele was historically regarded as dominant, common, and normal, in contrast to &quot;[[mutant]]&quot; alleles regarded as recessive, rare, and frequently deleterious. It was formerly thought that most individuals were homozygous for the &quot;wild type&quot; allele at most gene loci, and that any alternative &quot;mutant&quot; allele was found in homozygous form in a small minority of &quot;affected&quot; individuals, often as [[genetic diseases]], and more frequently in heterozygous form in &quot;[[Genetic carrier|carriers]]&quot; for the mutant allele. It is now appreciated that most or all gene loci are highly polymorphic, with multiple alleles, whose frequencies vary from population to population, and that a great deal of genetic variation is hidden in the form of alleles that do not produce obvious phenotypic differences.

==Multiple alleles==
{{multiple image

The interaction of multiple genes—and the variation in these genes (&quot;alleles&quot;) between individuals—help to determine a person's eye color [[phenotype]]. Eye color is influenced by [[pigment]]ation of the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and the frequency-dependence of the light [[scattering]] by the [[Turbidity|turbid]] medium within the [[Stroma of iris|stroma]] of the iris.

[[File:ABO blood type.svg|thumb|right|300px|In the [[ABO blood group system]], a person with Type A blood displays A-antigens and may have a genotype I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; or I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;i. A person with Type B blood displays B-antigens and may have the genotype I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; or I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;i. A person with Type AB blood displays both A- and B-antigens and has the genotype I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; and a person with Type O blood, displaying neither antigen, has the genotype ii.]]

A [[population]] or [[species]] of organisms typically includes multiple alleles at each [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] among various individuals. Allelic variation at a locus is measurable as the number of alleles ([[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]) present, or the proportion of heterozygotes in the population.

For example, at the gene locus for the [[ABO]] [[blood type]] [[carbohydrate]] [[antigen]]s in humans,&lt;ref name=&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OnlineMendelianInheritanceinMan&quot;/&gt; classical genetics recognizes three alleles, I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;, I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;, and i, that determine compatibility of [[blood transfusion]]s. Any individual has one of six possible [[genotype]]s (I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;, I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;i, I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;, I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;i, I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;, and ii) that produce one of four possible [[phenotype]]s: &quot;Type A&quot; (produced by I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt; homozygous and I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;i heterozygous genotypes), &quot;Type B&quot; (produced by I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; homozygous and I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt;i heterozygous genotypes), &quot;Type AB&quot; produced by I&lt;sup&gt;A&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;B&lt;/sup&gt; heterozygous genotype, and &quot;Type O&quot; produced by ii homozygous genotype. It is now known that each of the A, B, and O alleles is actually a class of multiple alleles with different DNA sequences that produce proteins with identical properties: more than 70 alleles are known at the ABO locus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sequence variation at the human ABO locus&quot;/&gt; An individual with &quot;Type A&quot; blood may be an AO heterozygote, an AA homozygote, or an AA heterozygote with two different &quot;A&quot; alleles.

==Allele and genotype frequencies==
The frequency of alleles in a diploid population can be used to predict the frequencies of the corresponding genotypes (see [[Hardy-Weinberg principle]]). For a simple model, with two alleles:

: &lt;math&gt;p + q=1 \, &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;p^2 + 2pq + q^2=1 \,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''p'' is the frequency of one allele and ''q'' is the frequency of the alternative allele, which necessarily sum to unity. Then, ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the fraction of the population homozygous for the first allele, 2''pq'' is the fraction of heterozygotes, and ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the fraction homozygous for the alternative allele. If the first allele is dominant to the second then the fraction of the population that will show the dominant phenotype is ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2''pq'', and the fraction with the recessive phenotype is ''q''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

With three alleles:

: &lt;math&gt;p + q + r = 1 \, &lt;/math&gt; and

: &lt;math&gt;p^2 + 2pq + 2pr + q^2 + 2qr + r^2 = 1. \,&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of multiple alleles at a diploid locus, the number of possible genotypes (G) with a number of alleles (a) is given by the expression:

: &lt;math&gt;G= \frac{a(a+1)}{2}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Allelic dominance in genetic disorders==
A number of [[genetic disorders]] are caused when an individual inherits two recessive alleles for a single-gene trait. Recessive genetic disorders include [[Albinism]], [[Cystic Fibrosis]], [[Galactosemia]], [[Phenylketonuria]] (PKU), and [[Tay-Sachs Disease]]. Other disorders are also due to recessive alleles, but because the gene locus is located on the X chromosome, so that males have only one copy (that is, they are [[hemizygosity|hemizygous]]), they are more frequent in males than in females. Examples include red-green [[color blindness]] and [[Fragile X syndrome]].

Other disorders, such as [[Huntington disease]], occur when an individual inherits only one dominant allele.
