'''Asia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|ʒ|ə|audio=En-us-Asia.ogg}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|ʃ|ə}}) is the [[Earth|Earth's]] largest and most populous [[continent]], located primarily in the [[Eastern Hemisphere|eastern]] and [[northern hemisphere]]s.  Though it covers only 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area, it comprises 30% of earth's land area, and has historically been home to the bulk of the planet's [[human population]] (currently roughly 60%).  Asia is notable for not only overall large size and population, but unusually dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  Asia has exhibited economic dynamism (particularly East Asia) as well as robust population growth during the 20th century, but overall population growth has since fallen to world average levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.economist.com/diversions/millennium/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=346605 | title=Like herrings in a barrel | journal=The Economist | date=23 December 1999 | issue=Millennium issue: Population | publisher=The ''Economist'' online, The Economist Group}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The boundaries of Asia are culturally determined, as there is no clear geographical separation between it and [[Europe]], which together form one continuous landmass called [[Eurasia]]. The most commonly accepted boundaries place Asia to the east of the [[Suez Canal]], the [[Ural River]], and the [[Ural Mountains]], and south of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] (or the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]]) and the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea]]s.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Asia | url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110518/Asia | encyclopedia=eb.com, [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | year=2006 | location=Chicago | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=National Geographic Atlas of the World|edition=7th|year=1999|location=Washington, DC|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|isbn=978-0-7922-7528-2}} &quot;Europe&quot; (pp. 68–9); &quot;Asia&quot; (pp. 90–1): &quot;A commonly accepted division between Asia and Europe is formed by the Ural Mountains, Ural River, Caspian Sea, Caucasus Mountains, and the Black Sea with its outlets, the Bosporus and Dardanelles.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; It is bounded on the east by the [[Pacific Ocean]], on the south by the [[Indian Ocean]] and on the north by the [[Arctic Ocean]].

Given its size and diversity, the concept of Asia – a [[toponymy|name]] dating back to [[classical antiquity]] - may actually have more to do with [[human geography]] than [[physical geography]].&lt;ref name=McG-H&gt;{{cite web | title=Asia | url=http://accessscience.com/abstract.aspx?id=054800&amp;referURL=http%3a%2f%2faccessscience.com%2fcontent.aspx%3fid%3d054800 | work=AccessScience | publisher=McGraw-Hill | accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asia varies greatly across and within [[Regions of Asia|its regions]] with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems.

===Greek three-continent system===
[[File:two-point-equidistant-asia.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Two-point equidistant projection]] of Asia and surrounding landmasses.]]
[[File:Asiatiska folk, Nordisk familjebok.jpg|thumb|The racial diversity of Asia's peoples, [[Nordisk familjebok]] (1904)]]
The border between Asia and Europe has historically been determined by Europeans{{which|date=September 2014}} only.{{dubious|date=May 2014}}&lt;!--at the time the concept was first &quot;determined&quot; those determining it necessarily did not identify as &quot;Europeans&quot;. This is nonsense. Both &quot;Europe&quot; and &quot;Asia&quot; was first determined by Greeks, and they did not count themselves as either. &quot;Europe&quot; was Thracia, and &quot;Asia&quot; was Anatolia.
--&gt;
The original distinction between the two was made by the [[ancient Greek]]s. They used the [[Aegean Sea]], the [[Dardanelles]], the [[Sea of Marmara]], the [[Bosporus]], the [[Black Sea]], the [[Kerch Strait]], and the [[Sea of Azov]] as the border between Asia and Europe. The [[Nile]] was often used as the border between Asia and [[Africa]] (then called Libya), although some Greek geographers suggested the [[Red Sea]] would form a better boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myth&quot;&gt;{{harvnb | Lewis | Wigen | 1997 | pp=170–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Darius I|Darius]]' canal between the Nile and the Red Sea introduced considerable variation in opinion. Under the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] emptying into the Black Sea was the western border of Asia. It was the northernmost navigable point of the European shore.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} In the 15th century the Red Sea became established as the boundary between Africa and Asia, replacing the Nile.&lt;ref name=&quot;Myth&quot;/&gt;

===Asia–Europe boundary===
The Don River became unsatisfactory to northern Europeans when [[Peter the Great]], king of the [[Tsardom of Russia]], defeating rival claims of [[Sweden]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] to the eastern lands, and armed resistance by the tribes of [[Siberia]], synthesized a new [[Russian Empire]] extending to the [[Ural Mountains]] and beyond, founded in 1721. The major geographical theorist of the empire was actually a former Swedish prisoner-of-war, taken at the [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709 and assigned to [[Tobolsk]], where he associated with Peter's Siberian official, [[Vasily Tatishchev]], and was allowed freedom to conduct geographical and anthropological studies in preparation for a future book.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In Sweden, five years after Peter's death, in 1730 [[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]] published a new atlas proposing the Urals as the border of Asia. The Russians were enthusiastic about the concept, which allowed them to keep their European identity in geography. Tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von Strahlenberg. The latter had suggested the [[Emba River]] as the lower boundary. Over the next century various proposals were made until the [[Ural River]] prevailed in the mid-19th century. The border had been moved perforce from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea into which the Ural River projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|pp=27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the maps of the period, [[Transcaucasia]] was counted as Asian. The incorporation of most of that region into the [[Soviet Union]] tended to push views of the border to the south. Asian cultures had no say in this system of determining the imaginary boundaries separating them from Europe.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Asia–Oceania boundary===
The border between Asia and the loosely defined region of [[Oceania]] is usually placed somewhere in the [[Malay Archipelago]]. The terms Southeast Asia and Oceania, devised in the 19th century, have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception. The chief factor in determining which islands of the Malay Archipelago are Asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there (not all European). Lewis and Wigen assert, &quot;The narrowing of 'Southeast Asia' to its present boundaries was thus a gradual process.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Myth&quot;/&gt;

===Ongoing definition===
[[File:Afro-Eurasia (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|left|[[Afro-Eurasia]] shown in green]]
Geographical Asia is a cultural artifact of European conceptions of the world being imposed onto other cultures, an imprecise concept causing endemic contention about what it means. Asia is larger and more culturally diverse than Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|pp=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does not exactly correspond to the cultural borders of its various types of constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|pp=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of [[Herodotus]] a minority of geographers have rejected the three-continent system (Europe, Africa, Asia) on the grounds that there is no or is no substantial physical separation between them.&lt;ref name=McG-H /&gt; For example, Sir [[Barry Cunliffe]], the emeritus professor of European archeology at Oxford, argues that Europe has been geographically and culturally merely &quot;the western excrescence of the continent of Asia&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200812/editors-choice |title=Geography Is Destiny | first=Benjamin | last=Schwartz | journal=The Atlantic |date = December 2008|publisher=Atlantic Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographically, Asia is the major eastern constituent of the continent of [[Eurasia]] with Europe being a northwestern [[peninsula]] of the landmass – or of [[Afro-Eurasia]]; geologically, Asia, Europe and Africa make up a single continuous landmass (except for the Suez Canal) and share a common [[continental shelf]]. Almost all of Europe and the better part of Asia sit atop the [[Eurasian Plate]], adjoined on the south by the [[Arabian Plate|Arabian]] and [[Indian Plate]] and with the easternmost part of Siberia (east of the [[Chersky Range]]) on the [[North American Plate]].

== Etymology ==
[[File:Gulf5..JPG|thumb|300px|Ptolemy's Asia]]
The English word, &quot;Asia,&quot; was originally a concept of [[Greek civilization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;reid&quot;&gt;[[T.R. Reid|Reid, T.R.]] ''[[Confucius Lives Next Door: What living in the East teaches us about living in the west]]'' Vintage Books(1999).&lt;/ref&gt; The place name, &quot;Asia&quot;, in various forms in a large number of modern languages is of unknown ultimate provenience. Its etymology and language of origin are uncertain. It appears to be one of the most ancient of recorded names. A number of theories have been published. English Asia can be traced through the formation of English literature to Latin literature, where it has the same form, Asia. Whether all uses and all forms of the name derive also from the Latin of the [[Roman Empire]] is much less certain.

===Classical antiquity===
Latin Asia and Greek Ἀσία appear to be the same word. Roman authors translated Ἀσία as Asia. The Romans named a province [[Asia (Roman province)]], which roughly corresponds with modern-day central-western Turkey. There was an Asia Minor and an Asia Major located in modern-day [[Iraq]]. As the earliest evidence of the name is Greek, it is likely circumstantially that Asia came from Ἀσία, but ancient transitions, due to the lack of literary contexts, are difficult to catch in the act. The most likely vehicles were the ancient geographers and historians, such as [[Herodotus]], who were all Greek. Roman civilization Hellenized extensively. [[Ancient Greek]] certainly evidences early and rich uses of the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D*%29asi%2Fa | title=Ἀσία | author=Henry George Liddell |author2=Robert Scott|author3= Henry Stuart Jones|author4= Roderick McKenzie | encyclopedia=A Greek-English Lexicon | year=2007 | location=Medford | publisher=Perseus Digital Library, Tufts University | origyear=1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first continental use of Asia is attributed to Herodotus (about 440&amp;nbsp;BC), not because he innovated it, but because his ''Histories'' are the earliest surviving prose to describe it in any detail. He defines it carefully,&lt;ref&gt;Book IV, Articles 37–40.&lt;/ref&gt; mentioning the previous geographers whom he had read, but whose works are now missing. By it he means [[Anatolia]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], in contrast to [[Greece]] and [[Egypt]]. Herodotus comments that he is puzzled as to why three women's names were &quot;given to a tract which is in reality one&quot; ([[Europa (mythology)|Europa]], [[Asia (mythology)|Asia]], and [[Libya (mythology)|Libya]], referring to Africa), stating that most Greeks assumed that Asia was named after the wife of [[Prometheus]] (i.e. [[Hesione]]), but that the [[Lydia]]ns say it was named after Asies, son of Cotys, who passed the name on to a tribe at [[Sardis]].&lt;ref&gt;Book IV, Article 45.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greek mythology]], &quot;[[Asia (mythology)|Asia]]&quot; (''Ἀσία'') or &quot;Asie&quot; (''Ἀσίη'') was the name of a &quot;[[Nymph]] or [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] goddess of Lydia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theoi.com/Nymphe/NympheAsie.html | title=Asie | work=Encyclopedia: Greek Gods, Spirits, Monsters | publisher=Theoi Greek Mythology, Exploring Mythology in Classical Literature and Art | date=2000–2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herodotus' geographical puzzlement was perhaps only a form of disagreement, as, having read the earlier Greek poetry along with everyone else literate, he would have known perfectly well why places received female names. Athens, Mycenae, Thebes and many other locations in fact had them. In ancient Greek religion, places were under the care of female divinities, parallel to guardian angels. The poets detailed their doings and generations in allegoric language salted with entertaining stories, which subsequently playwrights transformed into classical Greek drama and became &quot;Greek mythology.&quot;

For example, [[Hesiod]] mentions the daughters of [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] and [[Oceanus|Ocean]], among whom are a &quot;holy company&quot;, &quot;who with the Lord [[Apollo]] and the Rivers have youths in their keeping.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Theogony'', Line 345 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these are geographic: Doris, Rhodea, Europa, Asia. Hesiod explains:&lt;ref&gt;''Theogony'', Line 364ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;For there are three-thousand neat-ankled daughters of Ocean who are dispersed far and wide, and in every place alike serve the earth and the deep waters.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The [[Iliad]] (attributed by the ancient Greeks to [[Homer]]) mentions two Phrygians (the tribe that replaced the [[Luvians]] in Lydia) in the [[Trojan War]] named [[Asius (mythology)|Asios]] (an adjective meaning &quot;Asian&quot;);&lt;ref&gt;Μ95, Π717.&lt;/ref&gt; and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in Lydia as ασιος.&lt;ref&gt;Β461.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bronze Age===
Before Greek poetry, the [[Aegean Sea]] area was in a [[Greek Dark Age]], at the beginning of which syllabic writing was lost and alphabetic writing had not begun. Prior to then in the [[Bronze Age]] the records of the [[Assyrian Empire]], the [[Hittite Empire]] and the various [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] states of Greece mention a region undoubtedly Asia, certainly in Anatolia, including if not identical to Lydia. These records are administrative and do not include poetry.

The Mycenaean states were destroyed about 1200&amp;nbsp;BC by unknown agents although one school of thought assigns the [[Dorian invasion]] to this time. The burning of the palaces baked clay diurnal administrative records written in a Greek syllabic script called [[Linear B]], deciphered by a number of interested parties, most notably by a young World War II cryptographer, [[Michael Ventris]], subsequently assisted by the scholar, [[John Chadwick]]. A major cache discovered by [[Carl Blegen]] at the site of ancient [[Pylos]] included hundreds of male and female names formed by different methods.

Some of these are of women held in servitude (as study of the society implied by the content reveals). They were used in trades, such as cloth-making, and usually came with children. The epithet, lawiaiai, &quot;captives,&quot; associated with some of them identifies their origin. Some are ethnic names. One in particular, aswiai, identifies &quot;women of Asia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ventris|Chadwick|1973|p=536}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps they were captured in Asia, but some others, Milatiai, appear to have been of [[Miletus]], a Greek colony, which would not have been raided for slaves by Greeks. Chadwick suggests that the names record the locations where these foreign women were purchased.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ventris|Chadwick|1973|p=410}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is also in the singular, Aswia, which refers both to the name of a country and to a female of it. There is a masculine form, aswios. This Aswia appears to have been a remnant of a region known to the Hittites as Assuwa, centered on Lydia, or &quot;Roman Asia.&quot; This name, ''Assuwa'', has been suggested as the origin for the name of the continent &quot;Asia&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bossert, Helmut T., ''Asia'', Istanbul, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Assuwa league]] was a confederation of states in western Anatolia, defeated by the [[Hittites]] under [[Tudhaliya I]] around 1400&amp;nbsp;BC.

Alternatively, the [[etymology]] of the term may be from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word ''{{Unicode|(w)aṣû(m)}}'', which means 'to go outside' or 'to ascend', referring to the direction of the sun at sunrise in the Middle East and also likely connected with the Phoenician word ''asa'' meaning east. This may be contrasted to a similar etymology proposed for ''Europe'', as being from Akkadian ''erēbu(m)'' 'to enter' or 'set' (of the sun).

[[T.R. Reid]] supports this alternative etymology, noting that the ancient Greek name must have derived from ''asu'', meaning 'east' in [[Assyria]]n (''ereb'' for ''Europe'' meaning 'west').&lt;ref name=&quot;reid&quot;/&gt; The ideas of ''Occidental'' (form [[Latin]] ''Occidens'' 'setting') and ''Oriental'' (from Latin ''Oriens'' for 'rising') are also European invention, synonymous with ''Western'' and ''Eastern''.&lt;ref name=&quot;reid&quot;/&gt; Reid further emphasizes that it explains the Western point of view of placing all the peoples and cultures of Asia into a single classification, almost as if there were a need for setting the distinction between Western and [[Eastern world|Eastern civilizations]] on the [[Eurasia]]n continent.&lt;ref name=&quot;reid&quot;/&gt; Ogura Kazuo and Tenshin Okakura are two outspoken Japanese figures on the subject.&lt;ref name=&quot;reid&quot;/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Asia}}
[[File:Mongol dominions1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Mongol Empire]], ca. 1300. The gray area is the later [[Timur|Timurid empire]].]][[File:Asien Bd1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|1890 map of Asia]]

The history of Asia can be seen as the distinct histories of several peripheral coastal regions: [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[Southeast Asia]] and the [[Middle East]], linked by the interior mass of the Central Asian [[steppe]]s.

The coastal periphery was home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys. The civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Indus Valley]] and the [[Huanghe River|Huanghe]] shared many similarities. These civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as [[mathematics]] and the wheel. Other innovations, such as writing, seem to have been developed individually in each area. Cities, states and empires developed in these lowlands.

The central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the [[steppe]]s. The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]], who spread their languages into the Middle East, South Asia, and the borders of [[China]], where the [[Tocharians]] resided. The northernmost part of Asia, including much of [[Siberia]], was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, climate and [[tundra]]. These areas remained very sparsely populated.

[[File:Silkroutes.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Silk Road]] connected many civilizations across Asia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silk-road.com/artl/srtravelmain.shtml ANCIENT SILK ROAD TRAVELLERS]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts. The [[Caucasus]] and [[Himalaya]] mountains and the [[Karakum Desert|Karakum]] and [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty. While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially, in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe. However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force; for this and other reasons, the [[nomad]]s who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies.

The Islamic [[Caliphate]] took over the Middle East and Central Asia during the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century. The [[Mongol Empire]] conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe. Before the Mongol invasion, [[Song China]] reportedly had approximately 120 million citizens; the 1300 census which followed the invasion reported roughly 60 million people.&lt;ref&gt;Ping-ti Ho. &quot;An Estimate of the Total Population of Sung-Chin China&quot;, in ''Études Song'', Series 1, No 1, (1970). pp. 33–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Black Death]], one of the most devastating [[pandemic]]s in human history, is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central Asia, where it then travelled along the [[Silk Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/blackdisease_01.shtml|title=BBC – History – Black Death |publisher=BBC |date=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Russian Empire]] began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, and would eventually take control of all of Siberia and most of [[Central Asia]] by the end of the 19th century. The [[Ottoman Empire]] controlled Anatolia, the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from the 16th century onwards. In the 17th century, the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] conquered China and established the [[Qing Dynasty]]. In the 16th century, the Islamic [[Mughal Empire]] controlled much of India.

==Geography and climate==
{{main|Geography of Asia|Climate of Asia}}
[[File:Himalayas.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] range is home to some of the planet's highest peaks.]]
Asia is the largest [[continent]] on Earth. It covers 8.8% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area), and has the largest coastline, at {{convert|62800|km|mi|0}}. Asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern four-fifths of [[Eurasia]]. It is located to the east of the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Ural Mountains]], and south of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] (or the [[Kuma–Manych Depression]]) and the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title=Asia | url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110518/Asia | encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online | year=2006 | location=Chicago | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is bounded on the east by the [[Pacific Ocean]], on the south by the [[Indian Ocean]] and on the north by the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Asia is subdivided into 48 countries, two of them ([[Russia]] and [[Turkey]]) having part of their land in Europe.

Asia has extremely diverse climates and geographic features. Climates range from arctic and subarctic in Siberia to tropical in southern India and Southeast Asia. It is moist across southeast sections, and dry across much of the interior. Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of Asia. The monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections, due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer. Southwestern sections of the continent are hot. Siberia is one of the coldest places in the Northern Hemisphere, and can act as a source of arctic air masses for North America. The most active place on Earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the Philippines and south of Japan. The [[Gobi Desert]] is in [[Mongolia]] and the [[Arabian Desert]] stretches across much of the Middle East. The [[Yangtze River]] in China is the longest river in the continent. The [[Himalayas]] between Nepal and China is the tallest mountain range in the world. Tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern Asia and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north.

===Climate change===

A survey carried out in 2010 by global risk analysis farm [[Maplecroft]] identified 16 countries that are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Each nation's vulnerability was calculated using 42 socio, economic and environmental indicators, which identified the likely climate change impacts during the next 30 years. The Asian countries of [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]] were among the 16 countries facing extreme risk from climate change. Some shifts are already occurring. For example, in tropical parts of India with a [[semi-arid climate]], the temperature increased by 0.4&amp;nbsp;°C between 1901 and 2003.
A 2013 study by the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) aimed to find science-based, pro-poor approaches and techniques that would enable Asia's agricultural systems to cope with climate change, while benefitting poor and vulnerable farmers. The study's recommendations ranged from improving the use of climate information in local planning and strengthening weather-based agro-advisory services, to stimulating diversification of rural household incomes and providing incentives to farmers to adopt natural resource conservation measures to enhance forest cover, replenish groundwater and use [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://exploreit.icrisat.org/sites/default/files/uploads/1378286859_PolicyBrief23.pdf ''Vulnerability to Climate Change: Adaptation Strategies and layers of Resilience''], [[ICRISAT]], Policy Brief No. 23, February 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

For several decades in the late twentieth century Japan was the largest economy in Asia and second-largest of any single nation in the world, after surpassing the [[Soviet Union]] (measured in net material product) in 1986 and Germany in 1968. (NB: A number of supernational economies are larger, such as the [[European Union]] (EU), the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) or [[APEC]]). This ended in 2010 when China overtook Japan to become the world's second largest economy.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Japan's GDP was almost as large (current exchange rate method) as that of the rest of Asia combined.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} In 1995, Japan's economy nearly equaled that of the USA as the largest economy in the world for a day, after the Japanese currency reached a record high of 79 [[Japanese yen|yen]]/US$.

Several trade blocs exist, with the most developed being the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]].

Asia is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin, and it is rich in natural resources, such as petroleum, forests, fish, water, rice, copper and silver. Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in the [[China]], [[Taiwan]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]], India, the [[Philippines]], and [[Singapore]]. Japan and South Korea continue to dominate in the area of [[multinational corporation]]s, but increasingly the PRC and India are making significant inroads. Many companies from Europe, North America, South Korea and Japan have operations in Asia's developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure.

The increased use of outsourcing has assisted the rise of India and the China as financial centers. Due to its large and extremely competitive information technology industry, India has become a major hub for outsourcing.

[[East Asia]] had by far the strongest overall [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) improvement of any region in the world, nearly doubling average HDI attainment over the past 40 years, according to the report’s analysis of health, education and income data. China, the second highest achiever in the world in terms of HDI improvement since
1970, is the only country on the &quot;Top 10 Movers&quot; list due to income rather than health or education achievements. Its per capita income increased a stunning 21-fold over the last four decades, also lifting hundreds of millions out of income poverty. Yet it was not among the region’s top performers in improving school enrolment and life expectancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNDP&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/PR6-HDR10-RegRBAP-E-rev5-sm.pdf |title=2010 Human Development Report: Asian countries lead development progress over 40 years |publisher=UNDP |accessdate=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;[[Nepal]], a South Asian country, emerges as one of the world’s fastest movers since 1970 mainly due to health and education achievements. Its present [[life expectancy]] is 25 years longer than in the 1970s. More than four of every five children of school age in Nepal now attend primary school, compared to just one in five 40 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNDP&quot;/&gt;
&lt;br&gt; Japan and South Korea ranked highest among the countries grouped on the HDI (number 11 and 12 in the world, which are in the &quot;very high human development&quot; category), followed by Hong Kong (21) and [[Singapore]] (27). [[Afghanistan]] (155) ranked lowest amongst Asian countries out of the 169 countries assessed.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNDP&quot;/&gt;

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Asia}}
Asia is home to several [[language family|language families]] and many [[language isolate]]s. Most Asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken. For instance, according to [[Ethnologue]], more than 600 languages are spoken in Indonesia, more than 800 languages spoken in India, and more than 100 are spoken in the Philippines. China has many languages and dialects in different provinces.

=== Religions ===

Many of the world's [[major religious groups|major religions]] have their origins in Asia. Asian mythology is complex and diverse. The story of the Great Flood for example, as presented to Christians in the Old Testament, is first found in [[Mesopotamian mythology]], in the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]''. [[Hindu mythology]] tells about an [[Avatar]] of the [[Vishnu|God Vishnu]] in the form of a [[Matsya|fish]] who warned [[Sraddhadeva Manu|Manu]] of a terrible flood. In ancient [[Chinese mythology]], [[Shan Hai Jing]], the Chinese ruler [[King Yu of Xia of China|Da Yu]], had to spend 10 years to control a deluge which swept out most of ancient China and was aided by the goddess [[Nüwa]] who literally fixed the broken sky through which huge rains were pouring.

==== Abrahamic ====
The [[Abrahamic religions]] of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Bahá'í Faith]] originated in West Asia. [[Judaism]], the oldest of the Abrahamic faiths, is practiced primarily in [[Israel]], the birthplace and historical homeland of the [[Jews|Hebrew nation]] which today consists equally of those [[Israelites]] who remained in [[Mizrahi Jews|Asia/North Africa]] and those who returned from [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]] in [[Ashkenazi Jews|Europe]], [[American Jews|North America]], and other regions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/jewpop.html |title=The Jewish Population of the World |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=1 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; though sizable communities continue to live abroad.

[[Christianity]] is also present throughout Asia. In the Philippines and [[East Timor]], Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion; it was introduced by the [[Spain|Spaniards]] and the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], respectively. In [[Armenia]], Cyprus, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and Asian Russia, [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] is the predominant religion. Various Christian [[Christian denomination|denominations]] have adherents in portions of the Middle East, as well as China and India. [[Saint Thomas Christians]] in [[India]] trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of [[Thomas the Apostle]] in the 1st century.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume 5 by Erwin Fahlbusch. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing - 2008, Page 285. ISBN 978-0-8028-2417-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islam]], which originated in [[Saudi Arabia]], is the largest and most widely spread religion in Asia. With 12.7% of the world Muslim population, the country currently with the largest Muslim population in the world is [[Indonesia]], followed by [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]]. [[Mecca]], [[Medina]] and to a lesser extent [[Jerusalem]] are the holiest cities for Islam in all the world. These religious sites attract large numbers of devotees from all over the world, particularly during the [[Hajj]] and [[Umrah]] seasons. [[Iran]] is the largest [[Shi'a]] country and [[Pakistan]] has the largest [[Ahmadiyya]] population.

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] originated in Asia, in Iran (Persia), and spread from there to the Ottoman Empire, Central Asia, India, and Burma during the lifetime of Bahá'u'lláh. Since the middle of the 20th century, growth has particularly occurred in other Asian countries, because Bahá'í activities in many Muslim countries has been severely [[Persecution of Bahá'ís|suppressed]] by authorities. [[Lotus Temple]] is a big Baha'i Temple in India.

==== Indian and East Asian religions ====

Almost all Asian religions have philosophical character and Asian philosophical traditions cover a large spectrum of philosophical thoughts and writings. [[Indian philosophy]] includes [[Hindu philosophy]] and [[Buddhist philosophy]]. They include elements of nonmaterial pursuits, whereas another school of thought from India, [[Cārvāka]], preached the enjoyment of the material world. The religions of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]] originated in India, South Asia. In East Asia, particularly in China and Japan, [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] and [[Zen|Zen Buddhism]] took shape.

As of 2012, Hinduism has around 1.1 billion adherents. The faith represents around 25% of Asia's population and is the second largest religion in Asia. However, it is mostly concentrated in South Asia. Over 80% of the populations of both India and Nepal adhere to Hinduism, alongside significant communities in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and [[Bali]], Indonesia. Many overseas Indians in countries such as Burma, Singapore and Malaysia also adhere to Hinduism.

Buddhism has a great following in mainland Southeast Asia and East Asia. Buddhism is the religion of the majority of the populations of [[Cambodia]] (96%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cb.html |title=CIA&amp;nbsp;— The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=20 December 2010| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20101229001224/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cb.html| archivedate= 29 December 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thailand]] (95%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/th.html |title=CIA&amp;nbsp;— The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=20 December 2010| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20101229000203/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/th.html| archivedate= 29 December 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Burma]] (80%-89%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bm.html |title=CIA&amp;nbsp;— The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=20 December 2010| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20101229013140/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bm.html| archivedate= 29 December 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Japan]] (36%–96%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ja.html |title=CIA&amp;nbsp;— The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=20 December 2010| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20101228224107/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ja.html| archivedate= 28 December 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bhutan]] (75%-84%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bt.html |title=CIA&amp;nbsp;— The World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=20 December 2010| archiveurl= //web.archive.org/web/20101228202246/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bt.html| archivedate= 28 December 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sri Lanka]] (70%),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.lk/PopHouSat/CPH2011/index.php?fileName=pop43&amp;gp=Activities&amp;tpl=3
