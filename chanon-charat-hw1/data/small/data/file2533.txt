{{Campaignbox Waterloo}}
The '''Battle of Waterloo''' was fought on Sunday, 18 June 1815, near [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]] in present-day [[Belgium]], then part of the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]]. A [[Army of the North (France)|French army]] under the command of [[Napoleon]] was defeated by the armies of the [[Seventh Coalition]], comprising an Anglo-allied army under the command of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] combined with a [[Prussia]]n army under the command of [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher|Gebhard von Blücher]].

Upon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and began to mobilize armies. Two large forces under Wellington and Blücher assembled close to the north-eastern border of France. Napoleon chose to attack in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a coordinated invasion of France with other members of the coalition. Waterloo was the decisive engagement of the [[Waterloo Campaign]] and Napoleon's last. According to Wellington, the battle was &quot;the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[q:Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wikiquote:Wellington]] citing ''Creevey Papers'', ch. x, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt;  The defeat at Waterloo ended Napoleon's rule as [[Emperor of the French]], and marked the end of his [[Hundred Days]] return from exile.

Two days before the battle, Blücher's Prussian army had been defeated by the French at [[Battle of Ligny|Ligny]]. Wellington decided to offer battle upon learning that the Prussian army had regrouped and was able to march to his support. Wellington's army, positioned across the Brussels road on the [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Mont-Saint-Jean]] [[escarpment]], withstood repeated attacks by the French in a defensive mode, until, in the evening, the Prussians arrived in force and broke through Napoleon's right flank. At that moment, Wellington's Anglo-allied army counter-attacked and drove the French army in disorder from the field. Pursuing coalition forces entered France and restored [[Louis XVIII of France|King Louis&amp;nbsp;XVIII]] to the French throne. Napoleon abdicated, eventually surrendering to Captain [[Frederick Lewis Maitland (Royal Navy officer)|Maitland]] of [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS ''Bellerophon'']], part of the British blockade, and was exiled to [[Saint Helena]] where he died in 1821.

The battlefield is located in Belgium, about {{convert|15|km|mi}} south of [[Brussels]], and about {{convert|2|km|mi}} from the town of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]]. The site of the battlefield today is dominated by a large monument, the [[Lion's Mound]]. As this mound was constructed from earth taken from the battlefield itself, the contemporary topography of the battlefield near the mound has not been preserved.

Napoleon was forced to leave 20,000 men in Western France to reduce a royalist insurrection.]]
On 13 March 1815, six days before Napoleon reached Paris, the powers at the [[Congress of Vienna]] [[s:Declaration at the Congress of Vienna|declared him an outlaw]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.lib.brown.edu/napoleon/time7.html Timeline: The Congress of Vienna, the Hundred Days, and Napoleon's Exile on St Helena], Center of Digital Initiatives, [[Brown University]] Library&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], and [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] mobilised armies to defeat Napoleon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hamilton-Williams|1993|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon knew that once his attempts at dissuading one or more of the [[Seventh Coalition]] allies from invading France had failed, his only chance of remaining in power was to attack before the coalition mobilised. If he could destroy the existing coalition forces south of Brussels before they were reinforced, he might be able to drive the British back to the sea and knock the Prussians out of the war. An additional consideration was that there were many French-speaking sympathisers in Belgium and a French victory might trigger a friendly revolution there. Also, the British troops in Belgium were largely second-line troops; most of the veterans of the [[Peninsular War]] had been sent to the United States and Canada to fight the [[War of 1812]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chandler|1966|pp=1016, 1017, 1093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NapoleonsHeadquartersAtWaterloo.jpg|thumb|Napoleon's headquarters during the battle, the Caillou (&quot;Pebble&quot;) Farm]]
Wellington's initial dispositions were intended to counter the threat of Napoleon enveloping the Coalition armies by moving through [[Mons]] to the south-west of Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Siborne&lt;!--W--&gt;|1990|p=82}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This would have cut Wellington's communications with his base at [[Ostend]], but would have pushed his army closer to Blücher's. Napoleon manipulated Wellington's fear of this loss of his supply chain from the channel ports with false intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|2005|pp= 136–160}}&lt;/ref&gt; By June, Napoleon had raised a total army strength of about 300 thousand men. The force at his disposal at Waterloo was less than one third that size, but they were nearly all loyal and experienced soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Herold|1967|pp= 53, 58, 110.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He divided his army into a left wing commanded by [[Michel Ney|Marshal Ney]], a right wing commanded by [[Emmanuel, marquis de Grouchy|Marshal Grouchy]] and a reserve under his command (although all three elements remained close enough to support one another). Crossing the frontier near [[Charleroi]] before dawn on 15 June, the French rapidly overran Coalition outposts, securing Napoleon's &quot;central position&quot; between Wellington's and Blücher's armies.

Only very late on the night of 15 June, was Wellington certain that the Charleroi attack was the main French thrust. In the early hours of 16 June, at the [[Duchess of Richmond's ball]] in Brussels, he received a dispatch from the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] and was shocked by the speed of Napoleon's advance. He hastily ordered his army to concentrate on [[Quatre Bras]], where the Prince of Orange, with the brigade of [[Bernhard Carl of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar]], was holding a tenuous position against the soldiers of Ney's left wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Longford|1971|p=508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ney's orders were to secure the crossroads of Quatre Bras, so that, if necessary, he could later swing east and reinforce Napoleon.

Napoleon moved against the concentrated Prussian army first. On 16 June, with a part of the reserve and the right wing of the army, he attacked and defeated Blücher's Prussians at the [[Battle of Ligny]]. The Prussian centre gave way under more heavy French assaults but the flanks held their ground. Ney, meanwhile, found the crossroads of [[Battle of Quatre Bras|Quatre Bras]] lightly held by the Prince of Orange, who repelled Ney's initial attacks but was gradually driven back by overwhelming numbers of French troops. Firstly reinforcements and then Wellington arrived. He took command and drove Ney back, securing the crossroads by early evening, too late to send help to the Prussians, who were defeated at the Battle of Ligny on the same day. The Prussian defeat made Wellington's position at Quatre Bras untenable, so the next day he withdrew northwards, to a defensive position he had [[reconnaissance|reconnoitred]] the previous year—the low [[ridge]] of Mont-Saint-Jean, south of the village of [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]] and the [[Sonian Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Longford|1971|p=527}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prussian retreat from Ligny went uninterrupted and seemingly unnoticed, by the French.&lt;ref name=Chesney-136&gt;{{Harvnb|Chesney|1907|p=136}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of their rearguard units held their positions until about midnight and some elements did not move out until the following morning, ignored by the French.&lt;ref name=Chesney-136/&gt; Crucially, the Prussians did not retreat to the east, along their own lines of communication. Instead, they too fell back northwards—parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within supporting distance and in communication with him throughout. The Prussians rallied on [[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Bülow|Bülow]]{{'}}s IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny and was in a strong position south of [[Wavre]].&lt;ref name=Chesney-136/&gt;

Napoleon, with the reserves, made a late start on 17 June and joined Ney at Quatre Bras at 13:00 to attack Wellington's army but found the position empty. The French pursued Wellington but the result was only a brief cavalry skirmish in [[Genappe]] just as torrential rain set in for the night. Before leaving Ligny, Napoleon ordered Grouchy, commander of the right wing, to follow up the retreating Prussians with 33,000 men. A late start, uncertainty about the direction the Prussians had taken and the vagueness of the orders given to him meant that Grouchy was too late to prevent the Prussian army reaching Wavre, from where it could march to support Wellington. By the end of 17 June, Wellington's army had arrived at its position at Waterloo, with the main body of Napoleon's army following. Blücher's army was gathering in and around Wavre, around {{convert|8|mi|km}} to the east of the city.

==Armies==

{{Main|Order of Battle of the Waterloo Campaign}}
Three armies were involved in the battle: Napoleon's ''Armée du Nord''; a multinational army under Wellington; and a Prussian army under Blücher.

The French army of around 69,000 consisted of 48,000 infantry, 14,000 cavalry, and 7,000 artillery with 250 guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=75}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=68}} gives 73,000.&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon had used conscription to fill the ranks of the French army throughout his rule, but he did not conscript men for the 1815 campaign. All his troops were veterans of at least one campaign who had returned more or less voluntarily to the colours. The cavalry in particular was both numerous and formidable, and included fourteen regiments of armoured [[heavy cavalry]] and seven of highly versatile [[lancers]].

Wellington claimed that he himself had &quot;an infamous army, very weak and ill-equipped, and a very inexperienced Staff&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Longford|1971|p=485}}&lt;/ref&gt; His troops consisted of 67,000 men: 50,000 infantry, 11,000 cavalry, and 6,000 artillery with 150 guns. Of these, 25,000 were British, with another 6,000 from the [[King's German Legion]]. All of the [[British Army]] troops were regular soldiers but only 7,000 of them were [[Peninsular War]] veterans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Longford|1971|p=484}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there were 17,000 Dutch and Belgian troops, 11,000 from [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]], 6,000 from [[Brunswick-Lüneburg#Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Brunswick]], and 3,000 from [[Nassau (duchy)|Nassau]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barbero 2005 75–76&quot;/&gt;

[[File:YoungwilliamII.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Prince of Orange, commander of the Anglo-allied [[Order of Battle of the Waterloo Campaign#I Corps 2|I Corps]].]]
Many of the troops in the Coalition armies were inexperienced.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;An artillery captain, Mercer, thought the Brunswickers &quot;perfect children&quot; {{Harv|Mercer|1870|loc=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;On 13 June, the commandant at [[Ath]] requested powder and cartridges as members of a Hanoverian reserve regiment there had never yet fired a shot {{Harv|Longford|1971|p=486}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch army had been re-established in 1815, following the earlier defeat of Napoleon. With the exception of the British and some from Hanover and Brunswick who had fought with the British army in Spain, many of the professional soldiers in the Coalition armies had spent some of their time in the French army or in armies allied to the Napoleonic regime. Barbero states that in this heterogeneous army the difference between British and ''foreign'' troops did not prove significant under fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2006|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wellington was also acutely short of heavy cavalry, having only seven British and three Dutch regiments. The [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] imposed many of his staff officers on Wellington, including his second-in-command, the [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Earl of Uxbridge]]. Uxbridge commanded the cavalry and had [[Blank cheque|carte blanche]] from Wellington to commit these forces at his discretion. Wellington stationed a further 17,000 troops at [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]], {{convert|8|mi|km}} away to the west; they were not recalled to participate in the battle but were to serve as a fallback position should the battle be lost.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} They were mostly composed of Dutch troops under [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]]'s younger brother [[Prince Frederik of the Netherlands]]. According to Hofschröer, the best Dutch troops were at Halle and he questions the reasons for their placement at Halle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The straight line distance from Halle to Braine-l'Alleud, Wellington's far right flank is nearly the same as the straight line distance from Wavre to Frichermont, Wellington's far left flank, around {{convert|8|mi|km}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prussian army was in the throes of reorganisation. In 1815, the former Reserve regiments, Legions, and ''Freikorps'' volunteer formations from the wars of 1813–1814 were in the process of being absorbed into the line, along with many ''[[Landwehr]]'' (militia) regiments. The ''Landwehr'' were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in Belgium. The Prussian cavalry were in a similar state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|2005|p=59}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance&amp;nbsp;– guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle. Off-setting these handicaps, however, the Prussian Army did have excellent and professional leadership in its General Staff organisation. These officers came from four schools developed for this purpose and thus worked to a common standard of training. This system was in marked contrast to the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army. This staff system ensured that before Ligny, three-quarters of the Prussian army concentrated for battle at 24 hours notice. After Ligny, the Prussian army, although defeated, was able to realign its supply train, reorganise itself, and intervene decisively on the Waterloo battlefield within 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|2005|pp=60–62}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Two and a half Prussian army corps, or 48,000 men, were engaged at Waterloo&amp;nbsp;– two brigades under [[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Bülow|Friedrich von Bülow]], commander of IV Corps, attacked [[Georges Mouton|Lobau]] at 16:30, while [[Hans Ernst Karl von Zieten|Zieten's]] I Corps and parts of [[Georg Dubislav Ludwig von Pirch|Georg von Pirch]]{{'}}s II Corps engaged at about 18:00.

==Battlefield==
[[Image:Belgique Butte du Lion dit de Waterloo.jpg|thumb|right|The famous ''morne plaine'' described by [[Victor Hugo]] and the [[Lion's Mound]].]]
The Waterloo position was a strong one. It consisted of a long ridge running east-west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along the crest of the ridge ran the [[Ohain, Belgium|Ohain]] road, a deep [[sunken lane]]. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was a large elm tree that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road. Using the [[Reverse slope defence|reverse slope]], as he had many times previously, Wellington concealed his strength from the French, with the exception of his skirmishers and artillery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|pp=78,79}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The length of front of the battlefield was also relatively short at {{convert|2.5|mi|km}}. This allowed Wellington to draw up his forces in depth, which he did in the centre and on the right, all the way towards the village of [[Braine-l'Alleud]], in the expectation that the Prussians would reinforce his left during the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=80}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In front of the ridge, there were three positions that could be fortified. On the extreme right were the château, garden, and orchard of [[Hougoumont (farmhouse)|Hougoumont]]. This was a large and well-built country house, initially hidden in trees. The house faced north along a sunken, covered lane (usually described by the British as &quot;the hollow-way&quot;) along which it could be supplied. On the extreme left was the hamlet of Papelotte. Both Hougoumont and Papelotte were fortified and garrisoned, and thus anchored Wellington's flanks securely. Papelotte also commanded the road to Wavre that the Prussians would use to send reinforcements to Wellington's position. On the western side of the main road, and in front of the rest of Wellington's line, was the farmhouse and orchard of [[La Haye Sainte]], which was garrisoned with 400 light infantry of the [[King's German Legion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=149}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the opposite side of the road was a disused sand quarry, where the [[95th Rifles]] were posted as sharpshooters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Parry|1900|p=58}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
This position presented a formidable challenge to any attacking force. Any attempt to turn Wellington's right would entail taking the entrenched Hougoumont position; any attack on his right centre would mean the attackers would have to march between [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilading fire]] from Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte. On the left, any attack would also be enfiladed by fire from La Haye Sainte and its adjoining sandpit, and any attempt at turning the left flank would entail fighting through the streets and hedgerows of Papelotte, and some very wet ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|pp=141,235}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French army formed on the slopes of another ridge to the south. Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the right was I Corps under [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|d'Erlon]] with 16,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under [[Honoré Charles Reille|Reille]] with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south of the inn ''[[La Belle Alliance]]'' were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]], and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|pp=83–85}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the right rear of the French position was the substantial village of [[Plancenoit]], and at the extreme right, the ''Bois de Paris'' wood. Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, where he could see the entire battlefield, but moved to a position near ''La Belle Alliance'' early in the afternoon. Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=91}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparation===
Wellington rose at around 02:00 or 03:00 on 18 June, and wrote letters until dawn. He had earlier written to Blücher confirming that he would give battle at Mont-Saint-Jean if Blücher could provide him with at least one corps; otherwise he would retreat towards Brussels. At a late-night council, Blücher's chief of staff, [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau]], had been distrustful of Wellington's strategy, but Blücher persuaded him that they should march to join Wellington's army. In the morning Wellington duly received a reply from Blücher, promising to support him with three corps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Longford|1971|pp=535,536}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 06:00 Wellington was in the field supervising the deployment of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under Bülow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it was in the best shape, not having been involved in the [[Battle of Ligny]]. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and Bülow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88&amp;nbsp;artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along Bülow's intended route. As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. Bülow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=141}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Napoleon breakfasted off silver plate at ''Le Caillou'', the house where he had spent the night. When [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] suggested that Grouchy should be recalled to join the main force, Napoleon said, &quot;Just because you have all been beaten by Wellington, you think he's a good general. I tell you Wellington is a bad general, the English are bad troops, and this affair is nothing more than eating breakfast&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Longford|1971|p=547}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Napoleon's surprisingly dismissive statements should not be taken at face value, given the Emperor's maxim that &quot;in war, morale is everything&quot; and that praising the enemy is always wrong, as it reduces one's morale. Indeed, he had been seen engaging in such pre-battle, morale-boosting harangues on a number of occasions in the past and on the morning of the battle of Waterloo he had to deal with his chief of staff's pessimism and nervousness and had to respond to several persistent and almost defeatist objections from some of his senior generals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2001|pp=163–166}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, being told by his brother, [[Jérôme Bonaparte|Jerome]], of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British officers at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would be dealt with by Grouchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=73}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at ''Le Caillou'' had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Blücher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2001|p=xxxii}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Napoleon.Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Battle of Mont-Saint-Jean]]]]
Napoleon had delayed the start of the battle owing to the sodden ground, which would have made manoeuvring cavalry and artillery difficult. In addition, many of his forces had [[bivouac shelter|bivouacked]] well to the south of ''La Belle Alliance''. At 10:00, in response to a dispatch he had received from Grouchy six hours earlier, he sent a reply telling Grouchy to &quot;head for Wavre [to Grouchy's north] in order to draw near to us [to the west of Grouchy]&quot; and then &quot;push before him&quot; the Prussians to arrive at Waterloo &quot;as soon as possible&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Longford|1971|p=548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 11:00, Napoleon drafted his general order: Reille's Corps on the left and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward position on the ridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bonaparte|1869|pp=292,293}}&lt;/ref&gt; To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves,{{sfn|Fletcher|1994|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=US-QQxjHnn8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 20]}} since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A ''[[Grand Battery|grande batterie]]'' of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|pp=95–98}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Andrieux - La bataille de Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Clément-Auguste Andrieux]]'s 1852 ''The Battle of Waterloo'']]
The historian Andrew Roberts notes that &quot;It is a curious fact about the Battle of Waterloo that no one is absolutely certain when it actually began&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2005|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wellington recorded in his dispatches that at &quot;about ten o'clock [Napoleon] commenced a furious attack upon our post at Hougoumont&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wellesley|1815|loc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources state that the attack began around 11:30.{{efn|&quot;The hour at which Waterloo began, though there were 150,000&amp;nbsp;actors in the great tragedy, was long a matter of dispute. The Duke of Wellington puts it at 10:00. General Alava says half-past eleven, Napoleon and Drouet say noon, and Ney 13:00. Lord Hill may be credited with having settled this minute question of fact. He took two watches with him into the fight, one a stop-watch, and he marked with it the sound of the first shot fired, and this evidence is now accepted as proving that the first flash of red flame which marked the opening of the world-shaking tragedy of Waterloo took place at exactly ten minutes to twelve&quot; {{Harv|Fitchett|2006|loc=Chapter: King-making Waterloo}}. &quot;...watches had to be set by solar time, this meant that it was rare for two watches to agree... For example, on 9 June, ... the French I Corps had been at Lille, while the IV Corps was at Metz. Assuming an officer had set his watch at noon and then meticulously wound it twice a day but not reset it during the approach march, by the time the two corps reached the vicinity of Waterloo, the I Corps officer's watch would have read 12:40 p.m. at a time when the IV Corps officer's read 11:20 a.m., and it was noon at Waterloo. This is an extreme example, and unlikely to have actually been the case, but it demonstrates the problem quite well&quot; {{harv|Nofi|1998|p=182}}.}} The house and its immediate environs were defended by four light companies of [[Foot Guards|Guards]], and the wood and park by Hanoverian ''[[Jäger (military)|Jäger]]'' and the 1/2nd&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;That is, the 1st battalion of the 2nd Regiment. Among Prussian regiments, &quot;F/12th&quot; denoted the fusilier battalion of the 12th Regiment.&lt;/ref&gt; Nassau.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|pp=113–114}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The initial attack by Bauduin's brigade emptied the wood and park, but was driven back by heavy British artillery fire, and cost Bauduin his life. As the British guns were distracted by a duel with French artillery, a second attack by Soye's brigade and what had been Bauduin's succeeded in reaching the north gate of the house. Sous-Lieutenant Legro, a French officer broke the gate down with an axe. Some French troops managed to enter the courtyard. The 2nd [[Coldstream Guards]] and [[Scots Guards|2/3rd Foot Guards]] arrived to help. There was a fierce melee, and the British managed to close the gate on the French troops streaming in. The Frenchmen trapped in the courtyard were all killed. Only a young drummer boy was spared.

Fighting continued around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings were heavily invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended the house and the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=Barbero298&gt;Seeing the flames, Wellington sent a note to the house's commander stating that he must hold his position whatever the cost {{Harv|Barbero|2005|p=298}}.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers. Eventually they were relieved by the [[71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot|71st Foot]], a British infantry regiment. Adam's brigade was further reinforced by [[Hugh Halkett|Hugh Halkett's]] 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille. Hougoumont held out until the end of the battle.

{{quote|I had occupied that post with a detachment from General Byng's brigade of Guards, which was in position in its rear; and it was some time under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel MacDonald, and afterwards of Colonel Home; and I am happy to add that it was maintained, throughout the day, with the utmost gallantry by these brave troops, notwithstanding the repeated efforts of large bodies of the enemy to obtain possession of it.|Wellington|&lt;ref name=Booth-10&gt;{{Harvnb|Booth|1815|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|When I reached Lloyd's abandoned guns, I stood near them for about a minute to contemplate the scene: it was grand beyond description. Hougoumont and its wood sent up a broad flame through the dark masses of smoke that overhung the field; beneath this cloud the French were indistinctly visible. Here a waving mass of long red feathers could be seen; there, gleams as from a sheet of steel showed that the cuirassiers were moving; 400&amp;nbsp;cannon were belching forth fire and death on every side; the roaring and shouting were indistinguishably commixed—together they gave me an idea of a labouring volcano. Bodies of infantry and cavalry were pouring down on us, and it was time to leave contemplation, so I moved towards our columns, which were standing up in square.|Major Macready, Light Division, 30th British Regiment, Halkett's brigade|&lt;ref name=Creasy-XV&gt;{{Harvnb|Creasy|1877|loc=[http://www.standin.se/fifteen15a.htm Chapter XV]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The fighting at Hougoumont has often been characterised as a diversionary attack to draw in Wellington's reserves which escalated into an all-day battle and drew in French reserves instead.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{Harvnb|Longford|1971|pp=552–554}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact there is a good case to believe that both Napoleon and Wellington thought that holding Hougoumont was key to winning the battle. Hougoumont was a part of the battlefield that Napoleon could see clearly,{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=298}} and he continued to direct resources towards it and its surroundings all afternoon (33&amp;nbsp;battalions in all, 14,000&amp;nbsp;troops). Similarly, though the house never contained a large number of troops, Wellington devoted 21&amp;nbsp;battalions (12,000&amp;nbsp;troops) over the course of the afternoon in keeping the hollow way open to allow fresh troops and ammunition to reach the buildings. He moved several artillery batteries from his hard-pressed centre to support Hougoumont,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|pp=305,306}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and later stated that &quot;the success of the battle turned upon closing the gates at Hougoumont&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2005|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First French infantry attack===
[[Image:Battle of Waterloo.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of the battle. [[Napoleon]]'s units are in blue, [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]]'s in red, [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher|Blücher]]'s in grey.]]

The 80 guns of Napoleon's ''grande batterie'' drew up in the centre. These opened fire at 11:50, according to [[Rowland Hill, 1st Viscount Hill|Lord Hill]] (commander of the Anglo-Allied II Corps),&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;&quot;Lord Hill may be credited with having settled this minute question of fact. He took two watches with him into the fight, one a stop-watch, and he marked with it the sound of the first shot fired&amp;nbsp;... At ten minutes to twelve the first heavy gun rang sullenly from the French ridge&quot; {{Harv|Fitchett|2006|loc=Chapter: King-making Waterloo}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while other sources put the time between noon and 13:30.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=131}} The ''grande batterie'' was too far back to aim accurately, and the only other troops they could see were skirmishers of the regiments of Kempt and Pack, and [[Hendrik George de Perponcher Sedlnitsky|Perponcher's]] 2nd Dutch division (the others were employing Wellington's characteristic &quot;[[reverse slope defence]]&quot;).{{sfn||Hamilton-Williams|1993|p=286}}&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The entire 1st brigade of the 2nd Dutch division, that had been on the forward slope during the night, withdrew to a position behind the ridge between the regiments of Kempt and Pack around 12:00 {{Harv|Bas|1909|pp=332–333}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, the bombardment caused a large number of casualties. Though some projectiles buried themselves in the soft soil, most found their marks on the reverse slope of the ridge. The bombardment forced the cavalry of the Union Brigade (in third line) to move to its left, as did the Scots Greys, to reduce their casualty rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hamilton-Williams|1993|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At about 13:00, Napoleon saw the first columns of Prussians around the village of [[Lasne-Chapelle-Saint-Lambert]], four or five miles (three hours march for an army) away from his right flank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=136}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon's reaction was to have Marshal Soult send a message to Grouchy telling him to come towards the battlefield and attack the arriving Prussians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=145}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Grouchy, however, had been executing Napoleon's previous orders to follow the Prussians &quot;with your sword against his back&quot; towards Wavre, and was by then too far away to reach Waterloo. Grouchy was advised by his subordinate, [[Étienne Maurice Gérard|Gérard]], to &quot;march to the sound of the guns&quot;, but stuck to his orders and engaged the Prussian III Corps rear guard under the command of [[Lieutenant-General]] [[Baron]] [[Johann von Thielmann]] at the [[Battle of Wavre]]. Moreover, Soult's letter ordering Grouchy to move quickly to join Napoleon and attack Bülow wouldn't actually reach Grouchy until after 20:00.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

A little after 13:00, I Corps' attack began. D'Erlon, like Ney, had encountered Wellington in Spain, and was aware of the British commander's favoured tactic of using massed short-range musketry to drive off infantry columns. Rather than use the usual nine-deep French columns deployed abreast of one another, therefore, each division advanced in closely spaced battalion lines behind one another. This allowed them to concentrate their fire,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=165}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but it did not leave room for them to change formation.

The formation was initially effective. Its leftmost division, under [[François-Xavier Donzelot]], advanced on La Haye Sainte. The farmhouse was defended by the [[King's German Legion]]. While one French battalion engaged the defenders from the front, the following battalions fanned out to either side and, with the support of several squadrons of [[cuirassiers]], succeeded in isolating the farmhouse. The King's German Legion resolutely defended the farmhouse. Each time the French tried to scale the walls the outnumbered Germans somehow held them off. The Prince of Orange saw that La Haye Sainte had been cut off and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the Hanoverian Lüneberg Battalion in line. Cuirassiers concealed in a fold in the ground caught and destroyed it in minutes and then rode on past La Haye Sainte, almost to the crest of the ridge, where they covered d'Erlon's left flank as his attack developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=289–293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At about 13:30, d'Erlon started to advance his three other divisions, some 14,000&amp;nbsp;men over a front of about {{convert|1,000|m|yd|abbr=off}}, against Wellington's left wing. At the point they aimed for they faced 6,000&amp;nbsp;men: the first line consisted of the Dutch 1st &quot;[[Brigade van Bylandt]]&quot; of the 2nd Dutch division, flanked by the British brigades of Kempt and Pack on either side. The second line consisted of British and Hanoverian troops under [[Sir Thomas Picton]], who were lying down in dead ground behind the ridge. All had suffered badly at Quatre Bras. In addition, the Bijlandt brigade had been ordered to deploy its skirmishers in the hollow road and on the forward slope. The rest of the brigade was lying down just behind the road.&lt;ref&gt;Website of current Dutch historian&lt;!--s: Erwin van Muilwijk: [http://home.tiscali.nl/erwinmuilwijk/index.htm Tiscali.nl], and... website no longer contains the referenced sources--&gt; Marco Bijl: [http://www.8militia.net/ 8militia.net];{{Harvnb|Eenens|1879| pp=14–30, 131–198}}; De Jongh, W.A.: Veldtocht van den Jare 1815, Historisch verhaal; in De Nieuwe Militaire Spectator (Nijmegen 1866), pp. 13–27.(This is the original account of Colonel de Jongh, commander of the Dutch 8th Militia.

Van Zuylen van Nijevelt was the chief of staff of the 2nd division and located right behind the van Bijlandt brigade during the whole day ({{Harvnb|Bas|1909|pp=134–136}}(vol.2)). He wrote a 32 page report, right after the battle. This report forms the basis of most of the other literature mentioned here: see {{Harvnb|Bas|1909|pp=289–352}}(vol.3). [http://books.google.com/books?id=V5wLAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA286&amp;dq=%22De+Bas%22+++Zuylen&amp;lr=&amp;cd=16#v=onepage&amp;q=%22De%20Bas%22%20%20%20Zuylen&amp;f=false Google Books]; Boulger has an English translation of the report {{Harv|Boulger|1901}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the moment these skirmishers were rejoining their parent battalions, the brigade was ordered to its feet and started to return fire. On the left of the brigade, where the 7th Dutch Militia stood, a &quot;few files were shot down and an opening in the line thus occurred.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Van Zuylen report {{Harvnb|Bas|1909|pp=338–339}}(vol. 3)&lt;/ref&gt; The battalion had no reserves and was unable to close the gap.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The brigade's losses were very heavy: one French volley at point blank range decimated the 7th and 8th Militia, who had most of their officers killed or wounded, the brigade commander Bijlandt being one of the wounded who had to be evacuated. The two battalions lost their command structure in one stroke. The total of casualties for the whole brigade for the day was around 800 killed and wounded {{Harv|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=310–311}}.&lt;/ref&gt; D'Erlon's troops pushed through this gap in the line and the remaining battalions in the Bylandt brigade (8th Dutch Militia and Belgian 7th Line Battalion) were forced to retreat to the square of the 5th Dutch Militia, which was in reserve between Picton's troops, about 100 paces to the rear. There they regrouped under the command of Colonel [[Pieter Hendrik van Zuylen van Nijevelt|Van Zuylen van Nijevelt]].&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Van Zuylen report; he refers to himself as &quot;the chief-of-staff&quot; ({{Harvnb|Bas|1909|pp=338–339}}(vol. 3)).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Some of the retreating troops panicked and fled. This was not to be wondered at in the circumstances. The British troops of the 1/95th battalion, also under great pressure from the French, did the same at the time. This flight did not involve the whole of the Dutch battalions, as has been asserted by some historians. Van Zuylen rallied 400 men, according to his estimate, who were ready to join the counterattack and even captured two French fanions ({{Harvnb|Bas|1909|pp=338–341}}(vol. 3); {{Harvnb|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=293–295}})&lt;/ref&gt; A moment later the Prince of Orange ordered a counterattack, which actually occurred around 10 minutes later. Bylandt was wounded and retired off the field, passing command of the Brigade to Lt. Kol. De Jongh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pawly|2001|pp=37–43}}; The following letters are used: the accounts of General Kempt, Calvert of the 32nd infantry, Cruikshank of the 79th, Winchester &amp; Hope of the 92nd, Evans (Ponsonby Cavalry brigade) and Clark Kennedy of the Royal Dragoons {{harv|Glover|2004}}. These are the only letters that actually state some details about the Dutch and Belgian troops.&lt;/ref&gt;

D'Erlon's men ascended the slope and advanced on the sunken road, ''Chemin d'Ohain'', that ran from behind La Haye Sainte and continued east. It was lined on both sides by thick hedges, with [[Willem Frederik van Bylandt|Bylandt's]] brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the center, [[François-Xavier Donzelot|Donzelot's]] division had pushed back the Bylandt. On the right of the French advance was Marcognet's division lead by Grenier's brigade consisting of the ''45e Régiment de Ligne'' and followed by the ''25e Régiment de Ligne'', somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the ''21e'' and ''45e'' regiments. Opposing them on the other side of the road was [[Denis Pack|Pack's]] 9th Brigade consisting of three Scottish regiments: the [[Royal Scots]], the 42nd [[Black Watch]], the 92nd Gordons and the [[44th Foot]] totaling something over 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2006|pp=134 to 138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French advance drove in the British skirmishers and reached the sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line formation for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way under the pressure of numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=296–297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French ''45e Ligne'' burst through the hedge cheering. Along the sunken road, the French were forcing the Allies back, the British line was dispersing, and at two o'clock in the afternoon Napoleon was winning the Battle of Waterloo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2006|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charge of the British heavy cavalry===

{{quote|Our officers of cavalry have acquired a trick of galloping at everything. They never consider the situation, never think of manoeuvring before an enemy, and never keep back or provide a reserve.|Wellington|&lt;ref name=&quot;WellingtonCavalry&quot; /&gt;}}

[[File:Scotland Forever!.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Charge of the Scots Greys at Waterloo.]]

At this crucial juncture, Uxbridge ordered his two brigades of British heavy cavalry—formed unseen behind the ridge—to charge in support of the hard-pressed infantry. The [[1st Cavalry Brigade (United Kingdom)|1st Brigade]], known as the Household Brigade, commanded by Major-General [[Lord Edward Somerset]], consisted of guards regiments: the [[1st Regiment of Life Guards|1st]] and [[2nd Regiment of Life Guards|2nd Life Guards]], the [[Royal Horse Guards]] (the Blues), and the [[1st King's Dragoon Guards|1st (King's) Dragoon Guards]]. The [[2nd Cavalry Brigade (United Kingdom)|2nd Brigade]], also known as the Union Brigade, commanded by Major-General [[William Ponsonby (British Army officer)|Sir William Ponsonby]], was so called as it consisted of an English, the [[1st The Royal Dragoons|1st (The Royals)]]; a Scottish, [[Royal Scots Greys|2nd ('Scots Greys')]]; and an Irish, [[6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons|6th (Inniskilling)]]; regiment of heavy dragoons.&lt;ref&gt;Adkin, p.217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anglesey, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Knötel IV, 04.jpg|left|thumb|upright|British Household Cavalry charging]]

More than 20&amp;nbsp;years of warfare had eroded the numbers of suitable cavalry mounts available on the European continent; this resulted in the British heavy cavalry entering the 1815 campaign with the finest horses of any contemporary cavalry arm. They also received excellent mounted swordsmanship training. They were, however, inferior to the French in manoeuvring in large formations, cavalier in attitude, and unlike the infantry had scant experience of warfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;WellingtonCavalry&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2006|pp=140–142 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Scots Greys, for example, had not been in action since 1795.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grant|1972|p=17}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wellington, they had little tactical ability or common sense.&lt;ref name=&quot;WellingtonCavalry&quot;/&gt;

The two brigades had a combined field strength of about 2,000 (2,651 official strength); they charged with the 47-year-old Uxbridge leading them and a very inadequate number of squadrons held in reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=188}}. The Royal Horse Guards (2 squadrons) were in reserve for the Household Brigade (9 or 10 squadrons strong) but the Union Brigade (9 squadrons) had no reserve (''Letter 5'', {{harvnb|Siborne&lt;!--HT--&gt;|1891|pp=7–10}}; ''Letter 16'' {{harvnb|Glover|2004}}). The total may have been 18&amp;nbsp;squadrons as there is an uncertainty in the sources as to whether the King's Dragoon Guards fielded three or four squadrons. Uxbridge implies 4 squadrons (''Letter 5'' {{harvnb|Siborne&lt;!--HT--&gt;|1891|pp=7–10}}), however, Capt. Naylor of the King's implies 3 when he states he commanded the centre squadron of the regiment (''Letter 21'', {{harvnb|Siborne&lt;!--HT--&gt;|1891|pp=46–47}}).&lt;/ref&gt;  There is evidence that Uxbridge gave an order, the morning of the battle, to all cavalry brigade commanders to commit their commands on their own initiative, as direct orders from himself might not always be forthcoming, and to &quot;support movements to their front&quot;.{{sfn|Glover|2004|p=''Letter 16: Frederick Stovin (ADC to Sir Thomas Picton)''}} It appears that Uxbridge expected the brigades of [[Sir John Ormsby Vandeleur]], [[Hussey Vivian, 1st Baron Vivian|Hussey Vivian]] and the Dutch cavalry to provide support to the British heavies. Uxbridge later regretted leading the charge in person, saying &quot;I committed a great mistake&quot;, when he should have been organising an adequate reserve to move forward in support.{{sfn|Siborne&lt;!--HT--&gt;|1891|loc=''Letter 5'', pp. 7–10}}

The Household Brigade crossed the crest of the Allied position and charged downhill. The [[cuirassiers]] guarding d'Erlon's left flank were still dispersed, and so were swept over the deeply sunken main road and then routed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=426}}, note 18&lt;br /&gt;An episode famously used later by [[Victor Hugo]] in ''[[Les Misérables]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The sunken lane acted as a trap, funnelling the flight of the French cavalry to their own right and away from the British cavalry. Some of the cuirassiers then found themselves hemmed in by the steep sides of the sunken lane, with a confused mass of their own infantry in front of them, the 95th Rifles firing at them from the north side of the lane, and Somerset's heavy cavalry still pressing them from behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Siborne&lt;!--W--&gt;|1990|pp=410,411}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novelty of fighting armoured foes impressed the British cavalrymen, as was recorded by the commander of the Household Brigade.

{{quote|The blows of the sabres on the cuirasses sounded like braziers at work.|Lord Edward Somerset|&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Houssaye|1900|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Continuing their attack, the squadrons on the left of the Household Brigade then destroyed Aulard's brigade. Despite attempts to recall them, they continued past La Haye Sainte and found themselves at the bottom of the hill on blown horses facing Schmitz's brigade formed in [[infantry square|squares]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

To their left, the Union Brigade suddenly swept through the infantry lines (giving rise to the legend that some of the [[92nd (Gordon Highlanders) Regiment of Foot|92nd Gordon Highland Regiment]] clung onto their stirrups and accompanied them into the charge).&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The tale was related, in old age, by a Sgt-Major Dickinson of the Greys, reputedly the last survivor of the charge {{harv|Low|1911|p={{page needed|date=June 2013}} }}.&lt;/ref&gt; From the centre leftwards, the Royal Dragoons destroyed Bourgeois' brigade, capturing the eagle of the 105th ''Ligne''. The Inniskillings routed the other brigade of Quoit's division, and the Scots Greys came upon the lead French regiment, 45th ''Ligne'', as it was still reforming after having crossed the sunken road and broken through the hedge row in pursuit of the British infantry. The Greys captured the eagle of the 45th ''Ligne''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|pp=198–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; and overwhelmed Grenier's brigade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barbero 2006 155&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2006|p=155}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These would be the only two eagles captured from the French during the battle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barbero 2006 155&quot;/&gt; On Wellington's extreme left, [[Pierre François Joseph Durutte]]'s division had time to form squares and fend off groups of Greys.

As with the Household Cavalry, the officers of the Royals and Inniskillings found it very difficult to rein back their troops, who lost all cohesion. Having taken casualties, and still trying to reorder themselves, the Scots Greys and the rest of the Union Brigade found themselves before the main French lines.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1994|p=304}} Their horses were blown, and they were still in disorder without any idea of what their next collective objective was. Some attacked nearby gun batteries of the Grande Battery.
{{sfn|Wooten|1993|p=42}} Though the Greys had neither the time nor means to disable the cannon or carry them off, they put very many out of action as the gun crews were killed or fled the battlefield.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|p=211}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sergeant Major Dickinson of the Greys stated that his regiment was rallied before going on to attack the French artillery: Hamilton, the regimental commander, rather than holding them back cried out to his men &quot;Charge, charge the guns!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher (1999) p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon promptly responded by ordering a counter-attack by the cuirassier brigades of Farine and Travers and Jaquinot's two [[Chevau-léger]] (lancer) regiments in the I Corps [[light cavalry]] division. Disorganized and milling about the bottom of the valley between Hougoumont and [[La Belle Alliance]], the Scots Greys and the rest of the British heavy cavalry were taken by surprise by the counter-charge of [[Édouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud|Milhaud]]'s [[cuirassier]]s, joined by lancers from Baron Jaquinot's 1st Cavalry Division.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1994|pp=303–304}}

As Ponsonby tried to rally his men against the French cuirassers, he was attacked by Jaquinot's lancers and captured. A nearby party of Scots Greys saw the capture and attempted to rescue their brigade commander. However, the French lancer who had captured Ponsonby executed him and then used his lance to kill three of the Scots Greys who had attempted the rescue.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1994|p=304}} By the time Ponsonby died, the momentum had entirely returned in favour of the French. Milhaud's and Jaquinot's cavalrymen drove the Union Brigade from the valley. The result was very heavy losses for the British cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Siborne&lt;!--W--&gt;|1990|pp=425–426}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer |1999|p=86}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A counter-charge, by British light dragoons under Major-General Vandeleur and Dutch-Belgian light dragoons and [[hussar]]s under Major-General Ghigny on the left wing, and Dutch-Belgian ''[[carabinier]]s'' under Major-General Trip in the centre, repelled the French cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|pp=219–223}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

All figures quoted for the losses of the cavalry brigades as a result of this charge are estimates, as casualties were only noted down after the day of the battle and were for the battle as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adkin|2001|p=217}} (for initial strengths)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Losses are ultimately from the official returns taken the day after the battle: Household Brigade, initial strength 1,319, killed&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;95, wounded&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;248, missing&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;250, totals&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;593, horses lost&amp;nbsp;–&amp;nbsp;672.

T. Siborne]]'s book, he makes an estimate of around 900&amp;nbsp;men actually in line within the Union Brigade before its first charge {{harv|Siborne&lt;!--HT--&gt;|1891|loc=''Letter 35'', p. 69}}. Clark-Kennedy does not, however, explain how his estimate was arrived at. The shortfall of 432&amp;nbsp;men (the equivalent of a whole regiment) from the paper strength of the brigade is large. However, another officer of the brigade, John Mills of the 2nd Dragoons, says that the effective strength of the brigade did not &quot;exceed 1,200&quot; {{harv|Glover|2007|p=59}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Union Brigade lost heavily in both officers and men killed (including its commander, William Ponsonby, and Colonel Hamilton of the Scots Greys) and wounded. The 2nd Life Guards and the King's Dragoon Guards of the Household Brigade also lost heavily (with Colonel Fuller, commander of the King's DG, killed). However, the 1st Life Guards, on the extreme right of the charge, and the Blues, who formed a reserve, had kept their cohesion and consequently suffered significantly fewer casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Siborne&lt;!--W--&gt;|1990|pp=329,349}} (composition of brigades), pp. 422–424 (actions of brigades)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;[[William Siborne]] was in possession of a number of eyewitness accounts from generals, such as Uxbridge, down to cavalry cornets and infantry ensigns. This makes his history particularly useful (though only from the British and KGL perspective); some of these eyewitness letters were later published by his son, a British Major General ([[H. T. Siborne]]). Parts of William Siborne's account was, and is, highly controversial. The very negative light shed on the conduct of the Dutch-Belgian troops during the battle by Siborne, which it should be said was a reasonably accurate reflection the opinions of his British informants, prompted a semi-official rebuttal by Dutch historian captain [[Willem Jan Knoop]] in his ''&quot;Beschouwingen over Siborne's Geschiedenis van den oorlog van 1815 in Frankrijk en de Nederlanden&quot; en wederlegging van de in dat werk voorkomende beschuldigingen tegen het Nederlandsche leger''. Breda 1846; 2nd printing 1847. Knoop based his rebuttal on the official Dutch after-battle reports, drawn up within days of the battle, not on twenty-year-old recollections of veterans, like Siborne. Siborne rejected the rebuttal.&lt;/ref&gt; On the rolls the official, or paper strength, for both Brigades is given as 2,651 while Barbero and others estimate the actual strength at around 2,000&lt;ref name=&quot;Barbero 2006 142–143&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Barbero points out that in April the minister informed Wellington that cavalry regiments could allow themselves no more than 360 horses.

Some historians, such as Chandler and Weller, state that the British heavy cavalry were destroyed as a viable force following their first, epic charge. Barbero states that the Scots Grey were practically wiped out and that the other two regiments of the Union Brigade suffered comparable losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2006|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other historians, such as Clark-Kennedy and Wood, citing British eyewitness accounts state, however, that the heavy brigades, far from being ineffective, continued to provide valuable services. They counter-charged French cavalry numerous times (both brigades),{{sfn|Siborne&lt;!--HT--&gt;|1891|loc=Letters: 18, 26, 104}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark-Kennedy, p. 111&quot;&gt;Clark-Kennedy, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher (2001), pp. 142-143&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wood, pp. 164, 171&lt;/ref&gt; halted a combined cavalry and infantry attack (Household Brigade only),{{sfn|Siborne&lt;!--HT--&gt;|1891|p=38}}{{sfn|Siborne&lt;!--W--&gt;|1990|p=296}}&lt;ref&gt;Anglesey, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, pp. 90-91&lt;/ref&gt; were used to bolster the morale of those units in their vicinity at times of crisis, and filled gaps in the Anglo-Allied line caused by high casualties in infantry formations (both brigades).{{sfn|Siborne&lt;!--HT--&gt;|1891|loc=Letters 9, 18, 36}}&lt;ref&gt;Anglesey, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark-Kennedy, p. 110-111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood, p. 177&quot;&gt;Wood, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher (1999), p. 270-271&lt;/ref&gt; This service was rendered at a very high cost, as close combat with French cavalry, carbine fire, infantry musketry and—more deadly than all of these—artillery fire steadily eroded the number of effectives in the two brigades.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;In a cavalry unit an &quot;effective&quot; was an unwounded trooper mounted on a sound horse.

14,000 French troops of D'Erlon's I Corp had been committed to this attack. The I Corps had been driven in rout back across the valley costing Napoleon 3,000 casualties&lt;ref name=&quot;Esposito 1999, p.354&quot;&gt;Esposito &amp; Elting, ''A Military History and Atlas of the Napoleonic Wars'', Greenhill, 1999, p.354, Map 166.&lt;/ref&gt; including over 2,000&amp;nbsp;prisoners taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2006|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also some valuable time was lost, the charge had dispersed numerous units and it would take until 16:00 hours for D'Erlon's shaken corps to reform. And although elements of the Prussians now began to appear on the field to his right, Napoleon had already ordered Lobau's VI corps to move to the right flank to hold them back before D'Erlon's attack began.

===The French cavalry attack===
[[File:Marechal Ney à Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|[[Michel Ney|Marshal Ney]] leading the French cavalry charge]]
A little before 16:00, Ney noted an apparent exodus from Wellington's centre. He mistook the movement of casualties to the rear for the beginnings of a retreat, and sought to exploit it. Following the defeat of d'Erlon's Corps, Ney had few infantry reserves left, as most of the infantry been committed either to the futile Hougoumont attack or to the defence of the French right. Ney therefore tried to break Wellington's centre with cavalry alone.&lt;ref name=Siborne439&gt;{{Harvnb|Siborne&lt;!--W--&gt;|1990|p=439}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Initially [[Édouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud|Milhaud's]] reserve cavalry corps of cuirassiers and [[Charles, comte Lefebvre-Desnouettes|Lefebvre-Desnoëttes']] light cavalry division of the Imperial Guard, some 4,800&amp;nbsp;sabres, were committed. When these were repulsed, [[François Étienne de Kellermann|Kellermann's]] heavy cavalry corps and [[Claude-Étienne Guyot|Guyot's]] heavy cavalry of the Guard were added to the massed assault, a total of around 9,000&amp;nbsp;cavalry in 67&amp;nbsp;squadrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adkin|2001|p=356}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Napoleon saw the charge he said it was an hour too soon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Esposito 1999, p.354&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:French cuirassiers vs Nassauers.jpg|thumb|&quot;French [[Cuirassier]]s&quot;, by Louis Dumoulin.]]

Wellington's infantry responded by forming [[infantry square|squares]] (hollow box-formations four ranks deep). Squares were much smaller than usually depicted in paintings of the battle – a 500-man battalion square would have been no more than {{convert|60|ft|m}} in length on a side. Vulnerable to artillery or infantry, squares that stood their ground were deadly to cavalry, because they could not be outflanked and because horses would not charge into a hedge of bayonets. Wellington ordered his artillery crews to take shelter within the squares as the cavalry approached, and to return to their guns and resume fire as they retreated.&lt;ref&gt;Siborne (1990), p. 283&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adkin, pp. 273, 414&lt;/ref&gt;

Witnesses in the British infantry recorded as many as 12&amp;nbsp;assaults, though this probably includes successive waves of the same general attack; the number of general assaults was undoubtedly far fewer. Kellermann, recognising the futility of the attacks, tried to reserve the elite ''[[Carabiniers-à-Cheval|carabinier]]'' brigade from joining in, but eventually Ney spotted them and insisted on their involvement.&lt;ref name=Adkin359&gt;{{Harvnb|Adkin|2001|p=359}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A British eyewitness of the first French cavalry attack, an officer in the Foot Guards, recorded his impressions very lucidly and somewhat poetically:

{{quote|About four p.m., the enemy's artillery in front of us ceased firing all of a sudden, and we saw large masses of cavalry advance: not a man present who survived could have forgotten in after life the awful grandeur of that charge. You discovered at a distance what appeared to be an overwhelming, long moving line, which, ever advancing, glittered like a stormy wave of the sea when it catches the sunlight. On they came until they got near enough, whilst the very earth seemed to vibrate beneath the thundering tramp of the mounted host. One might suppose that nothing could have resisted the shock of this terrible moving mass. They were the famous cuirassiers, almost all old soldiers, who had distinguished themselves on most of the battlefields of Europe. In an almost incredibly short period they were within twenty yards of us, shouting ''&quot;Vive l'Empereur!&quot;'' The word of command, &quot;Prepare to receive cavalry&quot;, had been given, every man in the front ranks knelt, and a wall bristling with steel, held together by steady hands, presented itself to the infuriated cuirassiers.|Captain Rees Howell Gronow, Foot Guards|&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gronow|1862|loc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:Artillery in Battle of Waterloo by Jones.jpg|thumb|&quot;The artillery officers had the range so accurately, that every shot and shell fell into the very centre of their masses&quot; (Original inscription and drawing after [[George Jones (painter)|George Jones]]).]]

In essence this type of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on psychological shock for effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weller|1992|pp=211,212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not get close enough to the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adkin|2001|pp=252,361}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive counter-charges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. [[Cavalié Mercer|Captain Mercer]], who commanded 'G' Troop, [[Royal Horse Artillery]], thought the Brunswick troops on either side of him so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect:&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;This qualification may have been self-serving on Mercer's part. Wellington himself sought refuge in the &quot;shaky&quot; Brunswick squares at the time and observed what he interpreted as acts of cowardice by British artillerymen, who &quot;...&amp;nbsp;ran off the field entirely, taking with them limbers, ammunition, and everything&amp;nbsp;...&quot; as he wrote in a letter of 21 December 1815 to the Master-General of the Ordnance, Lord Mulgrave. The incident even justified the denial of pensions to members of the Artillery Corps in his view. So, where Mercer claimed heroism, Wellington saw the opposite. See for the full text of Wellington's letter, and an attempted rebuttal {{aut|Duncan, F.}} (1879) ''History of the Royal Regiment of Artillery'', Appendix A, pp. 444–464 [http://books.google.com/books?id=8qDrGClIogsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Wellington+captain+Sandham+Mulgrave&amp;lr=#PPA444,M1 Google Books.] The letter was originally published in ''WSD'', vol. XIV (1858 ed.), pp. 618–620&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I thus allowed them to advance unmolested until the head of the column might have been about fifty or sixty yards from us, and then gave the word, &quot;Fire!&quot; The effect was terrible. Nearly the whole leading rank fell at once; and the round shot, penetrating the column carried confusion throughout its extent&amp;nbsp;... the discharge of every gun was followed by a fall of men and horses like that of grass before the mower's scythe. |[[Cavalié Mercer|Captain Cavalié Mercer]], RHA|&lt;ref name=&quot;M70&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Mercer|1870|loc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Charge of the French Cuirassiers at Waterloo.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.2|A British square puts up dogged resistance against attacking French cavalry.]]

For reasons that remain unclear, no attempt was made to [[Touch hole|spike]] other allied guns while they were in French possession. In line with Wellington's orders, gunners were able to return to their pieces and fire into the French cavalry as they withdrew after each attack. After numerous costly but fruitless attacks on the Mont-Saint-Jean ridge, the French cavalry was spent.&lt;ref&gt;Cavalrymen were not allowed to dismount without orders, so individual initiative in spiking a cannon would have been impossible for any ranker. Each British cannon had a number of headless nails for spiking stored in a box on the gun carriage, so the French would have had the means to disable the guns readily available, had they known.{{Harvnb|Weller|1992|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their casualties cannot easily be estimated. Senior French cavalry officers, in particular the generals, experienced heavy losses. Four divisional commanders were wounded, nine brigadiers wounded, and one killed – testament to their courage and their habit of leading from the front.&lt;ref name=Adkin359/&gt; Illustratively, Houssaye reports that the ''Grenadiers à Cheval'' numbered 796 of all ranks on 15 June, but just 462 on 19 June, while the Empress Dragoons lost 416 of 816 over the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Houssaye|1900|p=522}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall Guyot's Guard heavy cavalry division lost 47&amp;nbsp;per cent of its strength.

Eventually it became obvious, even to Ney, that cavalry alone were achieving little. Belatedly, he organised a combined-arms attack, using Bachelu's division and Tissot's regiment of Foy's division from Reille's II Corps (about 6,500&amp;nbsp;infantrymen) plus those French cavalry that remained in a fit state to fight. This assault was directed along much the same route as the previous heavy cavalry attacks.{{sfn|Adkin|2001|p=361}} It was halted by a charge of the Household Brigade cavalry led by Uxbridge. The British cavalry were unable, however, to break the French infantry, and fell back with losses from musketry fire.{{sfn||Siborne&lt;!--HT--&gt;|1891|pp=14, 38–39}}

Uxbridge recorded that he tried to lead the Dutch Carabiniers, under Major-General [[Albert Dominicus Trip van Zoudtlandt|Trip]], to renew the attack and that they refused to follow him. Other members of the British cavalry staff also commented on this occurrence.{{sfn|Siborne&lt;!--HT--&gt;|1891|loc=pp. 14–15 and letters 6,7 and 9}} However, there is no support for this incident in Dutch or Belgian sources.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;On the contrary, many contradicted this British account vehemently.

Four were posted to Captain Mercer's horse artillery troop, where he found them &quot;amazingly snappish and sulky with everyone.&quot;{{Harv|Mercer|1870|loc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Knotel - The storming of La Haye Sainte.jpg|right|thumb|alt=The storming of La Haye Sainte by Knötel|The storming of La Haye Sainte by Knötel]]

===The capture of La Haye Sainte===

At approximately the same time as Ney's combined-arms assault on the centre-right of Wellington's line, rallied elements of D'Erlon's I Corps, spearheaded by the 13th ''Légère,'' renewed the attack on La Haye Sainte and this time were successful, partly because the King's German Legion's ammunition ran out. But these brave Germans had held the center of the battlefield for almost the entire day. This had stalled the French advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Simms|first1= Brendan|date= 2014|title= The Longest Afternoon: The 400 Men Who Decided the Battle of Waterloo|publisher= Allen Lane|isbn= 978-0241004609}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beamish|1995|p=367}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ney then moved [[horse artillery]] up towards Wellington's centre and began to pulverise the infantry squares at short-range with [[canister shot|canister]].&lt;ref name=Siborne439/&gt; The 30th and 73rd Regiments suffered such heavy losses that they had to combine to form a viable square.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2006|p=236}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The possession of La Haye Sainte by the French was a very dangerous incident. It uncovered the very centre of the Anglo-Allied army, and established the enemy within 60 yards of that centre.

Along with this artillery fire a multitude of French ''tirailleurs'' occupied the dominant positions behind La Haye Sainte and poured an effective fire into the squares. The situation was now so dire that the 33rd Regiment's colours and all of Halkett's brigade's colours were sent to the rear for safety, described by historian Alessandro Barbero as, &quot;...&amp;nbsp;a measure that was without precedent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2006|p=241}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Wellington, noticing the slackening of fire from La Haye Sainte, with his staff rode closer to it. French skirmishers appeared around the building and fired on the British command as it struggled to get away through the hedgerow along the road. Alten ordered a single battalion, the Fifth KGL to recapture the farm. Their Colonel Ompteda obeyed and chased off some French skirmishers until French cuirassiers fell on his open flank, killed him, destroyed his battalion and took its colour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barbero 2006 234&quot;/&gt; A Dutch-Belgian cavalry regiment ordered to charge, retreated from the field instead, fired on by their own infantry. Merlen's Light Cavalry Brigade charged the French artillery taking position near La Haye Sainte but were shot to pieces and the brigade fell apart. The Netherlands Cavalry Division, Wellington's last cavalry reserve behind the center having lost half their strength was now useless and the French cavalry, despite its losses, were masters of the field compelling the allied infantry to remain in square. More and more French artillery was brought forward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barbero 2006 235–236&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2006|pp=235–236}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A French battery advanced to within 300 yards of the 1/1st Nassau square causing heavy casualties. When the Nassauers attempted to attack the battery they were ridden down by a squadron of cuirassiers . Yet another battery deployed on the flank of Mercer's battery and shot up its horses and limbers and pushed Mercer back. Mercer later recalled, ''&quot;The rapidity and precision of this fire was quite appaling. Every shot almost took effect, and I certainly expected we should all be annihilated. ... The saddle-bags, in many instances were torn from horses' backs ... One shell I saw explode under the two finest wheel-horses in the troop down they dropped.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;Barbero 2006 235–236&quot;/&gt;

French ''tirailleurs'' occupied the dominant positions, especially one on a knoll overlooking the square of the 27th. Unable to break square to drive off the French infantry because of the presence of French cavalry and artillery, they had to remain in that formation and endure the fire of the ''tirailleurs''. That fire nearly annihilated the 27th Foot, the Inniskillings would lose lost two-thirds of their strength within that 3 or 4 hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barbero 2006 239&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Barbero|2006|pp=239}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The banks on the road side, the garden wall, the knoll and sandpit swarmed with skirmishers, who seemed determined to keep down our fire in front; those behind the artificial bank seemed more intent upon destroying the 27th, who at this time, it may literally be said, were lying dead in square; their loss after La Haye Sainte had fallen was awful, without the satisfaction of having scarcely fired a shot, and many of our troops in rear of the ridge were similarly situated.|Edward Cotton, 7th Hussars|&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cotton|1849|pp=106,107}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Arrival of the Prussian IV Corps: Plancenoit===

{{quote|Night or the Prussians must come.|Wellington&lt;ref name=&quot;Barbero 2006 242&quot;/&gt;}}

[[Image:Prussian Attack Plancenoit by Adolf Northern.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The Prussian attack on [[Plancenoit]] painted by [[Adolph Northern]]]]

The first Prussian corps to arrive was Bülow's IV Corps. His objective was Plancenoit, which the Prussians intended to use as a springboard into the rear of the French positions. Blücher intended to secure his right upon Frichermont using the Bois de Paris road.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofschroer-116&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blücher and Wellington had been exchanging communications since 10:00 and had agreed to this advance on Frichermont if Wellington's centre was under attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofschroer-95&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chesney|1907|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Bülow noted that the way to Plancenoit lay open and that the time was 16:30.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofschroer-116&quot;/&gt;

At about this time, as the French cavalry attack was in full spate, the 15th Brigade IV Corps was sent to link up with the Nassauers of Wellington's left flank in the Frichermont-La Haie area with the brigade's horse artillery battery and additional brigade artillery deployed to its left in support.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofschroer-117&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon sent Lobau's corps to intercept the rest of Bülow's IV Corps proceeding to Plancenoit. The 15th Brigade threw Lobau's troops out of Frichermont with a determined bayonet charge, then proceeded up the Frichermont heights, battering French Chasseurs with 12-pounder artillery fire, and pushed on to Plancenoit. This sent Lobau's corps into retreat to the Plancenoit area, driving Lobau past the rear of the ''Armee Du Nord's'' right flank and directly threatening its only line of retreat. Hiller's 16th Brigade also pushed forward with six battalions against Plancenoit.

Napoleon had dispatched all eight battalions of the Young Guard to reinforce Lobau, who was now seriously pressed. The Young Guard counter-attacked and, after very hard fighting, secured Plancenoit, but were themselves counter-attacked and driven out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofschroer-122&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon sent two battalions of the Middle/Old Guard into Plancenoit and after ferocious bayonet fighting—they did not deign to fire their muskets—this force recaptured the village.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofschroer-122&quot;/&gt;

===Zieten's flank march===

[[Image:Battle of Waterloo map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Situation from 17:30 to 20:00]]

Throughout the late afternoon, Zieten's I Corps had been arriving in greater strength in the area just north of La Haie. General Müffling, Prussian liaison to Wellington, rode to meet I Corps. Zieten had by this time brought up his 1st Brigade, but had become concerned at the sight of stragglers and casualties from the Nassau units on Wellington's left and from the Prussian 15th Brigade. These troops appeared to be withdrawing and Zieten, fearing that his own troops would be caught up in a general retreat, was starting to move away from Wellington's flank and towards the Prussian main body near Plancenoit. Zeiten had also received a direct order from Blücher to support Bülow, Zeiten obeyed and marched to Bülow's aid. Müffling saw this movement away and persuaded Zieten to support Wellington's left flank. Zieten resumed his march to support Wellington directly, and the arrival of his troops allowed Wellington to reinforce his crumbling centre by moving cavalry from his left.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=125}} This citation is paragraph inclusive.&lt;/ref&gt;

I Corps proceeded to attack the French troops before Papelotte and by 19:30 the French position was bent into a rough horseshoe shape. The ends of the line were now based on Hougoumont on the left, Plancenoit on the right, and the centre on La Haie.&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-139&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Durutte had taken the positions of La Haie and Papelotte in a series of attacks,&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-139/&gt; but now retreated behind Smohain without opposing the Prussian 24th Regiment as it retook both. The 24th advanced against the new French position, was repulsed, and returned to the attack supported by Silesian ''Schützen'' (riflemen) and the F/1st ''Landwehr''.&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-140&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French initially fell back before the renewed assault, but now began seriously to contest ground, attempting to regain Smohain and hold on to the ridgeline and the last few houses of Papelotte.&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-140/&gt;

The 24th Regiment linked up with a Highlander battalion on its far right and along with the 13th ''Landwehr'' regiment and cavalry support threw the French out of these positions. Further attacks by the 13th ''Landwehr'' and the 15th Brigade drove the French from Frichermont.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=141}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Durutte's division, finding itself about to be charged by massed squadrons of Zieten's I Corps cavalry reserve, retreated from the battlefield. I Corps then advanced to the Brussels road and the only line of retreat available to the French.

===Attack of the Imperial Guard===

Meanwhile, with Wellington's centre exposed by the fall of La Haye Sainte and the Plancenoit front temporarily stabilised, Napoleon committed his last reserve, the hitherto-undefeated Imperial Guard. This attack, mounted at around 19:30, was intended to break through Wellington's centre and roll up his line away from the Prussians. Although it is one of the most celebrated passages of arms in military history, it is unclear which units actually participated. It appears that it was mounted by five battalions of the Middle Guard,&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Two Chasseur battalions were merged into one on the day of the battle, so while five Guard formations went forward, they may have comprised six battalions {{Harvnb|Barbero|2005|loc={{Page needed|date=May 2010}}}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and not by the Grenadiers or Chasseurs of the Old Guard.

[[File:Crofts-Napoleon's last grand attack at Waterloo.jpg|thumb|Napoleon addresses the [[Old Guard]] as it prepares to attack the Anglo-allied centre at Waterloo.]]

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;I saw four regiments of the middle guard, conducted by the Emperor, arriving. With these troops, he wished to renew the attack, and penetrate the centre of the enemy. He ordered me to lead them on; generals, officers and soldiers all displayed the greatest intrepidity; but this body of troops was too weak to resist, for a long time, the forces opposed to it by the enemy, and it was soon necessary to renounce the hope which this attack had, for a few moments, inspired. |Marshal M. Ney|&lt;ref name=Booth-73-74&gt;{{Harvnb|Booth|1815|pp=73,74}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:Soldat-der-Alten-Garde.png|thumb|upright|left|[[Grenadier]] of the [[Old Guard]], by [[Édouard Detaille]]]]

Three Old Guard battalions did move forward and formed the attack's second line, though they remained in reserve and did not directly assault the allied line.{{sfn|Adkin|2001|p=391}}&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The attacking battalions were 1st/3rd and 4th Grenadiers and 1st/3rd, 2nd/3rd and 4th Chasseurs of the Middle Guard; those remaining in reserve were the 2nd/2nd Grenadiers, 2nd/1st and 2nd/2nd Chasseurs of the Old Guard {{harv|Adkin|2001|p=392}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Marching through a hail of canister and skirmisher fire, the 3,000 or so Middle Guardsmen advanced to the west of La Haye Sainte and, in so doing, separated into three distinct attack forces. One, consisting of two battalions of Grenadiers, defeated Wellington's first line of British, Brunswick and Nassau troops and marched on. [[David Hendrik Chassé|Chassé]]'s relatively fresh Dutch division was sent against them and a battery of Dutch horse-artillery, commanded by captain [[Carel Frederik Krahmer de Bichin|Krahmer de Bichin]], fired into the victorious Grenadiers' flank.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bas|1909|pp=249–251, 258–259}} (vol.2)&lt;/ref&gt; This still could not stop the Guard's advance, so Chassé ordered his first brigade (colonel [[Hendrik Detmers|Detmers]]) to charge the outnumbered French with the bayonet, who faltered and broke.&lt;ref name=Chesney-178&gt;{{Harvnb|Chesney|1907|pp=178,179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bas|1909|pp=252–253,419–424}} (vol.2)&lt;/ref&gt;

Further to the west, 1,500 British Foot Guards under [[Peregrine Maitland|Maitland]] were lying down to protect themselves from the French artillery. As two battalions of Chasseurs approached—the second prong of the Imperial Guard's attack—Maitland's guardsmen rose and devastated them with point-blank volleys. The Chasseurs deployed to answer the fire, but began to waver. A bayonet charge by the Foot Guards then broke them. The third prong, a fresh Chasseur battalion, now came up in support. The British guardsmen retired with these Chasseurs in pursuit, but the latter were halted as the [[52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot|52nd Light Infantry]], led by [[John Colborne]], wheeled in line onto their flank and poured a devastating fire into them and then charged.&lt;ref name=Chesney-178/&gt;&lt;ref name=Parry-70&gt;{{Harvnb|Parry|1900|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under this onslaught, they too broke.&lt;ref name=Parry-70/&gt;

The last of the Guard retreated headlong. A ripple of panic passed through the French lines as the astounding news spread: &quot;''La Garde recule. Sauve qui peut''!&quot; (&quot;The Guard is retreating. Every man for himself!&quot;) Wellington now stood up in [[Copenhagen (horse)|Copenhagen]]'s stirrups and waved his hat in the air to signal a general advance. His army rushed forward from the lines and threw themselves upon the retreating French.&lt;ref name=Chesney-178/&gt;

The surviving Imperial Guard rallied on their three reserve battalions (some sources say four) just south of La Haye Sainte for a [[last stand]]. A charge from [[Frederick Adam|Adam's]] Brigade and the Hanoverian ''Landwehr'' Osnabrück Battalion, plus Vivian's and Vandeleur's relatively fresh cavalry brigades to their right, threw them into confusion. Those left in semi-cohesive units retreated towards ''La Belle Alliance''.

===Capture of Plancenoit===

[[File:Ludwig Elsholtz Erstürmung von Planchenois.jpg|thumb|right|The storming of Plancenoit by [[Ludwig Elsholtz]]]]
At about the same time, the Prussian 5th, 14th, and 16th Brigades were starting to push through Plancenoit, in the third assault of the day. The church was by now on fire, while its graveyard—the French centre of resistance—had corpses strewn about &quot;as if by a whirlwind&quot;. Five Guard battalions were deployed in support of the Young Guard, virtually all of which was now committed to the defence, along with remnants of Lobau's corps. The key to the Plancenoit position proved to be the Chantelet woods to the south. Pirch's II Corps had arrived with two brigades and reinforced the attack of IV Corps, advancing through the woods. The 25th Regiment's musketeer battalions threw the 1/2e Grenadiers (Old Guard) out of the Chantelet woods, outflanking Plancenoit and forcing a retreat. The Old Guard retreated in good order until they met the mass of troops retreating in panic, and became part of that rout. The Prussian IV Corps advanced beyond Plancenoit to find masses of French retreating in disorder from British pursuit. The Prussians were unable to fire for fear of hitting Wellington's units. This was the fifth and final time that Plancenoit changed hands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofschröer 1999 p=144 to 145&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|pp=144–145}}This citation is paragraph inclusive.&lt;/ref&gt;

French forces not retreating with the Guard were surrounded in their positions and eliminated, neither side asking for nor offering quarter. The French Young Guard Division reported 96&amp;nbsp;per cent casualties, and two-thirds of Lobau's Corps ceased to exist.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

{{quote|Despite their great courage and stamina, the French Guards fighting in the village began to show signs of wavering. The church was already on fire with columns of red flame coming out of the windows, aisles and doors. In the village itself—still the scene of bitter house-to-house fighting—everything was burning, adding to the confusion. However, once Major von Witzleben's manoeuvre was accomplished and the French Guards saw their flank and rear threatened, they began to withdraw. The Guard Chasseurs under General [[Jean-Jacques Germain Pelet-Clozeau|Pelet]] formed the rearguard. The remnants of the Guard left in a great rush, leaving large masses of artillery, equipment and ammunition wagons in the wake of their retreat. The evacuation of Plancenoit led to the loss of the position that was to be used to cover the withdrawal of the French Army to Charleroi. The Guard fell back from Plancenoit in the direction of Maison du Roi and Caillou. Unlike other parts of the battlefield, there were no cries of &quot;Sauve qui peut!&quot; here. Instead, the cry &quot;Sauvons nos aigles!&quot; (&quot;Let's save our eagles!&quot;) could be heard.|Official History of the 25th Regiment, 4 Corps|&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofschröer 1999 p=144 to 145&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|pp=144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He hoped to rally the French army behind them,{{sfn|Kincaid|2006|p=435}} but as retreat turned into rout, they too were forced to withdraw, one on either side of ''La Belle Alliance'', in square as protection against Coalition cavalry. Until persuaded that the battle was lost and he should leave, Napoleon commanded the square to the left of the inn.&lt;ref name=Creasy-XV/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Comte d'Erlon|1815|loc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam's Brigade charged and forced back this square,&lt;ref name=Parry-70/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-149&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Prussians engaged the other.

As dusk fell, both squares withdrew in relatively good order, but the French artillery and everything else fell into the hands of the allies. The retreating Guards were surrounded by thousands of fleeing, broken French troops. Coalition cavalry harried the fugitives until about 23:00, with Gneisenau pursuing them as far as Genappe before ordering a halt. There, Napoleon's abandoned carriage was captured, still containing diamonds left in the rush. These became part of King Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia's crown jewels; one Major Keller of the F/15th received the [[Pour le Mérite]] with oak leaves for the feat.&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-151&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this time 78&amp;nbsp;guns and 2,000&amp;nbsp;prisoners had also been taken, including more generals.&lt;ref name=Hofschroer-150&gt;{{Harvnb|Hofschröer|1999|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waterloo cost Wellington around 15,000 dead or wounded and Blücher some 7,000 (810 of which were suffered by just one unit: the 18th Regiment, which served in Bülow's 15th Brigade, had fought at both Frichermont and Plancenoit, and won 33 [[Iron Cross]]es).{{sfn|Mantle|2000}} Napoleon's losses were 24,000 to 26,000 killed or wounded and including 6,000 to 7,000 captured with an additional 15,000 deserting subsequent to the battle and over the following days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barbero 2006 312&quot;/&gt;

The effectiveness of the lance was noted by all participants and this weapon subsequently became more widespread throughout Europe; the British converted their first light cavalry regiment to lancers in 1816, their uniforms, of Polish origin, were based on those of the [[Polish 1st Light Cavalry Regiment of the Imperial Guard|Imperial Guard lancers]].

==Analysis==

===Historical importance===

Waterloo was a decisive battle in more than one sense. It definitively ended the series of wars that had convulsed Europe—and involved many other regions of the world—since the [[French Revolution]] of the early 1790s. It also ended the [[First French Empire]] and the political and military career of [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]], one of the greatest commanders and statesmen in history.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Through the finality of Napoleon's defeat, &quot;met his/her Waterloo&quot; has entered the English lexicon as a phrase to describe someone's circumstances when they have met with absolute and final defeat.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, it ushered in almost half a century of international peace in Europe; no further major conflict occurred until the [[Crimean War]].

===Baron Jomini's view of the reasons for Napoleon's defeat===

General [[Antoine-Henri Jomini|Antoine-Henri]], Baron Jomini, one of the leading military writers on the Napoleonic art of war, had a number of very cogent explanations of the reasons behind Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;Jomini was Swiss, but was an officer, eventually a general, in the French army and had served on the staff of Marshal Ney. He later served in the Russian Army.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In my opinion, four principal causes led to this disaster:

The first, and most influential, was the arrival, skilfully combined, of Blücher, and the false movement that favoured this arrival;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;This &quot;false movement&quot; was the detachment of Grouchy's force in pursuit of the Prussians: Napoleon had overestimated the extent of his victory at Ligny and underestimated the resilience of the Prussians. He also seems to have discounted the presence of Bülow's substantial corps, which had not been in action at Ligny. Had Napoleon retained Grouchy's 30,000 men as a guard for his right flank, it is likely that these troops could have held off the Prussians and allowed the rest of Napoleon's army to attack Wellington's army unmolested.&lt;/ref&gt; the second, was the admirable firmness of the British infantry, joined to the sang-froid and aplomb of its chiefs; the third, was the horrible weather, that had softened the ground, and rendered the offensive movements so toilsome, and retarded till one o'clock the attack that should have been made in the morning; the fourth, was the inconceivable formation of the first corps, in masses very much too deep for the first grand attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jomini|1864|pp=223,224}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The battlefield today==

[[Image:Waterloo Lion.jpg|thumb|[[Lion's Mound]] at Waterloo, erected on the spot where it is believed the Prince of Orange was wounded.]]

[[File:French 6 pounder field gun cast 1813 in Metz captured at Waterloo by the Duke of Wellington.jpg|thumb|French [[Canon de 6 système An XI|6-pounder field gun]], cast in 1813 in [[Metz]], captured at the Battle of Waterloo by the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], now at the [[Tower of London]].]]

Some portions of the terrain on the battlefield have been altered from their 1815 appearance. Tourism began the day after the battle, with Captain Mercer noting that on 19 June &quot;a carriage drove on the ground from Brussels, the inmates of which, alighting, proceeded to examine the field.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;M70&quot;/&gt; In 1820, the Netherlands' King [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]] ordered the construction of a monument on the spot where it was believed his son, the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]], had been wounded. The [[Lion's Hillock]], a giant mound, was constructed here using {{convert|300000|m3|cuyd}} of earth taken from the ridge at the centre of the British line, effectively removing the southern bank of Wellington's sunken road.

{{quote|Every one is aware that the variously inclined undulations of the plains, where the engagement between Napoleon and Wellington took place, are no longer what they were on 18&amp;nbsp;June 1815. By taking from this mournful field the wherewithal to make a monument to it, its real relief has been taken away, and history, disconcerted, no longer finds her bearings there. It has been disfigured for the sake of glorifying it. Wellington, when he beheld Waterloo once more, two years later, exclaimed, &quot;They have altered my field of battle!&quot; Where the great pyramid of earth, surmounted by the lion, rises to-day, there was a hillock which descended in an easy slope towards the Nivelles road, but which was almost an escarpment on the side of the highway to Genappe. The elevation of this escarpment can still be measured by the height of the two knolls of the two great sepulchres which enclose the road from Genappe to Brussels: one, the English tomb, is on the left; the other, the German tomb, is on the right. There is no French tomb. The whole of that plain is a sepulchre for France.|[[Victor Hugo]], ''[[Les Misérables]]''|&lt;ref name=&quot;Hugo&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hugo|1862|loc=Chapter VII: Napoleon in a Good Humor}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other terrain features and notable landmarks on the field have remained virtually unchanged since the battle. These include the rolling farmland to the east of the Brussels-Charleroi Road as well as the buildings at Hougoumont, La Haye Sainte, and La Belle Alliance.

Apart from the Lion Mound, there are several more conventional but noteworthy monuments throughout the battlefield. A cluster of monuments at the Brussels-Charleroi and Braine L'Alleud-Ohain crossroads marks the mass graves of British, Dutch, Hanoverian and [[King's German Legion]] troops. A monument to the French dead, entitled ''L'aigle Blessé'' (&quot;The Wounded Eagle&quot;), marks the location where it is believed one of the Imperial Guard units formed a square during the closing moments of the battle. A monument to the Prussian dead is located in the village of [[Plancenoit]] on the site where one of their artillery batteries took position. The [[Guillaume Philibert Duhesme|Duhesme]] mausoleum is one among the few graves of the fallen. It is located at the side of Saint Martin's Church in [[Ways, Belgium|Ways]], a hamlet in the municipality of [[Genappe]]. Seventeen fallen officers are buried in the crypt of the [[Brussels Cemetery#The British Waterloo Campaign Monument|British Monument]] in the [[Brussels Cemetery]] in [[Evere]].{{sfn|Hoorebeeke|2007|pp=6–21}} The remains of an unknown soldier were discovered in 2012. He was a slightly hunchbacked infantryman, {{convert|1.60|m|ft}} tall, and was hit in the chest by a French bullet. His rifle, coins, and position on the battlefield led experts to believe he was Hanoverian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Peel|first=Hugues Van  |date=11 December 2012 |title=Le soldat retrouvé sur le site de Waterloo serait Hanovrien |publisher=[[RTBF]] |url=http://www.rtbf.be/info/regions/detail_le-soldat-retrouve-sur-le-site-de-waterloo-etait-prussien?id=7890492|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;
