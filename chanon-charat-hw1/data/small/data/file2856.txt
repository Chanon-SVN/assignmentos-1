== Name ==

=== Etymology ===
[[File:Balkangebirge Balkan topo de.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Balkan Mountains]]]] The region takes its name from the [[Balkan Mountains]] in [[Bulgaria]] and [[Serbia]]. It is believed the name was brought to the region in the 7th century by the [[Bulgars]] who applied it to the area, as a part of the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. In [[Bulgarian language]] the word ''balkan'' (балкан) means &quot;mountain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Андрейчин Л. и др., Български тълковен речник (допълнен и преработен от Д. Попов). Четвърто преработено и допълнено издание.: Издателство “Наука и изкуство”. С., 1994&lt;/ref&gt; It may have derived from the [[Persian language|Persian]] ''bālkāneh'' or ''bālākhāna'', meaning &quot;high, above, or proud house.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Imagining the Balkans | first=Maria N. | last =Todorova | publisher = Oxford University Press, Inc. | year = 1997 | location = New York | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=-EuFwLQhvYMC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=balkans+etymology+persian&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Xgm4TqebCpSy8QORstjoBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=balkans%20etymology%20persian&amp;f=false | page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name is still preserved in Central Asia with the [[Balkan Daglary]] (Balkan Mountains)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://land.worldcitydb.com/balkhan_mountains_3522246.html | title = Balkhan Mountains | work = World Land Features Database | publisher=Land.WorldCityDB.com |accessdate=31 March 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080228223148/http://land.worldcitydb.com/balkhan_mountains_3522246.html| archivedate= 28 February 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Balkan Province]] of [[Turkmenistan]]. In [[Ottoman Turkish language|Turkish]] ''{{lang|tr|balkan}}''   means &quot;a chain of wooded [[mountains]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Balkan.&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/balkan.html|title=Balkan|work=Encarta World English Dictionary|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=31 March 2008 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwPqi7mD|archivedate=31 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = Büyük Türkçe Sözlük | title = balkan | publisher = Türk Dil Kurumu | url = http://www.tdkterim.gov.tr/bts/ | quote = Sarp ve ormanlık sıradağ | language = Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[classical antiquity]] (and until the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest), the region was referred to in [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] sources as the &quot;Peninsula of [[Haemus]]&quot;. The mountain range itself was known as the &quot;[[Haemus Mons|Haemus Mountains]]&quot;, the name being of possibly [[Thracians|Thracian]] etymology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=VDoQAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=hemus+thracian+name&amp;dq=hemus+thracian+name&amp;output=html_text&amp;cd=6 |title= Bulgaria |page= 54 |work= Hemus – a Thracian name |publisher= Indiana University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other possible etymology for &quot;Haemus&quot; ({{lang|grc|Αἵμος}}) comes from the Greek mythology. 'Haemus', still being used in [[Modern Greek]], derives from the Greek word &quot;haema&quot; ({{lang|grc|αἵμα}}) meaning 'blood'. The myth goes about the fight of [[Zeus]] and the monster/titan [[Typhon]]. Zeus injured Typhon with a thunder bolt and Typhon's blood fell on the mountains from which they got their name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.bg/books?id=3cmSa4H_C0oC&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;ots=SBNq-jEdSY&amp;dq=Haemus%20bloody%20zeus%20typhon&amp;hl=bg&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q=Haemus%20bloody%20zeus%20typhon&amp;f=false|title=Gods and Heroes of the Greeks: The Library of Apollodorus|work=Google Books|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a larger scale, the mountains are only one part of a long continuous chain crossing the region in the form of a reversed letter S, from the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] south to the Balkan range proper, before marching away east into [[Turkey]]. The [[Balkan Mountains]] include the [[Stara Planina]] (Old Mountain) mountain range in [[Bulgaria]] and part of [[Serbia]]. On the west coast, an offshoot of the [[Dinaric Alps]] follows the coast south through [[Dalmatia]] and [[Albania]], crosses Greece, and continues into the sea in the form of [[islands]].

In the languages of the region, the peninsula is known as:
* Slavic languages:
** {{lang-bg|Балкански полуостров}}, transliterated: ''{{lang|bg|Balkanski poluostrov}}''
** {{lang-bs|Balkansko poluostrvo}}
** {{lang-hr|Balkanski poluotok}}

* Latin languages:

** {{lang-vec|Penìxoła balcànega}}
* {{lang-sq|Gadishulli Ballkanik}} and ''{{lang|sq|Siujdhesa e Ballkanit}}''
* {{lang-el|Βαλκανική χερσόνησος}}, transliterated: ''{{lang|el|Valkaniki hersonisos}}''
* {{lang-tr|Balkan Yarımadası}} (or alternatively: Balkanlar)

=== Evolution of meaning ===
The first attested time the name &quot;Balkan&quot; was used in the West for the mountain range in [[Bulgaria]] was in a letter sent in 1490 to Pope [[Innocent VIII]] by Buonaccorsi Callimaco, an Italian humanist, writer and diplomat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Todorova|first=Maria|title=Imagining the Balkans|page=22|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=2009|isbn=0-19-538786-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; English traveler [[John Morritt]] introduced this term into the English literature at the end of the 18th century, and other authors started applying the name to the wider area between the Adriatic and the Black Sea. The concept of the &quot;Balkans&quot; was created by the German geographer August Zeune in 1808.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pavic|first=Silvia|url=http://geography.about.com/library/misc/ucbalkans.htm|title=Some Thoughts About The Balkans.|publisher=About, Inc.|date=22 November 2000|accessdate=31 March 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080228230925/http://geography.about.com/library/misc/ucbalkans.htm| archivedate= 28 February 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1820s, &quot;Balkan became the preferred although not yet exclusive term alongside Haemus among British travelers... Among Russian travelers not so burdened by classical toponymy, Balkan was the preferred term.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Maria Todorova Gutgsell, ''Imagining the Balkans'' (Oxford University Press, 2009; ISBN 0199728380), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

As time passed, the term gradually acquired political connotations far from its initial geographic meaning, arising from political changes from the late 19th century to the creation of post–[[World War I]] [[Yugoslavia]] (initially the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]). Zeune's goal was to have a geographical parallel term to the [[Italian peninsula|Italic]] and [[Iberian Peninsula]], and seemingly nothing more. The gradually acquired political connotations are newer and, to a large extent, due to oscillating political circumstances.

After the [[dissolution of Yugoslavia]] beginning in June 1991, the term &quot;Balkans&quot; again received a negative meaning, even in casual usage (see [[Balkanization]]).

=== Southeast Europe ===
{{main|Southeast Europe}}
In part due to the historical and political connotations of the term &quot;Balkans&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/balkanize|title=Balkanize|publisher=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially since the military conflicts of the 1990s, the term &quot;'''[[Southeast Europe]]'''&quot; is becoming increasingly popular even though it literally refers to a much larger area and thus isn't as precise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A history of Eastern Europe |last=Bideleux |first=Robert |authorlink= |author2=Ian Jeffries |year=2007 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |location= |isbn=978-0-415-36627-4 |page=37 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=PTB0gn_qwTcC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[European Union]] initiative of 1999 is called the ''[[Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe]]'', and the online newspaper ''Balkan Times'' renamed itself ''[[Southeast European Times]]'' in 2003.

Countries whose territories lie completely within the Balkan peninsula:
* {{ALB}}
* {{BIH}}
* {{BUL}}
* {{GRE}}
* {{flagicon|Kosovo}} [[Kosovo]]
* {{MKD}}
* {{MNE}}

Countries that lie partially within the Balkan peninsula:

* {{SRB}} (larger part in the Balkans, smaller in [[Central Europe]])
* {{ROU}} (Smaller part, commonly placed in [[Eastern Europe]] or [[Southeast Europe]])
* {{TUR}} (Smaller part, commonly placed in [[Western Asia]] or [[Southeast Europe]])
* {{CRO}} (Minor part, placed in [[Southeast Europe]] or [[Central Europe]])
* {{SLO}} (Minor part, placed in [[Central Europe]])

As of 1920 until [[World War II]] Italy included [[Istria]] and some [[Dalmatia|Dalmatian areas]] (like ''Zara'', known as [[Zadar]]) that are within the general definition of the Balkan peninsula. The current territory of Italy includes only the small area around [[Trieste]] and [[Gorizia]] inside the Balkan Peninsula. However, the regions of Trieste and Istria are not usually considered part of the Balkans by Italian geographers, due to a definition of the Balkans that limits its western border to the Kupa River.&lt;ref&gt;Istituto Geografico De Agostini, ''L'Enciclopedia Geografica – Vol.I – Italia'', 2004, Ed. De Agostini p.78&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Balkans ===

The abstracted term &quot;The Balkans&quot; covers those countries which lie within the boundaries of the Balkan Peninsula.&lt;ref name=jel01/&gt; Before 1991, the whole of [[Yugoslavia]] was considered to be part of the Balkans.&lt;ref name=&quot;tin51&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=World Geography Affected by World Upheavals |last=Tintero |first=Felipa L. |authorlink= |author2=Felicitas R.

=== Western Balkans ===
Some institutions{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} and member states of the [[European Union]] have defined the &quot;Western Balkans&quot; as the south-east European area that includes countries that are not members of the European Union, while others refer to the geographical aspects.

[[File:Голубачка тврђава.jpg|thumb|[[Golubac Fortress]] in Serbia, guarding the [[Danube|Danubian frontier]] of the Balkans]]
Most of the area is covered by mountain ranges running from north-west to south-east. The main ranges are the [[Balkan mountains]], running from the Black Sea Coast in Bulgaria to its border with Serbia, the [[Rhodope mountains]] in southern Bulgaria and northern Greece, the [[Dinaric Alps]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Montenegro, the [[Šar Mountains|Šar]] massif which spreads from Albania to Macedonia, and the [[Pindus]] range, spanning from southern Albania into central Greece and the [[Albanian Alps]]. The highest mountain of the region is [[Rila]] in Bulgaria, with [[Musala]] at 2925 m, [[Mount Olympus (Mountain)|Mount Olympus]] in Greece, the throne of Zeus, being second at 2917 m and [[Vihren]] in Bulgaria being the third at 2914 m. The karst field or [[polje]] is a common feature of the landscape.

On the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] coasts the climate is [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]], on the [[Black Sea]] coast the climate is [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] and [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]], and inland it is [[humid continental climate|humid continental]]. In the northern part of the peninsula and on the mountains, winters are frosty and snowy, while summers are hot and dry. In the southern part winters are milder. The humid continental climate is predominant in Bosnia and Herzegovina, northern Croatia, Bulgaria, Kosovo, Macedonia, northern Montenegro, the interior of Albania, Romania and Serbia, while the other, less common climates, the humid subtropical and oceanic climates, are seen on the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria and Turkey; and the Mediterranean climate is seen on the coast of Albania, coast of Croatia, Greece, southern Montenegro and the Aegean coast of Turkey.

During the centuries many woods have been cut down and replaced with bush. In the southern part and on the coast there is evergreen vegetation. Inland there are woods typical of Central Europe ([[oak]] and [[beech]], and in the mountains, [[spruce]], [[fir]] and [[pine]]). The [[tree line]] in the mountains lies at the height of 1800–2300 m. The landscape provides [[habitat]]s for numerous endemic species, including extraordinarily abundant insects and reptiles that serve as food for a variety of [[birds of prey]] and rare [[vulture]]s.

The soils are generally poor, except on the plains where areas with natural grass, fertile soils and warm summers provide an opportunity for tillage. Elsewhere, land cultivation is mostly unsuccessful because of the mountains, hot summers and poor soils, although certain cultures such as [[olive]]s and grapes flourish.

Resources of energy are scarce, except in the territory of Kosovo, where considerable coal, lead, zinc, chromium, silver deposits are located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/3524092.stm |title=Regions and territories: Kosovo |publisher=BBC News |date=20 November 2009 |accessdate=17 April 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100415042620/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/country_profiles/3524092.stm| archivedate= 15 April 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other deposits of coal, especially in Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia and Bosnia also exist. [[Lignite]] deposits are widespread in Greece. Petroleum is most notably present in Romania, although scarce reserves exist in Greece, Serbia and Albania. Natural gas deposits are scarce. Hydropower is in wide use, with over 1,000 dams. The often relentless [[bora wind]] is also being harnessed for power generation.

Metal ores are more usual than other raw materials. Iron ore is rare but in some countries there is a considerable amount of copper, [[zinc]], [[tin]], [[chromite]], [[manganese]], [[magnesite]] and [[bauxite]]. Some metals are exported.

The time zones are situated as follows:
* Territories in the time zone of [[UTC+01:00]]: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia
* Territories in the time zone of [[UTC+02:00]]: Bulgaria, Greece, Romania and Turkey

{{Main|History of the Balkans}}

=== Antiquity ===
The Balkan region was the first area of Europe to experience the arrival of farming cultures in the [[Neolithic]] era. The practices of growing grain and raising livestock arrived in the Balkans from the [[Fertile Crescent]] by way of [[Anatolia]] and spread west and north into [[Pannonia]] and Central Europe.

The identity of the Balkans is dominated by its geographical position; historically the area was known as a crossroads of cultures. It has been a juncture between the [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] bodies of the [[Roman Empire]],{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} the destination of a massive influx of pagan [[Bulgars]] and [[Slavs]], an area where [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] and [[Catholic]] Christianity met,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Goldstein, I. |title=Croatia: A History |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the meeting point between [[Islam]] and Christianity.

In pre-classical and [[classical antiquity]], this region was home to [[Greeks]], [[Illyrians]], [[Paeonians]], [[Thracians]], [[Dacians]], and other ancient groups. The [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persian Empire]] incorporated parts of the Balkans comprising [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Thrace]], [[Bulgaria]], and the [[Black Sea]] coastal region of [[Romania]] between the late 6th and the first half of the 5th century BC into its territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=QsJ183uUDkMC&amp;pg=PA345&amp;lpg=PA345&amp;dq=Achaemenid+Persians+ruled+balkans&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=K7qasgPG1K&amp;sig=lkiajbVuNcHEbI5Lz3MnvIUBG1U&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sb6RVP2qHoPUaqeGgZgE&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Achaemenid%20Persians%20ruled%20balkans&amp;f=false|title=A Companion to Ancient Macedonia|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Classical Dictionary by Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth,ISBN 0-19-860641-9,&quot;page 1515,&quot;The Thracians were subdued by the Persians by 516&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Later the [[Roman Empire]] conquered most of the region and spread Roman culture and the [[Latin]] language, but significant parts still remained under [[Ancient Greece|classical Greek]] influence. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] considered the [[Rhodope Mountains]] to be the northern limit of the Peninsula of Haemus and the same limit applied approximately to the border between Greek and Latin use in the region (later called the [[Jireček Line]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/3063446 Boundary between Greek and Latin]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bulgars]] and [[Southern Slavs|Slavs]] arrived in the 6th century and began assimilating and displacing already-assimilated (through Romanization and Hellenization) older inhabitants of the northern and central Balkans, forming the [[Bulgarian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=f1F39vRlERAC&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Twenty Years of Balkan Tangle]''. Mary Edith Durham (2007). p.125. ISBN 1-4346-3426-4&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], the Balkans became the stage for a series of wars between the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Roman]] and the [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] Empires.

=== Early modern period ===
By the end of the 16th century, the Ottoman Empire had become the controlling force in the region after expanding from Anatolia through [[Thrace]] to the Balkans. Many people in the Balkans place their greatest folk heroes in the era of either the onslaught or the retreat of the Ottoman Empire.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} As examples, for Greeks, [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] and [[Kolokotronis]]; and for [[Serbs]], [[Miloš Obilić]] and [[Lazar Hrebeljanović|Tzar Lazar]]; for [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]], [[Đurađ I Balšić]] and [[Ivan Crnojević]]; for [[Albanians]], [[George Kastrioti Skanderbeg]]; for [[ethnic Macedonians]], [[Nikola Karev]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Considered a Bulgarian in Bulgaria&quot;&gt;Considered a Bulgarian in Bulgaria&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Goce Delčev]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Considered a Bulgarian in Bulgaria&quot;/&gt; and for [[Bulgarians]], [[Vasil Levski]], [[Georgi Sava Rakovski]] and [[Hristo Botev]].

In the past several centuries, because of the frequent [[Ottoman wars in Europe]] fought in and around the Balkans and the comparative Ottoman isolation from the mainstream of economic advance (reflecting the shift of Europe's commercial and political centre of gravity towards the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]), the Balkans has been the least developed part of Europe. According to Suraiya Faroqhi and Donald Quataert, &quot;The population of the Balkans, according to one estimate, [[Population decline|fell from a high of 8 million]] in the late 16th century to only 3 million by the mid-eighteenth. This estimate is in harmony with the first findings based on Ottoman documentary evidence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=c00jmTrjzAoC&amp;pg=PA652&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false An economic and social history of the Ottoman Empire]''. Suraiya Faroqhi, Donald Quataert (1997). [[Cambridge University Press]]. p.652. ISBN 0-521-57455-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Balkan nation-states emerged during the 19th and early 20th centuries as they gained independence from the Ottoman Empire or the Austro-Hungarian empire (Greece in 1821, Serbia, Montenegro and Romania in 1878, Bulgaria in 1908, Albania in 1912).

=== 20th century ===

==== World wars ====
In 1912–1913 the [[First Balkan War]] broke out when the nation-states of [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] and [[Kingdom of Montenegro|Montenegro]] united in an [[Balkan League|alliance]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]].  As a result of the war, almost all remaining European territories of the [[Ottoman Empire]] were captured and partitioned among the allies. Ensuing events also led to the creation of an independent [[Albania|Albanian state]]. Bulgaria insisted on its status quo territorial integrity, divided and shared by the Great Powers next to the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)]] in other boundaries and on the pre-war Bulgarian-Serbian agreement. Provoked by the backstage deals between its former allies Serbia and Greece on allocation the spoils at the end of the First Balkan War, while it fights at the main Thracian Front, Bulgaria marks the beginning of [[Second Balkan War]] when attacked them. The Serbs and the Greeks repulse single attacks, but when the Greek army invaded Bulgaria together with an unprovoked Romanian intervention in the back, regardless of the single won battles, Bulgaria collapsed. The Ottoman Empire also used the opportunity to recapture [[Eastern Thrace]], establishing its new western borders that still stand today.

The [[First World War]] was sparked in the Balkans in 1914 when [[Mlada Bosna]], a revolutionary organization with predominately Serbian and pro-Yugoslav members, [[assassination in Sarajevo|assassinated]] the Austro-Hungarian heir [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina's capital, [[Sarajevo]]. That caused a war between the two countries which—through the existing [[Allies of World War I|chains of alliances]]—led to the First World War. The Ottoman Empire soon joined the [[Central Powers]] becoming one of the three empires participating in that alliance. The next year Bulgaria joined the [[Central Powers]] attacking Serbia, which was successfully fighting Austro-Hungary to the north for a year. That led to Serbia's defeat and the intervention of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] in the Balkans which sent an expeditionary force to establish a new [[Macedonian front|front]], the third one of that war, which soon also became static. The participation of Greece in the war three years later, in 1918, on the part of the Entente finally altered the balance between the opponents leading to the collapse of the common German-Bulgarian front there, which caused the exit of Bulgaria from the war, and in turn the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, ending the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of World War I, Spencer Tucker, Priscilla Mary Roberts, p.242&lt;/ref&gt;

With the start of the [[Second World War]] all Balkan countries, with the exception of Greece, were allies of [[Nazi Germany]], having bilateral military agreements or being part of the [[Axis Pact]]. [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]] expanded the war in the Balkans by using its protectorate Albania to [[Greco-Italian War|invade Greece]]. After repelling the attack, the Greeks counterattacked, invading Italy-held Albania and causing Nazi Germany's intervention in the Balkans to help its ally.&lt;ref&gt;Europe in Flames, J. Klam, 2002, p.41&lt;/ref&gt; Days before the German invasion a successful coup d'état in Belgrade by neutral military personnel seized power.&lt;ref&gt;Russia's life-saver, Albert Loren Weeks, 2004, p.98&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the new government reaffirmed Serbia's intentions to fulfill its obligations as member of the Axis,&lt;ref&gt;Germany and the 2nd World War Volume III:The Mediterranean, south-east Europe, and north Africa, 1939–1941, Gerhard Schreiber, Bernd Stegemann, Detlef Vogel, 1995, p.484&lt;/ref&gt; Germany, using its other two allied countries in the region, Bulgaria and Hungary, invaded both Greece and Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia immediately disintegrated when those loyal to the Serbian King and the Croatian units mutinied.&lt;ref&gt;Germany and the 2nd World War Volume III:The Mediterranean, south-east Europe, and north Africa, 1939–1941, Gerhard Schreiber, Bernd Stegemann, Detlef Vogel, 1995, p.521&lt;/ref&gt; Greece resisted, but, after two months of fighting, collapsed and was occupied. The two countries were partitioned between the three Axis allies, Bulgaria, Germany and Italy, and the [[Independent State of Croatia]], a puppet state of Italy and Germany.

During the occupation the population suffered considerable hardship due to repression and starvation, to which the population reacted by creating a mass resistance movement.&lt;ref&gt;Inside Hitler's Greece:The Experience of Occupation, Mark Mazower, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the early and extremely heavy winter of that year (which caused hundreds of thousands deaths among the poorly fed population), the German invasion had disastrous effects in the timetable of the [[Operation Barbarossa|planned invasion in Russia]] causing a significant delay,&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Goring: Hitler's Second-In-Command, Fred Ramen, 2002, p.61&lt;/ref&gt; which had major consequences during the course of the war.&lt;ref&gt;The encyclopedia of codenames of World War II#Marita, Christopher Chant, 1986, p.125-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, at the end of 1944, the Soviets entered Romania and Bulgaria forcing the Germans out of the Balkans. They left behind a region largely ruined as a result of wartime exploitation, but by making use of the post-war separation of Germany into two independent entities, the German states successfully and legally avoided paying any reparations or repaying the forced loans given by the occupied countries.

==== Cold War ====

During the [[Cold War]], most of the countries on the Balkans were governed by communist governments. Greece became the first battleground of the emerging Cold War. The [[Truman Doctrine]] was the US response to the [[Greek Civil War|civil war]], which raged from 1944 to 1949. This civil war, unleashed by the [[Communist Party of Greece]], backed by communist volunteers from neighboring countries (Albania, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia), led to massive American assistance for the non-communist Greek government. With this backing, Greece managed to defeat the partisans and, ultimately, remained the only non-communist country in the region.

However, despite being under communist governments, [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] (1948) and Albania (1961) fell out with the Soviet Union. Yugoslavia, led by Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]] (1892–1980), first propped up then rejected the idea of merging with [[Bulgaria]] and instead sought closer relations with the West, later even spearheaded, together with India and Egypt the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. Albania on the other hand gravitated toward [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]], later adopting an [[isolationism|isolationist]] position.
[[File:Shkodra old bridge.jpg|220px|thumb|The [[Mes Bridge]] near [[Shkodër]], Albania, built by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in the 18th century]]
As the only non-communist countries, [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] were (and still are) part of [[NATO]] composing the southeastern wing of the alliance.

==== Post–Cold War ====
In the 1990s, the transition of the regions' ex-Soviet bloc countries towards democratic free-market societies went peacefully with the exception of Yugoslavia. [[Yugoslav wars|Wars between the former Yugoslav republics]] broke out after Slovenia and Croatia held free elections and their people voted for independence on their respective countries' referenda. Serbia in turn declared the dissolution of the union as unconstitutional and the [[Yugoslav People's Army|Yugoslavian army]] unsuccessfully tried to maintain status quo. Slovenia and Croatia declared independence on 25 June 1991, followed by the [[Ten-Day War]] in Slovenia. Till October 1991, the Army withdrew from Slovenia, and in Croatia, the [[Croatian War of Independence]] would continue [[Operation Storm|until 1995]]. In the ensuing 10 years armed confrontation, gradually all the other Republics declared independence, with [[Bosnian War|Bosnia being the most affected]] by the fighting. The long lasting wars resulted in a United Nations intervention and [[NATO intervention in Bosnia|NATO]] ground and air forces [[1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina|took action against Serb forces]] in Bosnia and Herzegovina and [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|Serbia]].

From the dissolution of Yugoslavia six republics achieved international recognition as sovereign republics, but these are traditionally included in Balkans: [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Serbia]]. In 2008, while under UN administration, Kosovo [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|declared independence]] (according to the official Serbian policy, Kosovo is still an internal autonomous region). In July 2010, the [[International Court of Justice]], ruled that the declaration of independence was legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kosovo independence declaration deemed legal|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/07/22/us-serbia-kosovo-idUSTRE66L01720100722|accessdate=16 February 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most UN member states recognise Kosovo. After the end of the wars a [[Overthrow of Slobodan Milošević|revolution]] broke in Serbia and [[Slobodan Milošević]], the Serbian communist leader (elected president between 1989 and 2000), was overthrown and handed for trial to the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|International Criminal Tribunal]] for crimes against the [[International Humanitarian Law]] during the Yugoslav wars. Milošević died of a heart attack in 2006 before a verdict could have been released. Ιn 2001 an [[Insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia|Albanian uprising]] in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] forced the country to give local autonomy to the [[Albanians in Macedonia|ethnic Albanians]] in the areas where they predominate.

With the dissolution of [[Yugoslavia]] an issue emerged over the name under which the former (federated) republic of Macedonia would internationally be recognized, between the new country and Greece. Being the [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonian part of Yugoslavia]] (see [[Vardar Macedonia]]), the federated Republic under the Yugoslav identity had the name [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|Republic of Macedonia]] on which it declared its sovereignty in 1991. Greece, having a large region (see [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]]) also under the same name opposed to the usage of this name as an indication of a nationality. The [[Macedonia naming dispute|issue]] is currently under negotiations after a UN initiation.

Balkan countries control the direct [[European route|land routes]] between Western Europe and South West Asia ([[Asia Minor]] and the Middle East). Since 2000, all Balkan countries are friendly towards the EU and the USA.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

[[Greece]] has been a member of the [[European Union]] since 1981; [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]] since 2007 and Croatia since 2013. In 2005, the European Union decided to start accession negotiations with candidate countries; [[Turkey]], and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] were accepted as candidates for European Union membership. In March 2004, [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]] have become members of [[NATO]]. As of April 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/news_52902.htm Ceremony marks the accession of [[Albania]] to NATO], NATO – News, 7 April 2009. Retrieved 18 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albania]] is a member of [[NATO]]. [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and what was then [[Serbia and Montenegro]] started negotiations with the EU over the Stabilization and Accession Agreements, although shortly after they started, negotiations with Serbia and Montenegro were suspended for lack of co-operation with the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]]. During the [[2008 Bucharest summit]] [[Greece]] vetoed Macedonia's NATO membership bid over the [[Macedonia naming dispute]] between the two countries{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}.

All other countries have expressed a desire to join the EU at some point in the future.

The [[Jewish]] communities of the Balkans were some of the oldest in Europe and date back to ancient times. These communities were [[Sephardi Jews]], except in [[Romania]] where the Jewish communities were [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. In [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], the small and close-knit Jewish community is 90% [[Sephardic]], and [[Judeo-Spanish|Ladino]] is still spoken among the elderly. The Sephardi Jewish cemetery in [[Sarajevo]] has tombstones of a unique shape and inscribed in ancient Ladino.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurojewcong.org/ejc/news.php?id_article=59 European Jewish Congress – Bosnia-Herzegovina], Accessed 15 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Sephardi Jews used to have a large presence in the city of [[Thessaloniki]], and by 1900, some 80,000, or more than half of the population, were Jews.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Greece.html Greece]&quot;. [[Jewish Virtual Library]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Jewish communities in the Balkans suffered immensely during [[World War II]], and the vast majority were killed during the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]]. An exception were the [[Bulgarian Jews]], most of whom were saved by [[Boris III of Bulgaria]], who resisted [[Adolf Hitler]], opposing their deportation to [[Nazi concentration camps]]. Almost all of the few survivors have emigrated to the (then) newly founded state of [[Israel]] and elsewhere. No Balkan country today has a significant Jewish minority.

=== Languages ===
{{main|Languages of the Balkans}}
{{further|Balkan sprachbund}}

The Balkan region today is a very diverse ethno-linguistic region, being home to multiple [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Romance languages|Romance]], and [[Turkic languages]], as well as [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], and others. [[Romani language|Romani]] is spoken by a large portion of the [[Romani people|Romanis]] living throughout the Balkan countries. Throughout history many other ethnic groups with their own languages lived in the area, among them [[Thracians]], [[Illyrians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Celts]] and various [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]]. All of the aforementioned languages from the present and from the past belong to the wider [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family, with the exception of the Turkic languages (e.g., [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]]).
