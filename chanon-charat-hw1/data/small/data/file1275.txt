Adamic language
      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Adamic language''' is, according to [[Jews]] (as recorded in the ''[[midrash]]im'') and some [[Christians]], the language spoken by [[Adam]] (and possibly [[Eve]]) in the [[Garden of Eden]]. It is variously interpreted as either the language used by [[God]] to address Adam (the [[divine language]]), or the language invented by Adam with which he named all things (including Eve), as in {{bibleref|Genesis|2:19|KJV}}.

Traditional Jewish exegesis such as [[Midrash]] ([[Genesis Rabbah]] 38) says that Adam spoke [[Hebrew]] because the names he gives Eve – &quot;''Isha''&quot; ([[Book of Genesis]] 2:23) and &quot;''Chava''&quot; (Genesis 3:20) – only make sense in Hebrew. By contrast, [[Kabbalism]] assumed an &quot;eternal Torah&quot; which was not identical to the Torah written in Hebrew. Thus, [[Abulafia]] in the 13th century assumed that the language spoken in Paradise had been different from Hebrew, and rejected the claim then current also among Christian authors, that a child left unexposed to linguistic stimulus would automatically begin to speak in Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;Eco (1993), p. 32 f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eco (1993) notes that Genesis is ambiguous on whether the language of Adam was preserved by Adam's descendants until the [[confusion of tongues]] (Genesis 11:1–9), or if it began to evolve naturally even before Babel (Genesis 10:5).&lt;ref&gt;Eco (1993), 7–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] addresses the topic in his ''[[De Vulgari Eloquentia]]''. He argues that the Adamic language is of divine origin and therefore unchangeable.&lt;ref&gt;Mazzocco, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes that according to Genesis, the first speech act is due to Eve, addressing the serpent, and not to Adam.&lt;ref&gt;''mulierem invenitur ante omnes fuisse locutam''. Eco (1993), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''[[Divina Commedia]]'', however, Dante changes his view to another that treats the Adamic language as the product of Adam.&lt;ref&gt;Mazzocco, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; This had the consequence that it could not any longer be regarded immutable, and hence Hebrew could not be regarded as identical with the language of Paradise. Dante concludes (''Paradiso'' XXVI) that Hebrew is a derivative of the language of Adam. In particular, the chief Hebrew name for God in scholastic tradition, ''[[El (god)|El]]'', must be derived of a different Adamic name for God, which Dante gives as ''[[Close front unrounded vowel|I]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Paradiso'' 26.133f.; Mazzocco, p. 178f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabethan scholar [[John Dee]] makes references to an [[occult]] or angelic language recorded in his private journals and those of [[spirit medium]] [[Edward Kelley]]. Dee's journals did not describe the language as &quot;[[Enochian]]&quot;, instead preferring &quot;Angelical&quot;, the &quot;Celestial Speech&quot;, the &quot;Language of Angels&quot;, the &quot;First Language of God-Christ&quot;, the &quot;Holy Language&quot;, or &quot;Adamical&quot; because, according to Dee's Angels, it was used by Adam in Paradise to name all things. The language was later dubbed Enochian, due to Dee's assertion that the [[Biblical Patriarch]] [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]] had been the last human (before Dee and Kelley) to know the language.

===Latter Day Saint movement===
[[Joseph Smith]], founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], in his [[Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible|revision of the Bible]], declared the Adamic language to have been &quot;pure and undefiled&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Moses]] [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/moses/6/6#6 6:6].&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Latter Day Saints]] believe it to be the language of [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;John S. Robertson, [http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/EoM&amp;CISOPTR=5449&amp;filename=5450.pdf &quot;Adamic Language&quot;], in ''[[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]]'' (New York: Macmillan) '''1''':18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other early Latter Day Saint leaders, including [[Brigham Young]],&lt;ref&gt;Brigham Young, [http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/MStar&amp;CISOPTR=7661&amp;filename=7662.pdf &quot;History of Brigham Young&quot;], ''[[Millennial Star]]'', vol. 25, no. 28, p. 439 (1863-07-11), cited in ''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' '''1''':297, footnote (Young prays in the Adamic tongue).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orson Pratt]],&lt;ref name = Pratt&gt;''[[Journal of Discourses]]'' [http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/JournalOfDiscourses3&amp;CISOPTR=1953&amp;filename=100504_170857_cp342_Va_M230_J82_v02.pdf '''2''':342] (God = &quot;Ahman&quot;; Son of God = &quot;Son Ahman&quot;; Men = &quot;Sons Ahman&quot;; Angel = &quot;Anglo-man&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elizabeth Ann Whitney]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Woman's Exponent]]'' [http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/WomansExp&amp;CISOPTR=6638&amp;filename=6639.pdf '''7''':83] (1 November 1878) (Whitney sings a hymn in the Adamic tongue).&lt;/ref&gt; claimed to have received several words in the Adamic language by [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]]. Some Latter Day Saints believe that the Adamic language is the &quot;pure language&quot; spoken of by [[Zephaniah]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Zephaniah|Zephaniah]] {{bibleverse-nb||Zephaniah|3:9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it will be restored as the universal language of humankind at the end of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oliver Cowdery]], [http://patriot.lib.byu.edu/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/NCMP1820-1846&amp;CISOPTR=10065&amp;filename=5298.pdf &quot;The Prophecy of Zephaniah&quot;], ''[[Evening and Morning Star]]'', vol. 2, no. 18, p. 142 (March 1834).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce R. McConkie]] (1966, 2d ed.). ''[[Mormon Doctrine]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft) p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ezra Taft Benson]] (1988). ''Teachings of Ezra Taft Benson'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: Bookcraft) p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Apostle (LDS Church)|Apostle]] [[Orson Pratt]] declared that &quot;Ahman&quot;, part of the name of the settlement &quot;[[Adam-ondi-Ahman]]&quot; in [[Daviess County, Missouri]], was the name of God in the Adamic language.&lt;ref name = Pratt/&gt; An 1832 handwritten page from  the [[Joseph Smith Papers]], titled &quot;A Sample of the Pure Language&quot;, and reportedly dictated by Smith to &quot;Br. Johnson&quot;, asserts that the name of God is ''Awmen''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://josephsmithpapers.org/paperDetails/sample-of-pure-language-circa-march-1832 &quot;Sample of the Pure Language&quot; ca. March 1832]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latter Day Saint [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|endowment]] [[prayer circle]] once included use of the words &quot;Pay Lay Ale&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith, ''The Mormon Murders'' (New York: St. Martins's Press, 1988) ISBN 0-312-93410-6, p. 69. &quot;the sign of the Second Token [is] raising both hands and then lowering them while repeating the incantation &quot;Pay Lay Ale&quot; three times&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; These untranslated words are no longer used in [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] [[Ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinances]] and have been replaced by an English version, &quot;O God, hear the words of my mouth&quot;.&lt;ref name = SLCM&gt;[http://www.utlm.org/newsletters/no76.htm &quot;Current Mormon Temple Ceremony Now Available&quot;], ''[[Salt Lake City Messenger]]'', no. 76, November 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that the &quot;Pay Lay Ale&quot; sentence is derived from the Hebrew phrase &quot;pe le-El&quot;, פה לאל &quot;mouth to God&quot;.&lt;ref name = SLCM/&gt;

Other words thought by some Latter Day Saints to derive from the Adamic language include ''[[Deseret (Book of Mormon)|deseret]]'' (&quot;honey bee&quot;), see [[Book of Ether|Ether]] [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/ether/2/3#3 2:3] and ''Ahman'' (&quot;God&quot;) see [[Doctrine and Covenants]] [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/doctrineandcovenants/78/20#20 78:20] 

The [[Book of Moses]] refers to &quot;a book of remembrance&quot; written in the language of Adam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/moses/6/5,46#5 Moses 6:5, 46].&lt;/ref&gt;
