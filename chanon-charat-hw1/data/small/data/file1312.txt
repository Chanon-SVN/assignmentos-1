'''Sir Philip Anthony Hopkins''', {{small|[[Order of the British Empire|CBE]]}} (born 31 December 1937) is a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] actor of film, stage, and television, and a composer and painter. After graduating from the [[Royal Welsh College of Music &amp; Drama]] in 1957, he trained at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] in London, and was then spotted by [[Laurence Olivier]] who invited him to join the [[Royal National Theatre]]. In 1968, he got his break in film in ''[[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|The Lion in Winter]]'', playing [[Richard I of England|Richard I]].

Other notable films include ''[[The Mask of Zorro]]'', ''[[The Bounty]]'', ''[[Meet Joe Black]]'', ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'', ''[[Magic (1978 film)|Magic]]'', ''[[84 Charing Cross Road (film)|84 Charing Cross Road]]'', ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'', ''[[Legends of the Fall]]'', ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', ''[[The Remains of the Day (film)|The Remains of the Day]]'', ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'', ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'', ''[[The World's Fastest Indian]]'', ''[[Instinct (film)|Instinct]]'', and ''[[Fracture (2007 film)|Fracture]]''.&lt;!--Do not add more titles to Rthis section. It's a sample, not a complete list.--&gt;

Along with his Academy Award, Hopkins has also won three [[BAFTA Award]]s, two [[Emmy Award|Emmys]] and the [[Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award|Cecil B. DeMille Award]]. In 1993, Hopkins was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] for services to the arts.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph&quot; /&gt; He received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 2003, and was made a [[BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award|Fellow]] of the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;daily&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;baft&quot; /&gt;

==Early life==
Hopkins was born in [[Margam]], [[Port Talbot]], [[Wales]], on 31 December 1937, the son of Annie Muriel (née Yeates) and Richard Arthur Hopkins, a baker.&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;&gt;Stated in interview on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His schooldays were unproductive; he found that he would rather immerse himself in art, such as painting and drawing, or playing the piano, than attend to his studies. In 1949, to instill discipline, his parents insisted he attend [[West Monmouth School|Jones' West Monmouth Boys' School]] in Pontypool, Wales. He remained there for five terms and was then educated at [[Cowbridge Grammar School]] in the [[Vale of Glamorgan]], Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;cowbridge&quot;&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1252033/Anthony-Hopkins.html Anthony Hopkins: My life in pictures] ''[[Daily Mail]]''; retrieved 6 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins was influenced and encouraged by Welsh compatriot [[Richard Burton]] (also born in Port Talbot), whom he met briefly at the age of 15. Hopkins promptly enrolled at the [[Royal Welsh College of Music &amp; Drama]] in [[Cardiff]], Wales, from which he graduated in 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph&quot;/&gt; After two years in the British Army doing his [[national service]], he moved to London, where he trained at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RADA&quot;&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/1998/dec/05/features A dark and stormy knight] ''[[The Guardian]]''; retrieved 6 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Roles===
Hopkins made his first professional stage appearance in the [[Palace Theatre, Swansea]], in 1960 with Swansea Little Theatre's production of ''Have a Cigarette''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Anthony Hopkins Biography|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/anthony-hopkins.html|publisher=[[Bio. (UK)]]|accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, after several years in repertory, he was spotted by [[Laurence Olivier|Lord Olivier]], who invited him to join the [[Royal National Theatre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph&quot;&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/nationaltreasures/2193352/Sir-Anthony-Hopkins-portrait.html Sir Anthony Hopkins portrait] ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''; retrieved 6 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins became Olivier's [[understudy]], and filled in when Olivier was struck with [[appendicitis]] during a production of [[August Strindberg]]'s ''The Dance of Death''. Olivier later noted in his memoir, ''Confessions of an Actor'', that &quot;A new young actor in the company of exceptional promise named Anthony Hopkins was understudying me and walked away with the part of Edgar like a cat with a mouse between its teeth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;falk&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Quentin|last=Falk|year=2004|title=Anthony Hopkins: The Biography|edition=4th|publisher=Virgin Books|isbn=0-7535-0999-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite his success at the National, Hopkins tired of repeating the same roles nightly and yearned to be in films. He made his small-screen debut in a 1967 BBC broadcast of ''[[A Flea in Her Ear]]''. In 1968, he got his break in ''[[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|The Lion in Winter]]'' playing [[Richard I of England|Richard I]]. Although Hopkins continued in theatre (most notably at the National Theatre as Lambert Le Roux in ''[[Pravda (play)|Pravda]]'' by [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]] and [[Howard Brenton]] and as Antony in ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' opposite [[Judi Dench]] as well as in the Broadway production of [[Peter Shaffer]]'s ''[[Equus (play)|Equus]]'', directed by [[John Dexter]]) he gradually moved away from it to become more established as a television and film actor. His [[Pierre Bezukhov]] for the BBC ''[[War and Peace (1972 TV series)|War and Peace]]'' (1972) was particularly memorable. In 1972 he portrayed WWI British Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] in ''[[Young Winston]]'', and in 1977 he played British Army officer [[John Frost (British Army officer)|John Frost]] in [[Richard Attenborough]]'s WWII film ''[[A Bridge Too Far (film)|A Bridge Too Far]]''. 

In 1980, he starred in ''[[The Elephant Man (film)|The Elephant Man]]'' as the English doctor [[Sir Frederick Treves, 1st Baronet|Sir Frederick Treves]], who attends to [[Joseph Merrick]] (portrayed by [[John Hurt]]), a severely deformed man in 19th century London. That year he also starred opposite [[Shirley MacLaine]] in ''[[A Change of Seasons (film)|A Change of Seasons]]'' and famously said “she was the most obnoxious actress I have ever worked with.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Films and filming&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Films and filming|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0kEbAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=5 June 2011|date=1 January 1989|publisher=Hansom Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, he starred opposite [[Mel Gibson]] in ''[[The Bounty]]'' as [[William Bligh]], captain of the Royal Navy ship the [[HMS Bounty|HMS ''Bounty'']], in a retelling of the  [[Mutiny on the Bounty|mutiny on the ''Bounty'']].

During the 1990s, Hopkins had the chance to work with [[Bart the Bear]] in two films: ''[[Legend of the Falls]]'' and ''[[The Edge (1997 film)|The Edge]]''.  According to trainer, Lynn Seuss, &quot;Tony Hopkins was absolutely brilliant with Bart...He acknowledged and respected him like a fellow actor. He would spend hours just looking at Bart and admiring him. He did so many of his own scenes with Bart.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foy|first=Paul|title=Bart the Bear, a veteran of several films, dies at 23|date=19 May 2000|publisher=''[[The Seattle Times]]''|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20000519&amp;slug=4021798|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins was Britain's highest paid performer in 1998, starring in ''[[The Mask of Zorro]]'' and ''[[Meet Joe Black]]'', and also agreed to reprise his role as Dr Hannibal Lecter for a fee of [[£]]15 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;IndependentHopkins&quot;/&gt;  In 2000, Hopkins narrated ''[[Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas (film)|Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas]]''. Hopkins received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;daily&quot;&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/happy-birthday-sir-anthony-hopkins/story-fn6ccwsa-1225978951467 Happy birthday Sir Anthony Hopkins] ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Australia)|The Daily Telegraph]]'' (Sydney). Retrieved 5 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins has stated that his role as [[Burt Munro]], whom he portrayed in his 2005 film ''[[The World's Fastest Indian]]'', was his favourite. He also asserted that Munro was the easiest role that he had played because both men have a similar outlook on life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.solarnavigator.net/films_movies_actors/the_worlds_fastest_indian.htm| publisher=Solarnavigator.net | title=''The World's Fastest Indian| accessdate=21 May 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070609023847/http://www.solarnavigator.net/films_movies_actors/the_worlds_fastest_indian.htm| archivedate= 9 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Hopkins was the recipient of the [[Golden Globe Cecil B.

The film was released on 23 November 2012. In 2013, he reprised his role as Odin in ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]''. In 2014, he portrayed [[Methuselah]] in [[Darren Aronofsky]]'s ''[[Noah (2014 film)|Noah]]''.

===Acting style===
[[File:I Rossellini A Hopkins.jpg|right|thumb|[[Isabella Rossellini]] and Sir Anthony Hopkins in Berlin to shoot scenes for ''[[The Innocent (1993 film)|The Innocent]]'' (1993)]]

Hopkins is renowned for his preparation for roles. He has indicated in interviews that once he has committed to a project, he will go over his lines as many times as is needed (sometimes upwards of 200) until the lines sound natural to him, so that he can &quot;do it without thinking&quot;. This leads to an almost casual style of delivery that belies the amount of groundwork done beforehand. While it can allow for some careful improvisation, it has also brought him into conflict with the occasional director who departs from the script, or demands what the actor views as an excessive number of takes. Hopkins has stated that after he is finished with a scene, he simply discards the lines, not remembering them later on. This is unlike others who usually remember their lines from a film even years later.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Anthony Hopkins: Lecter and Me&quot;&amp;nbsp;— ''Red Dragon'' DVD interview&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Attenborough]], who directed Hopkins on five occasions, found himself going to great lengths during the filming of ''[[Shadowlands (film)|Shadowlands]]'' (1993) to accommodate the differing approaches of his two stars (Hopkins and [[Debra Winger]]), who shared many scenes. Whereas Hopkins, preferring the spontaneity of a fresh take, liked to keep rehearsals to a minimum, Winger rehearsed continuously. To allow for this, Attenborough stood in for Hopkins during Winger's rehearsals, only bringing him in for the last one before a take. The director praised Hopkins for &quot;this extraordinary ability to make you believe when you hear him that it is the very first time he has ever said that line. It's an incredible gift.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;falk&quot; /&gt;

Renowned for his ability to remember lines, Hopkins keeps his memory supple by learning things by heart such as poetry, and Shakespeare. In Steven Spielberg's ''[[Amistad (film)|Amistad]]'', Hopkins astounded the crew with his memorisation of a seven-page courtroom speech, delivering it in one go. An overawed Spielberg couldn't bring himself to call him Tony, and insisted on addressing him as Sir Anthony throughout the shoot.&lt;ref name=&quot;RADA&quot; /&gt;

Hopkins is a gifted [[Impressionist (entertainment)|mimic]], adept at turning his native Welsh accent into whatever is required by a character. He duplicated the voice of his late mentor, Laurence Olivier, for additional scenes in ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' in its 1991 restoration. His interview on the 1998 relaunch edition of the British TV talk show ''[[Parkinson (TV series)|Parkinson]]'' featured an [[impersonation]] of comedian [[Tommy Cooper]]. Hopkins has said acting &quot;like a submarine&quot; has helped him to deliver credible performances in his thriller movies. He said, &quot;It's very difficult for an actor to avoid, you want to show a bit. But I think the less one shows the better.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8512396.stm |title=Sir Anthony Hopkins acts 'like a submarine' |publisher=BBC News  |date=12 February 2010 |accessdate=7 March 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hannibal Lecter===
Perhaps Hopkins' most famous role is as the cannibalistic serial killer [[Hannibal Lecter]] in ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', for which he won the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] in 1991, opposite [[Jodie Foster]] as [[Clarice Starling]], who also won for [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. The film won [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]]. It is one of the shortest lead performances to win an Oscar, as Hopkins appears on screen for only a little over 16 minutes, less than 14% of the film's running time.&lt;ref name=&quot;cowbridge&quot; /&gt; Hopkins reprised his role as Lecter twice in ''[[Hannibal (film)|Hannibal]]'' (2001) and ''[[Red Dragon (film)|Red Dragon]]'' (2002). His original portrayal of the character in ''The Silence of the Lambs'' has been labelled by the [[American Film Institute]] as the [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains|number-one film villain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/handv.aspx| publisher=AFI.com | title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains| accessdate=21 May 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070507035737/http://www.afi.com/tvevents/100years/handv.aspx &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 7 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time he was offered the role, Hopkins was making a return to the London stage, performing in ''[[M. Butterfly]]''. He had come back to Britain after living for a number of years in Hollywood, having all but given up on a career there, saying, &quot;Well that part of my life's over; it's a chapter closed. I suppose I'll just have to settle for being a respectable actor poncing around the West End and doing respectable BBC work for the rest of my life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;falk&quot; /&gt;

Hopkins played the iconic villain in adaptations of the first three of the Lecter novels by [[Thomas Harris]]. The author was reportedly very pleased with Hopkins' portrayal of his antagonist. However, Hopkins stated that ''[[Red Dragon (film)|Red Dragon]]'' would feature his final performance as the character, and that he would not reprise even a narrative role in the latest addition to the series, ''[[Hannibal Rising (film)|Hannibal Rising]]''.

These compositions include ''The Masque of Time'', given its world premiere with the [[Dallas Symphony Orchestra]] in October 2008, and ''Schizoid Salsa''.&lt;ref name=wmail-2008-10-20 /&gt;

In 1990, Hopkins directed a film about his Welsh compatriot, poet [[Dylan Thomas]], titled ''Dylan Thomas: Return Journey'', which was his directing debut for the screen. In 1996, he directed ''[[August (1996 film)|August]]'', an adaptation of [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]]'s ''[[Uncle Vanya]]'' set in Wales. His first screenplay, an experimental drama called ''[[Slipstream (2007 film)|Slipstream]]'', which he also directed and scored, premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 2007.

In 1997, Hopkins narrated BBC natural documentary series, ''[[Killing for a Living]]'', which showed predatory behaviour in nature. He narrated episode 1 through 3 before being replaced by [[John Shrapnel]].

Hopkins is a fan of the BBC sitcom ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'', and once remarked in an interview how he would love to appear in the series. Writer [[John Sullivan (writer)|John Sullivan]] saw the interview, and with Hopkins in mind created the character [[The Driscoll Brothers|Danny Driscoll]], a local villain. However, filming of the new series coincided with the filming of ''The Silence of the Lambs'', making Hopkins unavailable. The role instead went to [[Roy Marsden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Clark, Steve | title=The Only Fools and Horses Story| publisher=BBC Books| year=1998| isbn=0-563-38445-X | page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Hopkins released an album of classical music, entitled ''Composer'', performed by the [[City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra]] released by [[Decca Records|Decca]].
