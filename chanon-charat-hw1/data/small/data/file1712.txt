Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty''' ('''ABM Treaty''' or '''ABMT''') was a treaty between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] on the limitation of the [[anti-ballistic missile]] (ABM) systems used in defending areas against missile-delivered [[nuclear weapon]]s.  Under the terms of the treaty, each party was limited to two ABM complexes, each of which were to be limited to 100 anti-ballistic missiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Signed in 1972, it was in force for the next 30 years. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, in 1997 the United States and four former Soviet republics agreed to succeed to the treaty.  In June 2002 the United States withdrew from the treaty, leading to its termination.

==Background==
Throughout the late 1950s and into the 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union had been developing a series of missile systems with the ability to shoot down incoming [[ICBM]] warheads.  During this period the US considered the defense of the US as a part of reducing the overall damage inflicted in a full nuclear exchange.  As part of this defense, [[Canada]] and the US established the North American Air Defense Command (now called North American Aerospace Defense Command [[NORAD]]).

By the early 1950s, US research on the [[Project Nike|Nike Zeus]] missile system had developed to the point where small improvements would allow it to be used as the basis of a &quot;real&quot; ABM system. Work started on a short-range, high-speed counterpart known as the [[Sprint (missile)|Sprint]] to provide defense for the ABM sites themselves. By the mid-1960s, both systems showed enough promise to start development of base selection for a limited ABM system dubbed 'Sentinel'.  In 1967 it was announced that Sentinel itself would be scaled down to the smaller and less expensive [[Safeguard Program]].  Soviet doctrine called for development of their own ABM system and return to strategic parity with the US. This was achieved with the operational deployment of the [[A-35 anti-ballistic missile system|A-35 ABM system]] and its successors, which remain operational to this day. 

The development of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle ([[MIRV]]) systems allowed a single ICBM to deliver as many as ten separate warheads at a time.  An ABM defense system could be overwhelmed with the sheer number of warheads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

To further protect against ABM systems, the Soviet MIRV missiles were equipped with decoys - [[R-36 (missile)|R-36M]] heavy missiles were carrying as many as 40 of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Decoys&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/russia/article/0,2763,777379,00.html|title=Moscow extends life of 144 cold war ballistic missiles| accessdate = 2006-10-24|work=The Guardian | location=London | date=August 20, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; These decoys would appear as warheads to ABM, effectively requiring engagement of 5 times more targets than before and rendering defense even less effective.

==ABM Treaty==
The United States first proposed an anti-ballistic missile treaty at the 1967 [[Glassboro Summit Conference]] during discussions between U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Robert McNamara]] and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union [[Alexei Kosygin]].  McNamara argued both that ballistic missile defense could provoke an arms race, and that it might provoke a first-strike against the nation fielding the defense. Kosygin rejected this reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|quote=Although Kosygin rejected this reasoning at Glassboro}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the proposal of the Sentinel and Safeguard decisions on American ABM systems, the [[SALT I|Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] began in November 1969 (SALT I). By 1972 an agreement had been reached to limit strategic defensive systems. Each country was allowed two sites at which it could base a defensive system, one for the capital and one for ICBM silos.   

The treaty was signed during the [[Moscow Summit (1972)|1972 Moscow Summit]] on May 26 by the [[President of the United States]], [[Richard Nixon]] and the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Leonid Brezhnev]]; and ratified by the US Senate on August 3, 1972.

The 1974 Protocol reduced the number of sites to one per party, largely because neither country had developed a second site.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAS reference&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=ABM treaty reduces US and USSR to one ABM site each|url=http://www.fas.org/nuke/control/abmt/|accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The sites were [[Moscow]] for the USSR and the North Dakota [[Stanley R. Mickelsen Safeguard Complex|Safeguard Complex]] for the US, which was already under construction.

===Missiles limited by the treaty===
The Treaty limited only ABMs capable of defending against &quot;strategic ballistic missiles&quot;, without attempting to define &quot;strategic&quot;. It was understood that both ICBMs and [[SLBM]]s are obviously &quot;strategic&quot;.&lt;ref name=Daalder&gt;{{cite journal|title=A tactical defence initiative for the Western Europe?|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|date=May 1987|volume=43|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=pgYAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=ICBM%20SDI%20ABM%20treaty%20%22strategic%20ballistic%20missiles%22%20or%20their%20elements%20in%20flight%20trajectory&amp;pg=PA37#v=onepage&amp;q=ICBM%20SDI%20ABM%20treaty%20%22strategic%20ballistic%20missiles%22%20or%20their%20elements%20in%20flight%20trajectory&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 February 2011|author=Ivo H. Daalder|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both countries did not intend to stop the development of counter-tactical ABMs. The topic became disputable as soon as most potent counter-tactical ABMs started to be capable of shooting down SLBMs (SLBMs naturally tend to be much slower than ICBMs), nevertheless both sides continued counter-tactical ABM development.&lt;ref name=Daalder /&gt;

==After the SDI announcement==
On March 23, 1983 [[Ronald Reagan]] announced the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]], a research program into ballistic missile defense which would be, &quot;consistent with our obligations under the ABM Treaty&quot;.  The project was a blow to [[Yuri Andropov]]'s so-called &quot;peace offensive&quot;. Andropov said that &quot;It is time they [Washington] stopped... search[ing] for the best ways of unleashing nuclear war... Engaging in this is not just irresponsible. It is insane&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pravda]], March 27, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the opposition, Reagan gave every indication that SDI would not be used as a bargaining chip and that the United States would do all in its power to build the system. The Soviets were threatened because the Americans might have been able to make a nuclear first strike possible. In ''The Nuclear Predicament,'' Beckman claims that one of the central goals of Soviet diplomacy was to terminate SDI. A surprise attack from the Americans would destroy much of the Soviet ICBM fleet, allowing SDI to defeat a “ragged” Soviet retaliatory response. Furthermore, if the Soviets chose to enter this new arms race, they would further cripple their economy.  The Soviets could not afford to ignore Reagan’s new endeavor, therefore their policy at the time was to enter negotiations with the Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Peter R.

Graebner, Richard Dean Burns, and Joseph M. Siracusa, ''Reagan, Bush, Gorbachev: Revisiting the End of the Cold War,'' p. 95, 2008.

SDI research went ahead, although it did not achieve the hoped-for result. SDI research was cut back following the end of Reagan's presidency, and in 1995 it was reiterated in a presidential joint statement that &quot;missile defense systems may be deployed... [that] will not pose a realistic threat to the strategic nuclear force of the other side and will not be tested to... [create] that capability.&quot;  This was reaffirmed in 1997.

==US withdrawal==
Although the Soviet Union ceased to exist in December 1991, in the view of the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]], the treaty continued in force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|quote=Although the ABM Treaty continues in force, it nevertheless has become necessary to reach agreement as to which New Independent States (NIS) would collectively assume the rights and obligations of the USSR under the Treaty.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An additional memorandum of understanding was prepared in 1997, establishing Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine as successor states to the Soviet Union, for the purposes of the treaty.

On December 13, 2001, [[George W. Bush]] gave [[Russia]] notice of the United States' withdrawal from the treaty, in accordance with the clause that required six months' notice before terminating the pact—the first time in recent history that the United States has withdrawn from a major international arms treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Withdrawal From the ABM Treaty: President Bush’s Remarks and U.S. Diplomatic Notes|url=http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2002_01-02/docjanfeb02|publisher=Arms Control Association|accessdate=10 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to the eventual creation of the American [[Missile Defense Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/12/20011213-2.html &quot;Announcement of Withdrawal from the ABM Treaty&quot;, White House press release]&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the withdrawal argued that it was a necessity in order to test and build a limited [[National Missile Defense]] to protect the United States from [[nuclear blackmail]] by a [[rogue state]]. The withdrawal had many critics as well as supporters. John Rhinelander, a negotiator of the ABM treaty, predicted that the withdrawal would be a &quot;fatal blow&quot; to the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] and would lead to a &quot;world without effective legal constraints on [[nuclear proliferation]].&quot; The construction of a missile defense system was also feared to enable the US to attack with a nuclear first strike.

Russia and the United States signed the [[Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty]] in Moscow on May 24, 2002. This treaty mandates cuts in deployed strategic nuclear warheads, but without actually mandating cuts to total stockpiled warheads, and without any mechanism for enforcement.
