Often, strong views are expressed with regard to anal sex; it is controversial in various cultures, especially concerning [[religion]], commonly due to prohibitions against anal sex among gay men or teachings about the [[Reproduction|procreative]] purpose of sexual activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dean and Delvin&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LeRoy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Discovery.com&quot;/&gt; It may be regarded as [[taboo]] or unnatural, and is a [[Crime|criminal offense]] in some countries, punishable by [[Corporal punishment|corporal]] or [[capital punishment]]; by contrast, people also regard anal sex as a natural and valid form of sexual activity that may be as fulfilling as other desired sexual expressions.

The anal sphincters are usually tighter than the [[pelvic floor|pelvic muscles]] of the vagina, which can enhance the sexual pleasure for the inserting male during male-to-female anal intercourse because of the pressure applied to the penis.&lt;ref name=&quot;WebMD&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Taormino&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Understanding&quot;/&gt; Men may also enjoy the penetrative role during anal sex because of its association with dominance, because it is made more alluring by a female or general society insisting that it is forbidden, or because it presents an additional option for penetration.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeRoy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Understanding&quot;/&gt;

While some women find being a receptive partner during anal intercourse painful or uncomfortable, or only engage in the act to please a male sexual partner, other women find the activity pleasurable or prefer it to [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal intercourse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McBride and Fortenberry&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Taormino&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howe&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author = Adrian Howe | title = Sex, Violence and Crime: Foucault and the 'Man' Question| publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 2008 | page = 35 | accessdate = July 16, 2013 |isbn = 0203891279| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=W6aoQfurvT4C&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Alters and Schiff&quot;&gt;{{cite book| authors = Sandra Alters, Wendy Schiff | title = Essential Concepts for Healthy Living| publisher = [[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers]] | year = 2012 | page = 144 | accessdate = July 16, 2013 |isbn = 1449630626| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=VegUiVbruBMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vaginal walls contain significantly fewer nerve endings than the clitoris and anus, and therefore intense sexual pleasure, including orgasm, from vaginal sexual stimulation is less likely to occur than from direct clitoral stimulation in the majority of women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kilchevsky&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sex and Society&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Can't feel&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = I'm a woman who cannot feel pleasurable sensations during intercourse|publisher = [[Go Ask Alice!]] | date = October 8, 2004 (Last Updated/Reviewed on October 17, 2008)| accessdate = September 13, 2012|url=http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/im-woman-who-cannot-feel-pleasurable-sensations-during-intercourse |archivedate= January 7, 2011|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110107184029/http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/3229.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, anal sexual stimulation is not necessarily more likely to result in orgasm than vaginal sexual stimulation; the types of nerves and how they interact with each other are factors,&lt;ref name=&quot;Answer&quot;/&gt; as &quot;total separation between the vagina and clitoris is mostly artificial, and often based on a misunderstanding of what, where, and how big the clitoris really is&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Connell&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Difference&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kilchevsky&quot;/&gt;

In a 2010 clinical review article of heterosexual anal sex, the term ''anal intercourse'' is used to refer specifically to penile-anal penetration, and ''anal sex'' is used to refer to any form of anal sexual activity. The review suggests that anal sex is exotic among the sexual practices of some heterosexuals and that &quot;for a certain number of heterosexuals, anal intercourse is pleasurable, exciting, and perhaps considered more intimate than vaginal sex&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;McBride and Fortenberry&quot;/&gt;

Anal intercourse is sometimes used as a substitute for vaginal intercourse during [[menstruation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LeRoy&quot;/&gt; The likelihood of [[pregnancy]] occurring&lt;!-- NOTE: This paragraph, including this line, relates to practice far more than it does to health, so it seemingly fits better here than in the Health risks section. --&gt; during anal sex is greatly reduced, as anal sex alone cannot lead to pregnancy unless sperm is somehow transported to the vaginal opening. Because of this, some couples practice anal intercourse as a form of [[Birth control|contraception]], often in the absence of a condom.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeRoy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Crooks&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SIECUS ''Prevalence of Unprotected Anal Sex among Teens Requires New Education Strategies&quot;[http://www.sexedlibrary.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Feature.showFeature&amp;featureid=1036&amp;pageid=682&amp;parentid=478] Accessed January 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Male-to-female anal sex is commonly viewed as a way of preserving female [[virginity]] because it is non-procreative and does not tear the [[hymen]]; a person, especially a female, who engages in anal sex or other sexual activity with no history of having engaged in vaginal intercourse is often regarded among heterosexuals and researchers as not having yet experienced virginity loss.

===Prevalence===

In 1992, a study conducted by the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) found that 26% of men 18 to 59 and 20% of women 18 to 59 had engaged in heterosexual anal sex; a similar 2005 survey (also conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) found a rising incidence of anal sex relations in the American heterosexual population. The survey showed that 40% of men and 35% of women between 25 and 44 had engaged in heterosexual anal sex.&lt;ref&gt;William D. Mosher, PhD; Anjani Chandra, PhD; and Jo Jones, PhD, [http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/ad/ad362.pdf Sexual Behavior and Selected Health Measures: Men and Women 15–44 Years of Age], U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH &amp; HUMAN SERVICES, Division of Vital Statistics, September 15, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of overall numbers of survey respondents, seven times as many women as gay men said that they engaged in anal intercourse, with this figure reflecting the larger heterosexual population size.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne-Christine d'Adesky]], ''Expanding Microbicide Research'' in amfAR Global Link&amp;nbsp;– Treatment Insider; May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 report regarding the prevalence and correlates of heterosexual anal and oral sex among adolescents and adults in the United States, a National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) found that 34% men and 30% women reported ever participating in heterosexual anal sex. The percentage of participants reporting heterosexual anal sex was significantly higher among 20- to 24-year-olds and peaked among 30- to 34-year-olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=18190267 | doi=10.1086/522867 | volume=196 | issue=12 | title=Prevalence and correlates of heterosexual anal and oral sex in adolescents and adults in the United States |date=December 2007 | journal=J. Infect. Dis. | pages=1852–9 | author=Leichliter JS, Chandra A, Liddon N, Fenton KA, Aral SO}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 survey focused on a younger demographic of teenagers and young adults, aged 15–21. It found that 16% of 1350 surveyed had had this type of sex in the previous 3 months, with condoms being used 29% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/18245402/detail.html#- |title=Bradley Hasbro Children's Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, given the subject matter, the survey hypothesized the prevalence was probably underestimated.&lt;!-- A direct quote would be preferable here --&gt;

In Kimberly R. McBride's 2010 clinical review on heterosexual anal intercourse and other forms of anal sexual activity, it is suggested that changing [[Norm (social)|norms]] may affect the frequency of heterosexual anal sex. McBride and her colleagues investigated the prevalence of non-intercourse anal sex behaviors among a sample of men (n=1,299) and women (n=1,919) compared to anal intercourse experience and found that 51% of men and 43% of women had participated in at least one act of oral–anal sex, manual–anal sex, or anal sex toy use.&lt;ref name=&quot;McBride and Fortenberry&quot;/&gt; The report states the majority of men (n=631) and women (n=856) who reported heterosexual anal intercourse in the past 12 months were in exclusive, monogamous relationships: 69% and 73%, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;McBride and Fortenberry&quot;/&gt; The review added that &quot;most research on anal intercourse addresses men who have sex with men (MSM), with relatively little attention given to anal intercourse and other anal sexual behaviors between heterosexual partners&quot; and &quot;[r]esearch is quite rare that specifically differentiates the anus as a sexual organ or addresses anal sexual function or dysfunction as legitimate topics. As a result, we do not know the extent to which anal intercourse differs qualitatively from coitus.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McBride and Fortenberry&quot;/&gt;

According to a 2010 study from the [[National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior]] (NSSHB) that was authored by [[Debby Herbenick]] and other researchers, although anal intercourse is reported by fewer women than other partnered sex behaviors, partnered women in the age groups between 18–49 are significantly more likely to report having anal sex in the past 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalsexstudy.indiana.edu/ National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior (NSSHB).] Findings from the National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior, Center for Sexual Health Promotion, Indiana University.

Figures for prevalence can vary among different demographics, regions and nationalities.

Figures for the prevalence of sexual behavior can also fluctuate over time. Edward O. Laumann's 1992 survey, reported in ''The Social Organization of Sexuality: Sexual Practices in the United States'', found that about 20% of heterosexuals had engaged in male-to-female anal sex. [[Sexology|Sex researcher]] [[Alfred Kinsey]], working in the 1940s, had found that number to be closer to 40% at the time.

Historically, anal sex has been commonly associated with male homosexuality. However, many gay men and [[men who have sex with men]] in general (those who identify as gay, [[Bisexuality|bisexual]], heterosexual or have not identified their [[sexual identity]]) do not engage in anal sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Not all&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wellings&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson and Johnson&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Gay Perspective: Things Our Homosexuality Tells Us about the Nature of God &amp; the Universe|isbn = 978-1-59021-015-4 |publisher=[[Lethe Press]]|year=2008|page=139|accessdate=February 12, 2011|url=http://books.google.com/?id=LPyhsuVbUlAC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author =Edwin Clark Johnson, [[Toby Johnson]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldstone&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =  Goldstone| first1 =Stephen E. | last2 = Welton| first2 = Mark L.| year = 2004 | title = Sexually Transmitted Diseases of the Colon, Rectum, and Anus| journal = Clin Colon Rectal Surg | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 235–239| doi = | pmc=2780055 | pmid=20011265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among men who have anal sex with other men, the insertive partner may be referred to as the ''[[Top (sex)|top]]'' and the one being penetrated may be referred to as the ''[[Bottom (sex)|bottom]]''.

===Prevalence===
Reports with regard to the prevalence of anal sex among gay men in the West have varied over time. Magnus Hirschfeld, in his 1914 work, ''The Homosexuality of Men and Women'', reported the rate of anal sex among gay men surveyed to be 8%, the least favored of all the practices documented.&lt;ref&gt;William A. Percy and John Lauritsen, Review in ''The Gay &amp; Lesbian Review'', November–December 2002&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1950s in the United Kingdom, it was thought that about 15% of gay males had anal sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyde&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author =Harford Montgomery Hyde|title=The Love that Dared Not Speak Its Name: A Candid History of Homosexuality in Britain|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company|Little, Brown]]|year=1970|pages=6–7|isbn=|accessdate=August 19, 2013|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mBkbAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=The+Love+That+Dared+not+Speak+its+Name+1970&amp;dq=The+Love+That+Dared+not+Speak+its+Name+1970&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5agSUpDaEuWM2QXl-IGgBw&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the Hirschfeld study, scholars state that oral sex and mutual masturbation are more common than anal stimulation among gay men in long-term relationships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Not all&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson and Johnson&quot;/&gt; They say that anal intercourse is generally more popular among gay male couples than among heterosexual couples, but that &quot;it ranks behind oral sex and mutual masturbation&quot; among both sexual orientations in prevalence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weiten&quot;/&gt; Wellings et al. reported that &quot;[t]he equation of 'homosexual' with 'anal' sex among men is common among lay and health professionals alike&quot; and that &quot;[y]et an Internet survey of 18,000 MSM across Europe (EMIS, 2011) showed that oral sex was most commonly practised, followed by mutual masturbation, with anal intercourse in third place&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wellings&quot;/&gt; A 2011 survey by ''[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]'' found similar results for U.S. gay and bisexual men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02438.x/abstract Sexual Behaviors and Situational Characteristics of Most Recent Male-Partnered Sexual Event among Gay and Bisexually Identified Men in the United States] onlinelibrary.wiley.com Retrieved 2-13-2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Various older studies on male-to-male anal sex differ significantly. The 1994 Laumann study suggests that 80% of gay men practice anal sex and 20% never engage in it at all.&lt;ref&gt;Laumann, E., Gagnon, J.H., Michael, R.T., and Michaels, S. The Social Organization of Sexuality: Sexual Practices in the United States. 1994. Chicago: University of Chicago Press (Also reported in the companion volume, Michael et al., Sex in America: A Definitive Survey, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; A survey in ''[[The Advocate]]'' in 1994 indicated that 46% of gay men preferred to penetrate their partners, while 43% preferred to be the receptive partner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Underwood&quot;/&gt; A survey conducted from 1994 to 1997 in San Francisco by the [[Stop AIDS Project]] indicated that over the course of the study, among men who have sex with men instead of solely gay men, the proportion engaging in anal sex increased from 57.6% to 61.2%.&lt;ref name = &quot;cdc.gov-Rectal&quot;&gt;Center for Disease Control, ''Increases in Unsafe Sex and Rectal Gonorrhea Among Men Who Have Sex With Men&amp;nbsp;– San Francisco, California, 1994–1997''[http://www.cdc.gov/mmwR/preview/mmwrhtml/00056314.htm].

Women may sexually stimulate a man's anus by fingering the exterior or interior areas of the anus; they may also stimulate the [[perineum]] (which, for males, is between the base of the [[scrotum]] and the anus), [[prostate massage|massage the prostate]] or engage in anilingus.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeRoy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zdrok&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Keesling&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=Barbara|last=Keesling| title = Sexual Pleasure: Reaching New Heights of Sexual Arousal and Intimacy | publisher =[[Hunter House Publishers|Hunter House]]|year = 2005|page=221|accessdate = July 6, 2013| isbn = 9780897934350 |url =http://books.google.com/books?id=EG2qGvbgneoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Up4eUpHaEMu_sASniICoCw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex toys, such as a [[dildo]], may also be used.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeRoy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zdrok&quot;/&gt; The practice of a woman penetrating a man's anus with a [[strap-on dildo]] for sexual activity is called [[Pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hawley&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Dan|last=Savage|title=We Have a Winner!|publisher=''[[The Stranger (newspaper)|The Stranger]]''|date=June 21, 2001|accessdate=July 5, 2013 2011|url=http://thestranger.com/seattle/SavageLove?oid=7730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly, heterosexual men reject the idea of being receptive partners during anal sex because they believe it is a [[Femininity|feminine]] act, can make them vulnerable, or contradicts their sexual orientation (for example, that it is indicative that they are gay).&lt;ref name=&quot;Zdrok&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Odets&quot;/&gt; National Institutes of Health (NIH) information published in the ''BMJ'' in 1999, however, states:&lt;blockquote&gt;There are little published data on how many heterosexual men would like their anus to be sexually stimulated in a heterosexual relationship. Anecdotally, it is a substantial number. What data we do have almost all relate to penetrative sexual acts, and the superficial contact of the anal ring with fingers or the tongue is even less well documented but may be assumed to be a common sexual activity for men of all sexual orientations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robin Bell&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is less research on anal sexual activity among [[women who have sex with women]] compared to couples of other sexual orientations. In 1987, a non-scientific study (Munson) was conducted of more than 100 members of a lesbian social organization in Colorado. When asked what techniques they used in their last ten sexual encounters, lesbians in their 30s were twice as likely as other age groups to engage in anal stimulation (with a finger or dildo).&lt;ref name=Carroll/&gt; While author Tom Boellstorff, when particularly examining anal sex among gay and lesbian individuals in Indonesia, stated that he had not heard of oral-anal contact or anal penetration as recognized forms of lesbian sexuality but assume they take place,&lt;ref name=&quot;Boellstorff&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author =Tom Boellstorff|title=The Gay Archipelago: Sexuality and Nation in Indonesia|isbn = 978-0-691-12334-9 |publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2005|pages=101–102|accessdate=March 12, 2011|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Whr4Tb0EuZUC&amp;pg=PA101}}&lt;/ref&gt; author [[Felice Newman]], in ''[[The Whole Lesbian Sex Book: A Passionate Guide for All of Us|The Whole Lesbian Sex Book]],'' cites anal sex as a part of lesbian sexual practices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newman&quot;/&gt;

===General risks===

Anal sex can expose its participants to two principal dangers: infections due to the high number of infectious [[microorganism]]s not found elsewhere on the body, and physical damage to the anus and rectum due to their fragility.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krasner&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Werner&quot;/&gt; Increased experimentation with anal sex by people without sound knowledge about risks and what safety measures do and do not work may be linked to an increase in [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs/STDs); for example, teenagers may consider vaginal intercourse riskier than anal intercourse and believe that a STI can only result from the former activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;James&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = .Study Reports Anal Sex on Rise Among Teens | first = Susan | last = Donaldson James | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=6428003&amp;page=1 | publisher = [[ABC News]] | date = December 10, 2008 | accessdate =January 6, 2011 | quote = But experts say that as social mores ease, more young heterosexuals are engaging in anal sex, a behavior once rarely mentioned in polite circles.

Though anal sex alone does not lead to pregnancy, pregnancy can still occur with anal sex or other forms of sexual activity if the penis is near the vagina (such as during [[intercrural sex]] or other [[Sex position#Genital-genital rubbing|genital-genital rubbing]]) and its sperm is deposited near the vagina's entrance and travels along the vagina's lubricating fluids; the risk of pregnancy can also occur without the penis being near the vagina because sperm may be transported to the vaginal opening by the vagina coming in contact with fingers or other non-genital body parts that have come in contact with semen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=R.

===Physical damage and cancer===

It is uncommon for serious physical injury to occur as a result of anal sex,&lt;ref name=&quot;WebMD&quot;/&gt; but anal sex can exacerbate [[hemorrhoid]]s and therefore result in bleeding; if bleeding occurs, it may also be a result of a tear in the anal or rectal tissues or [[perforation]] (a hole) in the [[Large intestine|colon]], the latter of which being a serious medical issue that should be remedied by immediate medical attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;WebMD&quot;/&gt; Because of the rectum's lack of elasticity, the anal [[mucous membrane]] being thin, and small [[blood vessel]]s being present directly beneath the mucous membrane, tiny tears and bleeding in the rectum usually result from penetrative anal sex, though the bleeding is usually minor and therefore usually not visible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Werner&quot;/&gt; By contrast to other anal sexual behaviors, anal fisting poses a more serious danger of damage due to the deliberate stretching of the anal and rectal tissues; anal fisting injuries include anal sphincter lacerations and rectal and [[sigmoid colon]] (rectosigmoid) perforation, which might result in death.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeRoy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot; Miletich&quot;&gt;{{cite book|authors=John J.

Repetitive penetrative anal sex may result in the anal sphincters becoming weakened, which may affect the ability to hold in feces (a condition known as [[fecal incontinence]]); [[Kegel exercise]]s have been used to strengthen the anal sphincters and overall [[pelvic floor]], and may help prevent or remedy fecal incontinence.&lt;ref name=&quot;WebMD&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid22161382&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hagen S, Stark D |title=Conservative prevention and management of pelvic organ prolapse in women |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=12 |issue= 12|pages=CD003882 |year=2011 |pmid=22161382 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003882.pub4}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1993 study indicated that fourteen out of a sample of forty men receiving anal intercourse experienced episodes of frequent fecal incontinence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jrsm.org/cgi/content/abstract/86/3/144 Effect of anoreceptive intercourse on anorectal function] AJ Miles, TG Allen-Mersh and C Wastell, Department of Surgery, Westminster Hospital, London; in ''Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine'' Vol 86, Issue 3 144–147; 1993. Retrieved April 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 1997 study found no difference in levels of fecal incontinence between gay men who engaged in anal sex and heterosexual men who did not, and criticized the earlier study for its inclusion of [[flatulence]] in its definition of fecal incontinence.&lt;ref&gt;Chun AB, Rose S, Mitrani C, Silvestre AJ, Wald A: Anal sphincter structure and function in homosexual males engaging in anal receptive intercourse.

Most cases of anal cancer are related to infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV). Anal sex alone does not cause anal cancer; the risk of anal cancer through anal sex is attributed to HPV infection, which is often contracted through unprotected anal sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anal cancer&quot;/&gt; Anal cancer is relatively rare, and significantly less common than cancer of the colon or rectum ([[colorectal cancer]]); the [[American Cancer Society]] states that it affects approximately 7,060 people (4,430 in women and 2,630 in men) and results in approximately 880 deaths (550 in women and 330 in men) in the United States, and that, though anal cancer has been on the rise for many years, it is mainly diagnosed in adults, &quot;with an average age being in the early 60s&quot; and it &quot;affects women somewhat more often than men.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anal cancer&quot;/&gt; Though anal cancer is serious, treatment for it is &quot;often very effective&quot; and most anal cancer patients can be cured of the disease; the American Cancer Society adds that &quot;receptive anal intercourse also increases the risk of anal cancer in both men and women, particularly in those younger than the age of 30. Because of this, men who have sex with men have a high risk of this cancer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Anal cancer&quot;/&gt;

In later [[Greek literature#Roman Age|Roman-era Greek poetry]], anal sex became a common literary convention, represented as taking place with &quot;eligible&quot; youths: those who had attained the proper age but had not yet become adults. Seducing those not of proper age (for example, non-adolescent children) into the practice was considered very shameful for the adult, and having such relations with a male who was no longer adolescent was considered more shameful for the young male than for the one mounting him; Greek courtesans, or [[hetaera]]e, are said to have frequently practiced heterosexual anal intercourse as a means of preventing pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = James E.|year = 1995 | title = The Practices of Romans 1:26: Homosexual or Heterosexual? | url = | journal = Novum Testamentum | volume = 37 | issue = 1| page = 9 | quote = Heterosexual anal intercourse is best illustrated in Classical vase paintings of hetaerae with their clients, and some scholars interpret this as a form of contraception | doi=10.1163/1568536952613631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A male citizen taking the passive (or receptive) role in anal intercourse was condemned in Rome as an act of ''impudicitia'' (immodesty or un[[chastity]]); free men, however, frequently took the active role with a young male slave, known as a ''[[catamite]]'' or ''puer delicatus''. The latter was allowed because anal intercourse was considered equivalent to vaginal intercourse in this way; men were said to &quot;take it like a woman&quot; (muliebria pati, &quot;to undergo womanly things&quot;) when they were anally penetrated, but when a man performed anal sex on a woman, she was thought of as playing the boy's role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skinner&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title =Invading the Roman Body: Manliness and Impenetrability in Roman Thought.

===Western cultures===
In many Western countries, anal sex has generally been taboo since the [[Middle Ages]], when [[heresy in Christianity|heretical]] movements were sometimes attacked by accusations that their members practiced anal sex among themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Good in Bed Guide to Anal Pleasuring |publisher=Good in Bed Guides|first=Debby |last=Herbenick |isbn=978-0-9843221-6-9 |pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, [[Celibacy|celibate]] members of the Christian clergy were accused of engaging in &quot;[[Crime against nature|sins against nature]],&quot; including anal sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aldrich, Wotherspoo&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title =Who's Who in Gay and Lesbian History Vol.1: From Antiquity to the Mid-Twentieth Century|authors=Robert Aldrich, Garry Wotherspoo|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2002|page=116|isbn=020398675X|accessdate=December 22, 2013|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QweE7SzJH2UC&amp;pg=PA116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[buggery]]'' originated in [[medieval]] Europe as an insult used to describe the rumored same-sex sexual practices of the heretics from a sect originating in [[Bulgaria]], where its followers were called ''[[bogomilism|bogomils]]'';&lt;ref name=&quot;McKean&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |title= [[New Oxford American Dictionary]], 2nd edition |year= 2005 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= 0-19-517077-6 |editor=Erin McKean}}&lt;/ref&gt; when they spread out of the country, they were called ''buggres'' (from the [[ethnonym]] ''Bulgars'').&lt;ref name=&quot;McKean&quot;/&gt; Another term for the practice, more archaic, is ''pedicate'' from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''pedicare'', with the same meaning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pollini&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pollini|first=John|title =The Warren Cup: Homoerotic Love and Symposial Rhetoric in Silver | journal = [[BJUI]] | volume = 81 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–52 |date=March 1999 | pmid = 16536770| doi = 10.1111/j.1464-410X.2005.05961.x|quote=&quot;I have derived the word pedicate from the Latin paedicare or pedicare, meaning &quot;to penetrate anally.&quot; Note 6.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judaism====
The [[Mishneh Torah]], a text considered authoritative by [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] sects,&lt;ref&gt;Isidore Twersky, ''Introduction to the Code of Maimonides (Mishneh Torah)'', Yale Judaica Series, vol. XII (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1980). passim, and especially Chapter VII, &quot;Epilogue&quot;, pp. 515–538.&lt;/ref&gt; states &quot;since a man’s wife is permitted to him, he may act with her in any manner whatsoever. He may have intercourse with her whenever he so desires and kiss any organ of her body he wishes, and he may have intercourse with her naturally or unnaturally [traditionally, ''unnaturally'' refers to anal and oral sex], provided that he does not expend semen to no purpose. Nevertheless, it is an attribute of piety that a man should not act in this matter with levity and that he should sanctify himself at the time of intercourse.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mishneh Torah |first=Moshe |last=Maimonides |page=Laws Concerning Forbidden Relations 21:9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Christianity====
{{See also|Sodomy#Christianity}}
Christian texts may sometimes [[Euphemism|euphemistically]] refer to anal sex as the ''peccatum contra naturam'' (the sin against nature, after [[Thomas Aquinas]]) or ''Sodomitica luxuria'' (sodomitical lusts, in one of [[Charlemagne|Charlemagne's]] ordinances), or ''peccatum illud horribile, inter christianos non-nominandum'' (that horrible sin that among Christians is not to be named).&lt;ref name=&quot;Classen&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title =Sexuality in the Middle Ages and the Early Modern Times: New Approaches to a Fundamental Cultural-historical and Literary-anthropological Theme|author=Albrecht Classen|publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter]]|year=2010|page=13|isbn=3110205742|accessdate=September 15, 2014|url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=BpcWVJnYCIq7ogTCtIGABw&amp;id=dX0LAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fone&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title =Homophobia: A History|author=Byrne Fone|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]|year=2001|page=133|isbn=1466817070|accessdate=September 15, 2014|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=xB-z1WUCKOEC&amp;pg=PA133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Crompton&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Louis Crompton|title =Homosexuality and Civilization|publisher=[[Harvard University Press]]|year=2009|page=529|isbn=0674030060|accessdate=September 15, 2014|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TfBYd9xVaXcC&amp;pg=PA529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====
{{Main|Islamic views on anal sex}}

''Liwat'', or the sin of [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]]'s people, which refers to same-sex sexual activity, is commonly officially prohibited by Islamic sects; there are parts of the [[Quran]] which talk about smiting on [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], and this is thought to be a reference to unnatural sex, and so there are [[hadith]] and Islamic laws which prohibit it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leach&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark M Leach|title =Cultural Diversity and Suicide: Ethnic, Religious, Gender, and Sexual Orientation Perspectives|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2014|page=121|isbn=1317786599|accessdate=September 15, 2014|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NqLrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA121}}&lt;/ref&gt; While, concerning Islamic belief, it is objectionable to use the words ''al-Liwat'' and ''luti'' to refer to homosexuality because it is [[blasphemy]] toward the prophet of [[Allah]], and therefore the terms ''sodomy'' and ''homosexuality'' are preferred,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bambale&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Yahaya Yunusa Bambale|title =Crimes and Punishments Under Islamic Law|publisher=Malthouse Press Limited|year=2003; 2008|page=40|isbn=9780231595|accessdate=September 15, 2014|url=http://books.google.com/books?ei=0Z0WVMSeK8ngoAT2tIH4Bg&amp;id=PVGPAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; same-sex male practitioners of anal sex are called ''luti'' or ''lutiyin'' in plural and are seen as criminals in the same way that a thief is a criminal, meaning that they are giving in to a universal temptation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bambale&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Conner&quot;&gt;{{cite book|authors=Randy P.

====Buddhism====
{{Further|Buddhism and sexuality|Buddhism and sexual orientation}}

The most common formulation of Buddhist ethics is [[the Five Precepts]].  These precepts take the form of voluntary, personal undertakings, not divine mandate or instruction. The third of the Precepts is &quot;To refrain from committing [[sexual misconduct]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=HIGG&gt;{{cite web| last =Higgins| first =Winton| title =Buddhist Sexual Ethics| publisher =BuddhaNet Magazine

Therefore the interpretation of what kinds of sexual activity are acceptable for a [[layperson|layman]] is not a religious matter as far as Buddhism is concerned.&lt;ref&gt;GLBT in World Religions, Sermon by Rev.

====Hinduism====
{{See also|History of sex in India|LGBT topics and Hinduism}}

Although Hindu society does not formally acknowledge sexuality between men, it formally acknowledges and gives space to sexuality between men and [[third gender]]s as a variation of male-female sex (meaning a part of heterosexuality, rather than homosexuality, if analyzed in Western terms). Hijras, Alis, Kotis, etc.— the various forms of third gender that exist in India today— are all characterized by the gender role of having receptive anal and oral sex with men. However, sexuality between men (as distinct from third genders) has thrived, mostly unspoken and informally, without being seen as different in the way it is seen in the West; young men involved in &quot;such relationships do not consider themselves to be 'homosexual' but conceive their behavior in terms of sexual desire, opportunity and pleasure&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0277953600001672 The social construction of male 'homosexuality' in India], by S Asthana and R. Oostvogels, published in 'Social Science &amp; Medicine', vol 52(2001), Quote: &quot;Indian culture is highly homosocial and displays of affection, body contact and the sharing of beds between men is socially acceptable (Kahn, 1994) This creates opportunities for sexual contact, though sexual behavior in this context is rarely seen as real sex, but as play. Much of this same-sex sexual activity begins in adolescence between school friends and within family environments and is non-penetrative... Young men who cultivate such relationships do not consider themselves to be 'homosexual' but conceive their behavior in terms of sexual desire, opportunity and pleasure.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
