'''Arnulf of Carinthia''' (850 – 8 December 899) was the [[Carolingian]] [[King of Germany|King of East Francia]]&lt;ref&gt;East Francia had been split from the rest of [[Frankish Realm]] by the [[Treaty of Verdun]] in 843. It evolved into [[Germany]] after the Carolingian eclipse.&lt;/ref&gt; from 887, the disputed [[King of Italy]] from 894 and the disputed [[Holy Roman Emperor]] from 22 February 896 until his death at [[Regensburg]], [[Bavaria]].

==Career==

===Birth and Illegitimacy===
Arnulf was the son of [[Carloman, King of Bavaria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 222&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 222&lt;/ref&gt; and his wife Liutswind,&lt;ref&gt;Also Litwinde or Litwindie&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps of [[Carantanians|Carantanian]] origin, and possibly the sister of Ernst, Count of the Bavarian [[Nordgau (Bavaria)|Nordgau Margraviate]] in the area of the [[Upper Palatinate]], or perhaps the burgrave of [[Passau]], as some sources say. After Arnulf's birth, Carloman married, before 861, a daughter of that same Count Ernst, who died after 8 August 879. As it is mainly West-Franconian historiography&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mittelalter-genealogie.de/mittelalter/koenige/frankenreich/karlmann_ostfraenkischer_koenig_880.html Konecny Silvia: ''Die Frauen des karolingischen Königshauses. Die politische Bedeutung der Ehe und die Stellung der Frau in der fränkischen Herrscherfamilie vom 7. bis zum 10. Jahrhundert.'' PhD thesis Vienna 1976, p. 139]&lt;/ref&gt; that speaks of Arnulf's illegitimacy,  it is quite feasible that the two females are one and the same person and that Carloman later on actually married Liutswind, thus legitimizing his son.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mittelalter-genealogie.de/karolinger_ostfraenkische_linie/luitswinda_mutter_kaiser_arnulfs_891.html Mediaeval Genealogy: Liutswind:] Various theories about her descent and her relation to Carloman (in German)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Years===
Arnulf was granted the [[Duchy of Carinthia]], a Frankish vassal state and successor of the ancient [[Carantania|Principality of Carantania]], by his father [[Carloman of Bavaria|Carloman]], after Carloman had become reconciled with his own father [[Louis the German]] and was created [[King of Bavaria]]. Arnulf spent his childhood on the ''Mosaburch'' or Mosapurc, which is widely believed to be [[Moosburg, Austria|Moosburg]] in Carinthia, only a few miles away from one of the Imperial residences, the Carolingian [[Kaiserpfalz]]  at [[Zollfeld|Karnburg]], which before as ''Krnski grad'' had been the residence of the Carantanian princes. Arnulf kept his seat here and from later events it may be inferred that the Carantanians, from an early time, treated him as their own Duke. Later, after he had been crowned King of East Francia, Arnulf turned his old territory of Carinthia into the [[March of Carinthia]], a part of the [[Duchy of Bavaria]].

After Carloman was incapacitated by a stroke in 879, [[Louis the Younger]] inherited Bavaria, [[Charles the Fat]] was given the [[Kingdom of Italy (Medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]] and Arnulf was confirmed in Carinthia by an agreement with Carloman. Bavaria, however, was ruled more or less by Arnulf.&lt;ref&gt;Reuter, Timothy (trans.) The Annals of Fulda. (Manchester Medieval series, Ninth-Century Histories, Volume II.) Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1992. 882 (p. 104 and n3)&lt;/ref&gt; Arnulf had in fact ruled Bavaria during the summer and autumn of 879 while his father arranged his succession and he himself was granted &quot;Pannonia,&quot; in the words of the ''[[Annales Fuldenses]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Reuter, Timothy (trans.) The Annals of Fulda. (Manchester Medieval series, Ninth-Century Histories, Volume II.) Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1992. 884 (pp 108–111)&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;Carantanum,&quot; in the words of [[Regino of Prüm]].&lt;ref&gt;MacLean, Simon. Kingship and Politics in the Late Ninth Century: Charles the Fat and the end of the Carolingian Empire. Cambridge University Press: 2003. pg. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The division of the realm was confirmed in 880 on Carloman’s death.

When, in 882, [[Engelschalk II]] rebelled against the [[March of Pannonia|Margrave of Pannonia]], [[Aribo of Austria|Aribo]], and ignited the so-called [[Wilhelminer War]], Arnulf supported him and even accepted his and his brother's homage. This ruined Arnulf's relationship with his uncle the Emperor and put him at war with [[Svatopluk of Moravia]]. [[Pannonia]] was invaded, but Arnulf refused to give up the young Wilhelminers. Arnulf did not make peace with Svatopluk until late 885, by which time the Moravian was a man of the emperor. Some scholars see this war as destroying Arnulf's hopes at succeeding Charles.

===King of East Francia===
Arnulf took the leading role in the deposition of his uncle, the [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Charles the Fat]]. With the support of the nobles, Arnulf held a [[diet (assembly)|Diet]] at [[Trebur|Tribur]] and deposed Charles in November 887, under threat of military action.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg. 78&quot;&gt;Comyn, pg. 78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann III, pg. 376&quot;&gt;Mann III, pg. 376&lt;/ref&gt;  Charles peacefully went into his involuntary retirement, but not without first chastising his nephew for his treachery and asking only for a few royal villas in [[Swabia]], which Arnulf mercifully granted him,&lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; on which to live out his final months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 222&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 222&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnulf, having distinguished himself in the war against the [[Slavs]] was elected by the nobles of the realm (only the eastern realm, though Charles had ruled the whole of the Frankish lands) and assumed his title of [[List of Frankish Kings|King of East Francia]].&lt;ref&gt;Comyn, pg. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnulf took advantage of the problems in [[West Francia]] upon the death of Charles The Fat to secure the territory of [[Lotharingia|Lorraine]], which he converted into a kingdom for his son, [[Zwentibold]].&lt;ref&gt;Comyn, pg. 82&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, in 889, Arnulf supported the claim of [[Louis the Blind]] to the kingdom of [[Provence]], after receiving a personal appeal from Louis’ mother, [[Ermengard of Provence|Ermengard]], who came to see Arnulf at [[Forchheim]] in May 889.&lt;ref&gt;Mann III, pg. 382&lt;/ref&gt;  Recognising the superiority of Arnulf’s position, in 888 [[Odo of France]] formally admitted the suzerainty of Arnulf.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bryce, pg. xxxv&quot;&gt;Bryce, pg. xxxv&lt;/ref&gt;  In 893, Arnulf switched his support from Odo to [[Charles the Simple]] after being persuaded by [[Fulk (Archbishop of Reims)]] that it was in his best interests.&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 55&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnulf then took advantage of the fighting that followed between Odo and Charles in 894, taking territory from West Francia and transferring it to his dominion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 56&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 56&lt;/ref&gt;  At one point, Charles was forced to flee to Arnulf and ask for his protection.&lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg. 25&lt;/ref&gt;  His intervention forced [[Pope Formosus]] to get involved, as he was worried that a divided and war weary West Francia would be easy prey for the Normans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 56&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

In 895, Arnulf summoned both Charles and Odo to his presence at [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]. Charles’s advisers convinced him not to go, and he sent a representative in his place. Odo, on the other hand, personally attended, together with a large retinue, bearing many gifts for Arnulf.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 26&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 26&lt;/ref&gt;  Angered by the non-appearance of Charles, he welcomed Odo at the Diet of Worms in May 895, and again supported Odo's claim to the West Francian throne.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 26&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 26&lt;/ref&gt;  In this same assembly, he bestowed upon his illegitimate son [[Zwentibold]], a crown as the King of Lotharingia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 26&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnulf was not a negotiator, but a fighter. In 890 he was successfully battling the Slavs in Pannonia.&lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg. 16&lt;/ref&gt; In 891, the Danes invaded [[Lotharingia]],&lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt; and crushed an East Frankish army at [[Maastricht]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 20&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  At the decisive [[Battle of Leuven]] in September 891 in [[Lotharingia|Lorraine]], he repelled an invasion by the [[Normans]] (Northmen or [[Vikings]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 20&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 20&lt;/ref&gt; essentially ending their invasions on that front.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 222&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 222&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Annales Fuldenses]]'' report that the bodies of dead Northmen blocked the run of the river. After his victory, Arnulf built a new [[castle]] on an island in the [[Dijle]] river (Dutch: Dijle, English and French: Dyle).&lt;ref&gt;[[Latin]] ''Luvanium'', local ''Lovon''.&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 880, Arnulf had designs on [[Great Moravia]], and had the Frankish bishop [[Wiching]] of [[Nitra]] interfere with the missionary activities of [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Methodius]], with the aim of preventing any potential for creating a unified Moravian nation.&lt;ref&gt;Mann III, pg. 243&lt;/ref&gt;  In 893 or 894, Great Moravia probably lost a part of its territory — present-day Western [[Hungary]] — to him.  As a reward, Wiching became Arnulf’s [[chancellor]] in 892.&lt;ref&gt;Mann, III, pg. 244&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnulf, however, failed to conquer the whole of Great Moravia when he attempted it in 892, 893, and 899. Yet Arnulf did achieve some successes, in particular in 895, when [[Bohemia]] broke away from Great Moravia and became his vassal. An accord was made between him and the [[Duke of Bohemia|Bohemian Duke]] [[Borivoj I of Bohemia|Borivoj I]] (reigned 870-95); Bohemia was thus freed from the dangers of invasion. However, in his attempts to conquer Moravia, in 899 Arnulf invited across the [[Magyars]] who had settled in [[Pannonia]], and with their help he imposed a measure of control on Moravia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg. 83&quot;&gt;Comyn, pg. 83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt;  While Arnulf remained alive, the Magyars refrained from any overt acts of pillage, but with Arnulf’s death, they proceeded to invade [[Italy]] in 900.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comyn, pg. 83&quot;&gt;Comyn, pg. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all early Germanic rulers, he was heavily involved in [[ecclesiastical]] disputes; in 895, at the Diet of Tribur, he presided over a dispute between the [[Episcopal see]]s of [[Bremen]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Cologne]] over jurisdictional authority, which saw [[Hamburg-Bremen|Bremen and Hamburg]] remain a combined see, independent of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cologne|see of Cologne]].&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

===King of Italy and Holy Roman Emperor===
In Italy, the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] was being fought over between [[Guy III of Spoleto]] and [[Berengar of Friuli]]. Berengar had been crowned king in 887, but Guy was in his turn crowned in 889. While [[Pope Stephen V]] supported Guy, crowning him [[Holy Roman Emperor|Roman Emperor]] in 891, Arnulf threw his support behind Berengar.&lt;ref&gt;Mann III, pg. 378&lt;/ref&gt;

In 893, a new pope, [[Pope Formosus|Formosus]], not trusting the newly crowned co-emperors [[Guy III of Spoleto|Guy]] and [[Lambert II of Spoleto|Lambert]], sent an embassy to Omuntesberch, where Arnulf was holding a Diet with Svatopluk,&lt;ref&gt;Mann III, pg. 379&lt;/ref&gt; to request Arnulf come and liberate [[Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 50&lt;/ref&gt; where he would be crowned in [[Rome]]. Arnulf met the ''Primores'' of the Kingdom of Italy, dismissed them with gifts and promised to enter Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 51&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 51&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnulf sent his son [[Zwentibold]] with a Bavarian army to join [[Berengar of Friuli]]. They defeated Guy, but were bought off and left in autumn. Arnulf then personally led an army across the [[Alps]] early in 894. In January 894 [[Bergamo]] fell, and Count Ambrose, Guy’s representative in the city, was hung from a tree by the city’s gate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 22&quot;/&gt;

Conquering all of the territory north of the [[Po River|Po]], he forced the surrender of [[Milan]] and then drove Guy out of [[Pavia]], where he was crowned [[King of Italy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Bryce, pg. xxxv&quot;/&gt; but went no further before Guy died suddenly in late autumn, and fever incapacitated his troops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 51&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 51&lt;/ref&gt; His march northward through the [[Alps]] was interrupted by Rudolph, King of Transjurane Burgundy, and it was only with great difficulty that Arnulf crossed the mountain range.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 22&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt;  In retaliation, Arnulf ordered his illegitimate son [[Zwentibold]] to ravage [[Kingdom of Burgundy|Burgundy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 22&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 22&lt;/ref&gt;  In the meantime, Lambert and his mother [[Ageltrude]] travelled to Rome to receive papal confirmation of his imperial succession, but Formosus, still desiring to crown Arnulf, was imprisoned in [[Castel Sant'Angelo]].

In September 895, a new embassy arrived in [[Regensburg]] beseeching Arnulf's aid. In October, Arnulf undertook his second campaign into Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 51&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 51&lt;/ref&gt;  He crossed the Alps quickly and took [[Pavia]], but then he continued slowly, garnering support among the nobility of [[Tuscany]]. First [[Maginulf, Count of Milan]], and then [[Walfred, Count of Pavia]], joined him. Eventually even the [[Adalbert II of Tuscany|Margrave Adalbert II]] abandoned Lambert. Finding Rome locked against him and held by Ageltrude,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 51&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 51&lt;/ref&gt; he had to take the city by force on 21 February 896, freeing the pope.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 52&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 52&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnulf was greeted at the [[Ponte Milvio]] by the [[Roman Senate]] who escorted him into the [[Leonine City]], where he was received by Pope Formosus on the steps of the [[Church of the Holy Apostles|Santi Apostoli]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 52&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 February 896, Formosus led the king into the church, anointed and crowned him, and saluted him as ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Annals of Fulda'', an. 896&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnulf then proceeded to the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]], where he received the homage of the Roman people,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 52&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 52&lt;/ref&gt; who swore “never to hand over the city to Lambert or his mother Ageltrude”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 53&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 53&lt;/ref&gt;  Arnulf then proceeded to exile to Bavaria two leading senators, Constantine and Stephen, who had helped Ageltrude seize the city.&lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg. 28&lt;/ref&gt;  Leaving one of his vassals, Farold, to hold Rome, Arnulf marched on [[Spoleto]], where Ageltrude had fled to join Lambert.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 53&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 53&lt;/ref&gt;  On his way down, Arnulf suffered a stroke, forcing him to call off his campaign and return to Bavaria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canduci, pg. 222&quot;&gt;Canduci, pg. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnulf only retained power in Italy as long as he was personally there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bryce, pg. 79&quot;&gt;Bryce, pg. 79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 80&lt;/ref&gt;  On his way north, he stopped at [[Pavia]] where he crowned his illegitimate son [[Ratold of Italy|Ratold]], sub-[[King of Italy]], after which he left Ratold in [[Milan]] in an attempt to preserve his hold on Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 30&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt;  That same year, Formosus died, leaving Lambert once again in power, and both he and Berengar killed any officials who had been put in place by Arnulf, as Ratold also fled from Milan to Bavaria.&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 81&lt;/ref&gt;  Rumours of the time made Arnulf's condition to be a result of poisoning at the hand of Ageltrude.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mann IV, pg. 53&quot;&gt;Mann IV, pg. 53&lt;/ref&gt;  On his return to Germany, he exercised very little further control in Italy for the rest of his life, although his agents in Rome did not prevent the accession of [[Pope Stephen VI]] in 896.&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Although he eventually became a supporter of the claims of Lambert, he initially gave his support to Arnulf.&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 84 – Silver coins from the pontificate of Stephen VI show the transition from Arnulf (“Arnolfvs Imp. Roma”) to Lambert (“Lamverto Imp. Roma”)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final Years===
With his return to Germany in 896, Arnulf found that his physical ill health - he suffered from ([[Phthiriasis|morbus pediculosis]] – infestation of lice under the eyelid) - meant he was unable to deal with the problems besetting his reign. Italy was lost,&lt;ref name=&quot;Duckett, pg. 30&quot;&gt;Duckett, pg. 30&lt;/ref&gt; raiders from Moravia and [[Hungary]] were continually raiding his lands, and Lotharingia was in revolt against Zwentibold.&lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  He was also plagued by escalating violence and power struggles between the lower German nobility.&lt;ref&gt;Duckett, pg. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 December 899 Arnulf of Carinthia died at Ratisbon&lt;ref name=&quot;Useful Knowledge page 623&quot;/&gt; (today known as [[Regensburg]]), [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]].

On Arnulf's death, he was succeeded as a king of the East Franks by his son by his wife [[Ota, wife of Arnulf of Carinthia|Ota]] (died 903), [[Louis the Child]].&lt;ref&gt;Mann IV, pg. 100&lt;/ref&gt; When his only legitimate son, Louis the Child, died in 911 at age 17 or 18, the eastern (German) branch of the house of [[Charlemagne]] ceased to exist. Arnulf had the nobility also recognize the rights of his illegitimate sons [[Zwentibold]] and [[Ratold]] as his successors. Zwentibold, whom he had made [[King of Lotharingia]] in 895, continued to rule there until the next year (900).

Arnulf is entombed in [[St. Emmeram's Abbey|St. Emmeram's Basilica]] at [[Regensburg]], which is now known as Schloss Thurn und Taxis, the palace of the Princes of [[Thurn und Taxis]].
