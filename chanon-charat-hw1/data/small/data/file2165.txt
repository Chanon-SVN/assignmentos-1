'''Bill Gates''' (born '''William Henry Gates III''' October 28, 1955) is an American [[business magnate]], [[philanthropist]], [[investor]], [[computer programmer]], and [[inventor]].{{Sfn |Manes|1994| p =11}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Gates (American computer programmer, businessman, and philanthropist)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/226865/Bill-Gates|accessdate=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honoring the Inventor: Bill Gates' Patents|url=http://honoringtheinventor.blogspot.com.au/2008/12/bill-gates-patents.html|accessdate=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gates originally established his reputation as the co-founder of [[Microsoft]], the world’s largest [[personal computer|PC]] [[software]] company, with [[Paul Allen]]. Since then he has served as a long term CEO and chairman of the company.

Today he is consistently ranked in the [[Forbes list of billionaires|Forbes list of the world's wealthiest people]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssTechMediaTelecomNews/idUSN1748882920080917 |title= Bill Gates tops US wealth list 15 years in a row |first= Phil | last= Wahba | date = September 17, 2008 |accessdate= November 6, 2008 |agency= Reuters  |archiveurl = http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssTechMediaTelecomNews/idUSN1748882920080917 |archivedate = September 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the wealthiest overall from 1995 to 2014&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;excluding a few brief periods post-2008.&lt;ref name = &quot;Forbes profile&quot;&gt;{{Citation | type = profile |  url = http://www.forbes.com/profile/bill-gates/ | title = William ‘Bill’ Gates | journal = Forbes | accessdate = December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2009 and 2014 his wealth more than doubled from $40 billion to more than $82 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The World's Billionaires|work=Forbes|url=http://www.forbes.com/billionaires/|accessdate=November 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2013 and 2014 his wealth increased by $15 billion, or around $1.5 billion more than the entire GDP of [[Iceland]] in 2014.&lt;ref name = imf2&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2014/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=57&amp;pr.y=8&amp;sy=2012&amp;ey=2019&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=176&amp;s=NGDP_R%2CNGDP_RPCH%2CNGDP%2CNGDPD%2CNGDP_D%2CNGDPRPC%2CNGDPPC%2CNGDPDPC%2CPPPGDP%2CPPPPC%2CPPPSH%2CPPPEX%2CNID_NGDP%2CNGSD_NGDP%2CPCPI%2CPCPIPCH%2CPCPIE%2CPCPIEPCH%2CTM_RPCH%2CTMG_RPCH%2CTX_RPCH%2CTXG_RPCH%2CLUR%2CLE%2CLP%2CGGR%2CGGR_NGDP%2CGGX%2CGGX_NGDP%2CGGXCNL%2CGGXCNL_NGDP%2CGGSB%2CGGSB_NPGDP%2CGGXONLB%2CGGXONLB_NGDP%2CGGXWDN%2CGGXWDN_NGDP%2CGGXWDG%2CGGXWDG_NGDP%2CNGDP_FY%2CBCA%2CBCA_NGDPD&amp;grp=0&amp;a=|title = Iceland|publisher = International Monetary Fund|accessdate = October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates is one of the best-known entrepreneurs of the [[personal computer revolution]].  Gates has been [[Criticism of Microsoft|criticized for his business tactics]], which have been considered anti-competitive, an opinion which has in some cases been upheld by judicial courts.{{Sfn |Manes|1994|p=459}}{{Sfn |Lesinski|2006|p = 96}}  In the later stages of his career, Gates has pursued a number of philanthropic endeavors, donating large amounts of money to various charitable organizations and scientific research programs through the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]], established in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/ | title = Gates foundation | archiveurl = http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/ | archivedate = May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates stepped down as chief executive officer of Microsoft in January 2000. He remained as chairman and created the position of chief software architect for himself. In June 2006, Gates announced that he would be transitioning from full-time work at Microsoft to part-time work, and full-time work at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. He gradually transferred his duties to [[Ray Ozzie]] (who has since left Microsoft), chief software architect, and [[Craig Mundie]], chief research and strategy officer. Gates's last full-time day at Microsoft was June 27, 2008. He stepped down as chairman of Microsoft in February 2014, taking on a new post as technology advisor to support newly appointed CEO [[Satya Nadella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25973762|title=Microsoft names Satya Nadella to replace Steve Ballmer|date=February 4, 2014|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Gates was born in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], in an upper-middle-class family, the son of [[William H. Gates, Sr.]] and [[Mary Maxwell Gates]].  His ancestral origin includes [[English people|English]], [[Germans|German]], and [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wargs.com/other/gates.html |title=Ancestry of Bill Gates |publisher=Wargs |accessdate=June 9, 2010 |archiveurl = http://www.wargs.com/other/gates.html | archivedate= September 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Scottish Americans | publisher= Alba West | url = http://www.albawest.com/scottish-americans.html | accessdate =April 29, 2009 |archiveurl= http://www.albawest.com/scottish-americans.html | archivedate = July 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for [[First Interstate BancSystem]] and the [[United Way of America|United Way]]. Gates's maternal grandfather was JW Maxwell, a [[National bank#United States|national bank]] president. Gates has one elder sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and one younger sister, Libby. He was the fourth of his name in his family, but was known as William Gates III or &quot;Trey&quot; because his father had the &quot;II&quot; suffix.{{Sfn |Manes | 1994 |p= 15}}  Early on in his life, Gates's parents had a law career in mind for him.{{Sfn |Manes|1994|p = 47}}  When Gates was young, his family regularly attended a Protestant [[Congregational Christian Churches|Congregational]] church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Congregational 1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Bill Gates: Entrepreneur and Philanthropist | url = http://books.google.com/?id=ubYgIB0TgUYC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=Bill+Gates+Congregationalist#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |quote = The Gates family regularly went to services at the University Congregational Church.| first =Jeanne M | last = Lesinski |publisher=Twenty First Century Books | accessdate =March 10, 2011|isbn= 978-1-58013-570-2|date = September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Congregational 2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Bill Gates Speaks: Insight from the World's Greatest Entrepreneur|url = http://books.google.com/?id=LUwu-DTwa5cC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Congregationalist++bill+gates#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |quote = The Gates family attended the University Congregational Church, where the Reverend Dale Turner was pastor. | first = Janet | last = Lowe| publisher = Wiley | accessdate=March 10, 2011|isbn= 978-0-471-40169-8|date = January 5, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Congregational 3&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title = Something Happened: A Political and Cultural Overview of the Seventies | url =http://books.google.com/?id=tsl3EVBtdxcC&amp;pg=PA228&amp;dq=Congregationalist++bill+gates#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=Bill Gates was a member of the baby boom, born in 1955 into an upper-middle-class family near Seattle.&quot;  He attended the Congregational Church, participated in the Boy Scouts, and went to a fancy private school. | author-link = Edward D.

At 13, he enrolled in the [[Lakeside School]], an exclusive preparatory school.{{Sfn | Manes| 1994| p = 24}}  When he was in the eighth grade, the Mothers Club at the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's [[rummage sale]] to buy a [[Teletype Model 33]] ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a [[General Electric]] (GE) computer for the school's students.{{Sfn |Manes|1994|p= 27}}  Gates took an interest in programming the GE system in [[BASIC programming language|BASIC]], and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: an implementation of [[tic-tac-toe]] that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he said, &quot;There was just something neat about the machine.&quot;{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 12}}  After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought time on systems including [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Programmed Data Processor|PDP]] minicomputers. One of these systems was a [[PDP-10]] belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which banned four Lakeside students—Gates, [[Paul Allen]], [[Ric Weiland]], and Kent Evans—for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in the [[operating system]] to obtain free computer time.{{Sfn | Manes | 1994|p = 34}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2044825/paul-allen-spills-beans-gates-criminal-past | title = V3 | title = Paul Allen spills the beans on Gates’ criminal past | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the ban, the four students offered to find bugs in CCC's software in exchange for computer time. Rather than use the system via Teletype, Gates went to CCC's offices and studied [[source code]] for various programs that ran on the system, including programs in [[Fortran]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], and [[machine language]]. The arrangement with CCC continued until 1970, when the company went out of business. The following year, Information Sciences, Inc. hired the four Lakeside students to write a payroll program in [[Cobol]], providing them computer time and royalties. After his administrators became aware of his programming abilities, Gates wrote the school's computer program to schedule students in classes. He modified the code so that he was placed in classes with &quot;a disproportionate number of interesting girls.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.gatesfoundation.org/media-center/speeches/2005/09/bill-gates-lakeside-school | title = Remarks by Bill Gates, co-chair | accessdate = July 13, 2013 | work = Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation -  Press Room, Speeches}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later stated that &quot;it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success.&quot;{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 12}}  At age 17, Gates formed a venture with Allen, called [[Traf-O-Data]], to make [[traffic counter]]s based on the [[Intel 8008]] processor.{{Sfn |Gates|1996| p= 14}}  In early 1973, Bill Gates served as a congressional page in the U.S. House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ushpaa.org/history.php | title = Congressional Page History | publisher = The United States House Page Association of America | quote = The Page Program has produced many politicians, Members of Congress, as well as other famous men and women.

Gates graduated from Lakeside School in 1973 and was a [[National Merit Scholarship Program|National Merit Scholar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalmerit.org/scholars_you_may_know.php National Merit Scholars You May Know]&lt;/ref&gt; He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the [[SAT]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://theweekmagazine.com/article.aspx?id=803 | title=The new—and improved?—SAT | accessdate =May 23, 2006 | work =The Week Magazine|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060510205250/http://theweekmagazine.com/article.aspx?id=803 | archivedate = May 10, 2006| deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enrolled at [[Harvard College]] in the autumn of 1973.{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 15}}  While at Harvard, he met [[Steve Ballmer]], who would later succeed Gates as CEO of Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TO5LIILHmcYC&amp;pg=RA1-PA263&amp;dq=gates+ballmer+first+met|title=Strategic Management: Concepts and Cases: Competitiveness and Globalization|author=Michael Hitt, R.

[[File:Poker Room.jpg|thumb|The Poker Room in [[Currier House (Harvard College)|Currier House]] at [[Harvard University]], where Gates and Allen formed Microsoft]]
In his sophomore year, Gates devised an [[algorithm]] for [[pancake sorting]] as a solution to one of a series of unsolved problems&lt;ref name=&quot;Kestenbaum2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92236781 | title = Before Microsoft, Gates Solved A Pancake Problem| last = Kestenbaum | first =  David | date= July 4, 2008| publisher= [[National Public Radio]] |archiveurl = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92236781 |archivedate=September 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented in a [[combinatorics]] class by [[Harry R.

Gates did not have a definite study plan while a student at Harvard{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 19}} and spent a lot of time using the school's computers. Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen, and he joined him at [[Honeywell]] during the summer of 1974.{{Sfn |Wallace| 1993| p = 59}}  The following year saw the release of the [[MITS Altair 8800]] based on the [[Intel 8080|Intel 8080 CPU]], and Gates and Allen saw this as the opportunity to start their own computer software company.{{Sfn |Gates|1996| p= 18}}  Gates dropped out of Harvard at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nndb.com/people/435/000022369/ |title= Bill Gates | publisher = NNDb |accessdate= August 24, 2012 | archiveurl = http://www.nndb.com/people/435/000022369/ |archivedate=May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had talked this decision over with his parents, who were supportive of him after seeing how much Gates wanted to start a company.{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 19}}

===BASIC===
[[File:Altair 8800 Computer.jpg|thumb|left|MITS Altair 8800 Computer with {{Convert |8|in|mm|adj=on}} floppy disk system]]
After reading the January 1975 issue of ''[[Popular Electronics]]'' that demonstrated the [[Altair 8800]], Gates contacted [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems]] (MITS), the creators of the new microcomputer, to inform them that he and others were working on a [[BASIC]] interpreter for the platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyevents&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=Microsoft Visitor Center Student Information: Key Events in Microsoft History | url = http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/3/0/130dd86a-a196-4700-b577-521c4cf5cec1/key_events_in_microsoft_history.doc |publisher=Microsoft | format=.DOC |accessdate=February 18, 2008 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080226224212/http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/3/0/130dd86a-a196-4700-b577-521c4cf5cec1/key_events_in_microsoft_history.doc | archivedate= February 26, 2008 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president [[Ed Roberts (computers)|Ed Roberts]] agreed to meet them for a demo, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair [[emulator]] that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration, held at MITS's offices in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]], was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as [[Altair BASIC]]. Paul Allen was hired into MITS,&lt;ref name=&quot;thocp1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= Microsoft history|publisher= The History of Computing Project | url=http://www.thocp.net/companies/microsoft/microsoft_company.htm | accessdate= March 31, 2008 | archiveurl = http://www.thocp.net/companies/microsoft/microsoft_company.htm |archivedate=May 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with Allen at MITS in Albuquerque in November 1975. They named their partnership &quot;Micro-Soft&quot; and had their first office located in Albuquerque.&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt; Within a year, the hyphen was dropped, and on November 26, 1976, the trade name &quot;Microsoft&quot; was registered with the Office of the Secretary of the [[New Mexico|State of New Mexico]].&lt;ref name=thocp1/&gt; Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.

Microsoft's BASIC was popular with computer hobbyists, but Gates discovered that a pre-market copy had leaked into the community and was being widely copied and distributed. In February 1976, Gates wrote an [[Open Letter to Hobbyists]] in the MITS newsletter saying that MITS could not continue to produce, distribute, and maintain high-quality software without payment.{{Sfn |Manes|1994|p=81}}  This letter was unpopular with many computer hobbyists, but Gates persisted in his belief that software developers should be able to demand payment. Microsoft became independent of MITS in late 1976, and it continued to develop programming language software for various systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;thocp1&quot; /&gt; The company moved from Albuquerque to its new home in [[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]], Washington on January 1, 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyevents&quot; /&gt;

During Microsoft's early years, all employees had broad responsibility for the company's business.  Gates oversaw the business details, but continued to write code as well. In the first five years, Gates personally reviewed every line of code the company shipped, and often rewrote parts of it as he saw fit.&lt;ref name=&quot;waterloo&quot;&gt;{{cite speech|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2005/10-13Waterloo.aspx | last = Gates|first= William ‘Bill’ |title= Remarks | date= October 13, 2005| location= Waterloo, [[Ontario|ON]] | accessdate = March 31, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080406130809/http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2005/10-13Waterloo.aspx | archivedate= April 6, 2008 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IBM partnership===
[[IBM]] approached Microsoft in July 1980 regarding its upcoming personal computer, the [[IBM PC]].{{r |bunnell1982febmar}}  The computer company first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter.  When IBM's representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system, Gates referred them to [[Digital Research]] (DRI), makers of the widely used [[CP/M]] operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/1223/258_print.html |title=Pioneers Die Broke|work=Forbes| last =Maiello | first = John Steele Gordon Michael |date=December 23, 2002|accessdate =March 31, 2008 |archiveurl = http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2002/1223/258_print.html |archivedate = September 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IBM's discussions with Digital Research went poorly, and they did not reach a licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and told him to get an acceptable operating system. A few weeks later, Gates proposed using [[86-DOS]] (QDOS), an operating system similar to CP/M that [[Tim Paterson]] of [[Seattle Computer Products]] (SCP) had made for hardware similar to the PC. Microsoft made a deal with SCP to become the exclusive licensing agent, and later the full owner, of 86-DOS. After adapting the operating system for the PC, Microsoft delivered it to IBM as [[PC DOS]] in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000.{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 54}}

Gates did not offer to transfer the [[copyright]] on the operating system, because he believed that other hardware vendors would clone IBM's system.{{Sfn | Gates | 1996 | p = 54}} They did, and the sales of [[MS-DOS]] made Microsoft a major player in the industry.{{Sfn |Manes|1994|p=193}}  Despite IBM's name on the operating system the press quickly identified Microsoft as being very influential on the new computer, with ''PC Magazine'' asking if Gates were &quot;The Man Behind The Machine?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bunnell1982febmar&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=w_OhaFDePS4C&amp;lpg=RA2-PA18&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=The Man Behind The Machine? | type = interview | work=PC Magazine |date=Feb–Mar 1982 | accessdate = February 17, 2012 | last = Bunnell | first = David | page= 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He oversaw Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates President of Microsoft and the Chairman of the Board.&lt;ref name=&quot;keyevents&quot; /&gt;

===Windows===
Microsoft launched its first retail version of [[Microsoft Windows]] on November 20, 1985, and in August, the company struck a deal with [[IBM]] to develop a separate operating system called [[OS/2]]. Although the two companies successfully developed the first version of the new system, mounting creative differences caused the partnership to deteriorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://groklaw.net/pdf/iowa/www.iowaconsumercase.org/011607/0000/PX00738.pdf |title=Challenges and Strategy |format=PDF |work=Groklaw |accessdate=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Management style===
[[File:Bill Gates - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|Bill Gates in January 2008]]

From Microsoft's founding in 1975 until 2006, Gates had primary responsibility for the company's product strategy. He aggressively broadened the company's range of products, and wherever Microsoft achieved a dominant position he vigorously defended it. He gained a reputation for being distant to others; as early as 1981 an industry executive complained in public that &quot;Gates is notorious for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;freiberger19810831&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rD0EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=%22radio%20shack%22%20%22model%20i%22&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q=%22radio%20shack%22%20%22model%20i%22&amp;f=false | title=Bugs in Radio Shack TRS-80 Model III: How Bad Are They? | accessdate = February 28, 2011 | last =Freiberger | first = Paul | date=August 31, 1981 | publisher=InfoWorld | page = 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another executive recalled that after he showed Gates a game and defeated him 35 of 37 times, when they met again a month later Gates &quot;won or tied every game. He had studied the game until he solved it. That is a competitor.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atari Thorlin Interview 2000&quot;&gt;{{cite interview |title=Fred Thorlin: The Big Boss at Atari Program Exchange |url= http://www.atariarchives.org/APX/thorlininterview.php |publisher= Atari archives |date=April 2000 |last= Thorlin |first= Fred  | interviewer= Kevin Savetz |accessdate = December 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an executive, Gates met regularly with Microsoft's senior managers and program managers. Firsthand accounts of these meetings describe him as verbally combative, berating managers for perceived holes in their business strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term interests at risk.&lt;ref name = &quot;rensin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | first=David|last= Rensin|title= The Bill Gates Interview|year= 1994|journal= Playboy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/steve/churchillclub.mspx | title=Steve Ballmer Speech Transcript&amp;nbsp;— Church Hill Club | first=Steve|last=Ballmer | date=October 9, 1997 |publisher = Microsoft | accessdate= March 31, 2008 | archiveurl= http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/steve/churchillclub.mspx |archivedate= September 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates's role at Microsoft for most of its history was primarily a management and executive role.  However, he was an active software developer in the early years, particularly on the company's [[programming language]] products.  He has not officially been on a development team since working on the [[TRS-80 Model 100]],&lt;ref name=&quot;allison1993&quot;&gt;{{cite interview |last=Gates |first=Bill |subjectlink=Bill Gates |interviewer=David Allison | url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/comphist/gates.htm | title=Bill Gates Interview | program=Transcript of a Video History Interview | work=Computer History Collection | publisher=National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution | accessdate=April 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but wrote code as late as 1989 that shipped in the company's products.&lt;ref name=&quot;pdc97&quot;/&gt; On June 15, 2006, Gates announced that he would transition out of his day-to-day role over the next two years to dedicate more time to philanthropy.

===Antitrust litigation===

[[File:Bill Gates - United States v. Microsoft.jpg|thumb|Gates giving his [[Deposition (law)|deposition]] at Microsoft on August 27, 1998]]

Many decisions that led to [[United States antitrust law|antitrust]] litigation over Microsoft's business practices have had Gates's approval. In the 1998 ''[[United States v. Microsoft]]'' case, Gates gave deposition testimony that several journalists characterized as evasive. He argued with examiner [[David Boies]] over the contextual meaning of words such as, &quot;compete&quot;, &quot;concerned&quot;, and &quot;we&quot;.  The judge and other observers in the court room were seen laughing at various points during the deposition.&lt;ref name=&quot;GatesDepositionJudgeLaugh&quot;&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=April 10, 2013 |url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9811/17/judgelaugh.ms.idg/index.html|title=Gates deposition makes judge laugh in court| first=Elizabeth | last=Wasserman | publisher=CNN|date=November 17, 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''BusinessWeek'' reported:
{{quotation |Early rounds of his deposition show him offering obfuscatory answers and saying 'I don't recall,' so many times that even the presiding judge had to chuckle. Worse, many of the technology chief's denials and pleas of ignorance were directly refuted by prosecutors with snippets of e-mail that Gates both sent and received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate= March 30, 2008|url= http://www.businessweek.com/1998/48/b3606125.htm | title = Microsoft's Teflon Bill|work=BusinessWeek |date=November 30, 1998 |archiveurl = http://www.businessweek.com/1998/48/b3606125.htm |archivedate= May 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gates later said he had simply resisted attempts by Boies to mischaracterize his words and actions. As to his demeanor during the deposition, he said, &quot;Did I fence with Boies? ... I plead guilty. Whatever that penalty is should be levied against me: rudeness to Boies in the first degree.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;truth&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heilemann |first1=John |title=The Truth, The Whole Truth, and Nothing But The Truth |date=November 1, 2000 |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url=http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/8.11/microsoft.html |accessdate=March 31, 2008 |issue=8.11 |archiveurl=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.11/microsoft_pr.html |archivedate= May 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Gates' denials, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed [[monopolization]] and [[tying (commerce)|tying]], and blocking competition, both in violation of the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]].&lt;ref name=&quot;truth&quot; /&gt;

===Appearance in ads===
[[File:Bill Gates mugshot.png|thumb|upright|Gates mugshot of his 1977 arrest in [[New Mexico]]]]
Gates appeared in a series of ads to promote Microsoft in 2008. The first commercial, co-starring [[Jerry Seinfeld]], is a 90-second talk between strangers as Seinfeld walks up on a discount shoe store (Shoe Circus) in a mall and notices Gates buying shoes inside.  The salesman is trying to sell Mr. Gates shoes that are a size too big. As Gates is buying the shoes, he holds up his discount card, which uses a slightly altered version of his own [[mugshot]] of his arrest in [[New Mexico]] in 1977 for a traffic violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/gatesmug1.html |title = Mugshots | publisher = The Smoking Gun | accessdate = June 9, 2010 |archiveurl= http://www.thesmokinggun.com/mugshots/gatesmug1.html | archivedate = September 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As they are walking out of the mall, Seinfeld asks Gates if he has melded his mind to other developers, after getting a &quot;Yes&quot;, he then asks if they are working on a way to make computers edible, again getting a &quot;Yes&quot;. Some say that this is an homage to Seinfeld's own show about &quot;nothing&quot; (''[[Seinfeld]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://grnlight.net/index.php/everything-else-misc/110-microsoft-s-small-screen-of-bore | title = Adblog | publisher = MSNBC |accessdate= May 23, 2014 | date = September 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a second commercial in the series, Gates and Seinfeld are at the home of an average family trying to fit in with normal people.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Post-Microsoft==
Since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft, Gates continues his philanthropy and, among other projects, purchased the video rights to the [[Messenger Lectures]] series called ''[[The Character of Physical Law]]'', given at [[Cornell University]] by [[Richard Feynman]] in 1964 and recorded by the [[BBC]]. The videos are available online to the public at Microsoft's [[Project Tuva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fried |first=Ina |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10286732-56.html |title=CNET Project Tuva |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=July 14, 2009 |accessdate=June 9, 2010 |archiveurl=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10286732-56.html |archivedate=July 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Access-Project-Tuva-for-Free-Courtesy-of-Bill-Gates-116778.shtml |title=Access Project Tuva for Free, Courtesy of Bill Gates |publisher=News.softpedia.com |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=March 29, 2013 |archiveurl=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Access-Project-Tuva-for-Free-Courtesy-of-Bill-Gates-116778.shtml |archivedate=September 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010, Gates was invited to visit and speak at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), where he asked the students to take on the difficult problems of the world in their futures.&lt;ref&gt;Guo, Jeff; McQueen, Rob,

According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Gates was the world's highest-earning billionaire in 2013, as his fortune increased by US$15.8 billion to US$78.5 billion. As of January 2014, most of Gates’s assets are held in Cascade Investment LLC, an entity through which he owns stakes in numerous businesses, including Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts, and Corbis Corp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Billionaires Worth $3.7 Trillion Surge as Gates Wins 2013|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-01-02/billionaires-worth-3-7-trillion-surge-as-gates-wins-2013.html|accessdate=January 3, 2014|newspaper=Bloomberg Businessweek|date=January 2, 2014|author=Matthew G.

In a substantial interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, published in the March 27, 2014 issue, Gates provided his perspective on a range of issues, such as climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the future, Gates stated: &quot;... there'll be some really bad things that'll happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism.&quot; Gates also identified innovation as the &quot;real driver of progress&quot; and pronounced that &quot;America's way better today than it's ever been.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Gates: The Rolling Stone Interview|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/bill-gates-the-rolling-stone-interview-20140313?print=true|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=Jann S.

They have three children: daughters Jennifer Katharine (b. 1996) and Phoebe Adele (b. 2002), and son Rory John (b. 1999). The family resides in [[Bill Gates's house|the Gates's home]], an [[earth sheltering|earth-sheltered house]] in the side of a hill overlooking [[Lake Washington]] in Medina. According to [[King County, Washington|King County]] public records, as of 2006 the total assessed value of the property (land and house) is $125&amp;nbsp;million, and the annual property tax is $991,000. In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Gates stated in regard to his faith:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important. We've raised our kids in a religious way; they've gone to the Catholic church that Melinda goes to and I participate in. I've been very lucky, and therefore I owe it to try and reduce the inequity in the world. And that's kind of a religious belief. I mean, it's at least a moral belief.&lt;ref name=&quot;God&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same interview, Gates said: &quot;I agree with people like Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm – not all – that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how it came about. To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [laughs]. I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;God&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/bill-gates-the-rolling-stone-interview-20140313?page=5|title=Bill Gates: The Rolling Stone Interview|last=Goodell|first=Jeff|date=March 27, 2014|publisher=Rolling Stone|accessdate=April 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules have since been repeated in schools across the world, with the purpose of educating students on how to be successful in their future. Although the rules are commonly attributed to Gates, it is actually originally written by educator Charles Sykes in his book &quot;Dumbing Down on Our Kids,&quot; written in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.amazon.ca/Dumbing-Down-Our-Kids-Themselves/dp/0312148232|title=Dumbing Down Our Kids: Why American Children Feel Good About Themselves But Can't Read, Write, or Add|accessdate=November 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://business.illinois.edu/broker/eleven.htm|title=Eleven Things You'll never learn in school|accessdate=November 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation====
Gates studied the work of [[Andrew Carnegie]] and [[John D. Rockefeller]], and in 1994 sold some of his Microsoft stock to create the &quot;William H. Gates Foundation.&quot; In 2000, Gates and his wife combined three family foundations to create the charitable &quot;[[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]],&quot; which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013 as the world's wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly valued at more than US$34.6 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Top Ten US Charitable Foundations|url=http://www.fundsforngos.org/all-listings/worlds-top-ten-wealthiest-charitable-foundations/|work=Funds For NGOs|publisher=Funds For NGOs, LLC|accessdate=April 6, 2014|author=Robin Toal|date=September 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation allows benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the [[Wellcome Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=April 1, 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3913581.stm|title=Bill Gates: billionaire philanthropist |publisher=BBC News |date=January 25, 2005|author=Cronin, Jon  |archiveurl=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3913581.stm |archivedate=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 1, 2008|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/AboutUs/OurWork/OurApproach/|title=Our Approach to Giving |publisher=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080404212231/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/AboutUs/OurWork/OurApproach/ |archivedate = April 4, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of [[David Rockefeller]] as a major influence. Gates and his father met with Rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly modeled on the [[Rockefeller family]]'s philanthropic focus, whereby they are interested in tackling the global problems that are ignored by governments and other organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;bill foundation&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=2005 Annual Report | format= PDF |publisher=[[Rockefeller Brothers Fund]] | url=http://www.rbf.org/usr_doc/2005_Annual_Review.pdf | date=January 1, 2006 | accessdate=February 14, 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080216010301/http://www.rbf.org/usr_doc/2005_Annual_Review.pdf| archivedate= February 16, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, Bill and Melinda Gates were the second-most generous philanthropists in America, having given over US$28 billion to charity;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bwnt.businessweek.com/interactive%5Freports/philanthropy%5Findividual |title=The 50 most generous Americans |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222062206/http://www.businessweek.com/interactive_reports/philanthropy_individual.html |archivedate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the couple plan to eventually donate 95 percent of their wealth to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11565953 |title=Bill and Melinda Gates give 95% of wealth to charity |archiveurl=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11565953 |archivedate=July 19, 2012 |work=BBC News |date=October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 15, 2014, Bill Gates posted a video of himself dumping a bucket of ice water on his head, after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg challenged him to do so, in order to raise awareness for ALS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10152332454511961&amp;set=vb.216311481960&amp;type=2&amp;theater |title=Bill Gates |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=August 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personal====
Gates's wife urged people to learn a lesson from the philanthropic efforts of the Salwen family, which had sold its home and given away half of its value, as detailed in ''[[The Power of Half]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/life-style/general/they-half-it-in-them-1.686505 |title=They half it in them |newspaper=Gulf News |author=Bina Abraham |date=October 1, 2010 |accessdate=March 17, 2011 |archiveurl=http://gulfnews.com/life-style/general/they-half-it-in-them-1.686505 |archivedate=July 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gates and his wife invited Joan Salwen to Seattle to speak about what the family had done, and on December 9, 2010, Gates, investor [[Warren Buffett]], and [[Facebook]] founder and CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]] signed a commitment they called the &quot;Gates-Buffet [[Giving Pledge]].&quot; The pledge is a commitment by all three to donate at least half of their wealth over the course of time to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moss |first=Rosabeth |url=http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/dec2010/ca20101214_945792.htm |title=Four Strategic Generosity Lessons|work=Business Week  |date=December 14, 2010 |accessdate=March 9, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/dec2010/ca20101214_945792.htm |archivedate=July 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38556042/ns/us_news-giving/ | title= 40 billionaires pledge to give away half of wealth| accessdate=August 8, 2010 |archiveurl=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/38556042/ns/us_news-giving/ |archivedate=September 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/natural-home-living/a-rich-gift-homemade-jelly-for-bill-melinda-gates.aspx |title=A Rich Gift: Homemade Jelly for Bill and Melinda Gates |work=Mother Earth News |date=February 22, 2011 |author=Robyn Griggs Lawrence|accessdate=March 10, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.motherearthnews.com/natural-home-living/a-rich-gift-homemade-jelly-for-bill-melinda-gates.aspx |archivedate=September 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gates has also provided personal donations to educational institutions. In 1999 Gates donated US$20 million to the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) for the construction of a computer laboratory named the &quot;William H. Gates Building&quot; that was designed by architect Frank O. Gehry. While Microsoft had previously given financial support to the institution, this was the first personal donation received from Gates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Gates Donates $20 million to MIT|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1999/4/14/bill-gates-donates-20-million-to/|work=The Harvard Crimson|publisher=The Harvard Crimson, Inc|accessdate=April 6, 2014|author=Matthew G.H.

The Maxwell Dworkin Laboratory of the [[Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences]] is named after the mothers of both Gates and Microsoft President Steven A. Ballmer, both of whom were students (Ballmer was a member of the School's graduating class of 1977, while Gates left his studies for Microsoft), and donated funds for the laboratory's construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Campus TEACHING, RESEARCH, AND ADMINISTRATIVE SPACES|url=http://www.seas.harvard.edu/about-seas/map-directions/buildings|work=Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|accessdate=April 6, 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gates also donated US$6 million to the construction of the Gates Computer Science Building, completed in January 1996, on the campus of [[Stanford University]]. The building contains the Computer Science Department (CSD) and the Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) of Stanford's Engineering department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gates Computer Science Building|url=http://cs.stanford.edu/info/gates|work=Stanford Engineering|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=April 6, 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism====
{{further|Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation#Criticism}}
In 2007 the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' criticized the foundation for investing its assets in companies which have been accused of worsening poverty, polluting heavily, and pharmaceutical companies that do not sell into the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-gatesx07jan07,0,6827615.story |title=Dark butt over good works of Gates Foundation |archiveurl=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-gatesx07jan07,0,6827615.story |archivedate=September 16, 2012 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=January 7, 2007}}, ''Los Angeles Times'', January 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
