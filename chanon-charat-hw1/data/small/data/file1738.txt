'''`Abdu’l-Bahá' ''' ({{lang-ar|عبد البهاء}}&amp;lrm;, 23 May 1844 &amp;ndash; 28 November 1921), born '''‘Abbás Effendí''', was the eldest son of [[Bahá'u'lláh]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Chambers Biographical Dictionary]], ISBN 0-550-18022-2, page 2&lt;/ref&gt; the founder of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. In 1892, `Abdu'l-Bahá was appointed in his father's [[Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh#Kitáb-i-`Ahd (Book of the Covenant)|will]] to be his successor and head of the Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_abdulbaha_b&quot;&gt;{{Citation |encyclopedia= Encyclopædia Iranica |year= 1989 |article=‘Abd-al-Bahā’ : Life and work | url = http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v1f1/v1f1a064.html | first = Alessandro | last = Bausani |postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 2000 14–20&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=14–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá was born in [[Tehran]] to an aristocratic family of the realm. At the age of eight his father was imprisoned and the family's possessions were looted, leaving them in virtual poverty. Along with his father, `Abdu'l-Bahá was exiled to [[Baghdad]] where the family lived for nine years.

During his youth he was faithful to his father and was regarded as an outstanding member of the Bahá’í exile community. As a teenager he was his father’s [[amanuensis]] and was regularly seen debating theological issues with the learned men of the area. In 1863 Bahá'u'lláh was again exiled to [[Constantinople]]. During the 1860s the family was banished from Constantinople to [[Adrianople]], and then finally to the penal-colony of [[Acre, Palestine]].

With his father's death in 1892, and his appointment as head of the Bahá’í faith, there was much opposition to him, including virtually all his family members. Notwithstanding this, practically all of the worldwide Bahá’í community accepted his leadership. In 1908, at the age of 64 and after forty years imprisonment, `Abdu’l-Bahá was freed by the [[Young Turks]] and he and his family began to live in relative safety. His [[`Abdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West|journeys to the West]], and his &quot;[[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]&quot; spread the Bahá'í message beyond its middle-eastern roots, and his [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá|Will and Testament]] laid the foundation for the current &quot;[[Bahá'í administration|Bahá'í administrative order]]. Many of his writings, prayers and letters are extant, and his discourses with the Western Bahá'ís emphasize the growth of the faith by the late 1890s. `Abdu'l-Bahá's [[given name]] was `Abbás, but he preferred the title of `Abdu'l-Bahá (servant of the glory of God). He is commonly referred to in Bahá'í texts as &quot;The Master&quot;, and received the title of [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] after his personal storage of grain was used to relieve famine in [[Palestine]] following [[World War I]], but never used the title.

==Early life==
`Abdu'l-Bahá was born in [[Tehran]], Iran on 23 May 1844 (5th of [[Jumada al-awwal|Jamadiyu'l-Avval]], 1260 AH),&lt;ref name=&quot;Qazvini&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://bahai-library.com/qazvini_abdulbaha_prominent_iranians |title= `Abdu'l-Bahá Meeting with Two Prominent Iranians |accessdate=5 September 2007 | author= Muhammad Qazvini |year= 1949 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the eldest son of [[Bahá'u'lláh]] and [[Ásíyih Khánum|Navváb]]. He was born on the very same night on which the [[Báb]] declared his mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Esslemont|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Born with the given name of `Abbás,&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 2000 14–20&quot;/&gt; he was named after his grandfather [[Mírzá `Abbás Núrí]], a prominent and powerful nobleman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Kazemzadeh|2009&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Kazemzadeh|2009|}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, `Abdu'l-Bahá was shaped by his father's position as a prominent [[Bábí]]. He recalled how he met the Bábí leader [[Táhirih]] and how she would take &quot;me on to her knee, caress me, and talk to me. I admired her most deeply&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blomfield|1975|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu’l-Bahá had a happy and carefree childhood. The family’s Tehran home and country houses were comfortable and beautifully decorated. `Abdu'l-Bahá enjoyed playing in the gardens with his younger sister with whom he was very close.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blomfield 1975 40&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Blomfield|1975|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with his younger siblings— a sister, [[Bahíyyih Khánum|Bahíyyih]], and a brother, [[Mírzá Mihdí|Mihdí]]— the three lived in an environment of privilege, happiness and comfort.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Kazemzadeh|2009&quot;/&gt; With his father's declination of the position as minister of the court; during his young boyhood `Abdu’l-Bahá witnessed his parents' various charitable endeavours,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blomfield|1975|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included converting part of the home to a hospital ward for women and children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blomfield 1975 40&quot;/&gt;

`Abdu'l-Bahá received a haphazard education during his childhood. It was customary not to send children of nobility to schools. Most noblemen were educated at home briefly in scripture, rhetoric, calligraphy and basic mathematics. Many were educated to prepare themselves for life in the royal court. Despite a brief spell at a traditional preparatory school at the age of seven for one year,&lt;ref&gt;Taherzadeh, p.105&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá received no formal education. As he grew he was educated by his mother, and uncle.&lt;ref&gt;Blomfield, p.68&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his education however, came from his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hogenson|2010|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later in 1890 [[Edward Granville Browne]] described how `Abdu'l-Bahá was &quot;one more eloquent of speech, more ready of argument, more apt of illustration, more intimately acquainted with the sacred books of the Jews, the Christians, and the Muhammadans...scarcely be found even amongst the eloquent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Browne|1891|p=xxxvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When `Abdu'l-Bahá was seven, he contracted tuberculosis and was expected to die.&lt;ref&gt;Hogenson, p.81&lt;/ref&gt; Though the malady faded away,&lt;ref&gt;Balyuzi, p.12&lt;/ref&gt; he would be plagued with bouts of illness for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Hogenson, p.82&lt;/ref&gt;

One event that affected `Abdu'l-Bahá greatly during his childhood was the imprisonment of his father when `Abdu'l-Bahá was eight years old; the imprisonment led to his family being reduced to poverty and being attacked in the streets by other children.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá accompanied his mother to visit [[Bahá'u'lláh]] who was then imprisoned in the infamous subterranean dungeon the [[Síyáh-Chál]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Kazemzadeh|2009&quot;/&gt; He described how &quot;I saw a dark, steep place. We entered a small, narrow doorway, and went down two steps, but beyond those one could see nothing. In the middle of the stairway, all of a sudden we heard His [Bahá’u’lláh's]…voice: 'Do not bring him in here', and so they took me back&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p12&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Baghdad ==
Bahá'u'lláh was eventually released from prison but ordered into exile, and `Abdu'l-Bahá then eight joined his father on the journey to [[Baghdad]] in the winter (January to April)&lt;ref name=&quot;Winter'sChron&quot;&gt;[http://bahai-library.com/winters_chronology_babi_persecutions Chronology of persecutions of Babis and Baha'is] compiled by Jonah Winters&lt;/ref&gt; of 1853.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p12&quot;/&gt; During the journey `Abdu'l-Bahá suffered from frost-bite. After a year of difficulties Bahá'u'lláh absented himself rather than continue to face the conflict with [[Mirza Yahya]] and secretly secluded himself in the mountains of [[Sulaymaniyah]] in April 1854 a month before `Abdu'l-Bahá's tenth birthday.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winter'sChron&quot;/&gt; Mutual sorrow resulted in him, his [[Ásíyih Khánum|mother]] and [[Bahiyyih Khánum|sister]] becoming constant companions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blomfield|1975|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá was particularly close to both, and his mother took active participation in his education and upbringing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blomfield 1975 69&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Blomfield|1975|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the two-year absence of his father `Abdu'l-Bahá took up the duty of managing the affairs of the family,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peyman.info/cl/Baha'i/Others/ROB/V2/p388-396Ch18.html The Revelation of Bahá'u'lláh, volume two], page 391&lt;/ref&gt; before his [[age of maturity]] (14 in middle-eastern society)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unrisd.org/unrisd/website/document.nsf/8b18431d756b708580256b6400399775/2e975aca2a81aa54c12576580028735c/$FILE/WebIran.pdf Can women act as agents of a democratization of theocracy in Iran?] by Homa Hoodfar, Shadi Sadr, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; and was known to be occupied with reading and, at a time of hand-copied scriptures being the primary means of publishing, was also engaged in copying the writings of the [[Báb]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p14&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu’l-Bahá also took an interest in the art of horse riding and, as he grew, became a renowned rider.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt;

In 1856, news of an ascetic carrying on discourses with local Súfí leaders that seemed to possibly be Bahá'u'lláh reached the family and friends. Immediately, family members and friends went to search for the elusive dervish – and in March&lt;ref name=&quot;Winter'sChron&quot;/&gt; brought Bahá'u'lláh back to Baghdad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith17&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2008|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; On seeing his father, `Abdu'l-Bahá fell to his knees and wept loudly &quot;Why did you leave us?&quot;, and this followed with his mother and sister doing the same.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p15&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá soon became his father's secretary and shield.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt; During the sojourn in the city `Abdu’l-Bahá grew from a boy into a young man. He was noted as a &quot;remarkably fine looking youth&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt; and remembered for his charity and amiableness.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt; Having passed the age of maturity `Abdu'l-Bahá was regularly seen in the mosques of Baghdad discussing religious topics and the scripture as a young man. Whilst in Baghdad, `Abdu'l-Bahá composed a commentary at the request of his father on the Muslim tradition of &quot;I was a Hidden Treasure&quot; for a Súfí leader named `Alí Shawkat Páshá.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;iwaht&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = 'Abdu'l-Baha's Commentary on The Islamic Tradition: &quot;I Was a Hidden Treasure ...&quot; | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_kuntu_kanzan_makhfiyyan | publisher = Baha'i Studies Bulletin 3:4 (Dec. 1985), 4–35| accessdate=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá was fifteen or sixteen at the time and `Alí Shawkat Páshá regarded the more than 11000 word essay as a remarkable feat for somebody of his age.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt; In 1863 in what became known as the [[Garden of Ridván, Baghdad|Garden of Ridván]] Bahá'u'lláh announced to a few that he was the [[manifestation of God]] and [[He whom God shall make manifest]] whose coming had been foretold by the [[Báb]]. On day eight of the twelve days, it is believed `Abdu'l-Baha was the first person Baha'u'llah revealed his claim to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paintdrawer.co.uk/david/folders/Spirituality/001=Bahai/Ridvan.pdf  Declaration of Baha'u'llah]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/bahai/holydays/ridvan.shtml The history and significance of the Bahá'í festival of Ridván] BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

== Constantinople/Adrianople ==
[[File:Brothers1868.jpg|right|thumb|160px|`Abdu'l-Bahá (right) with his brother [[Mírzá Mihdí]]]]
In 1863 Bahá'u'lláh was summoned to [[Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]), and thus his whole family including `Abdu'l-Bahá, then nineteen, accompanied him on his 110-day journey.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p17&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journey to Constantinople was another wearisome  journey,&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt; and `Abdu'l-Bahá helped feed the exiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Kazemzadeh|2009&quot;/&gt; It was here that his position became more prominent amongst the Bahá’ís.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 2000 14–20&quot;/&gt; This was further solidified by [[Bahá’u’lláh]]’s [[tablet of the Branch]] in which he constantly exalts his son's virtues and station.&lt;ref name=&quot;totb&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Tablet of the Branch | url = http://bahai-library.com/bahaullah_surih_ghusn | publisher = Wilmette: Baha'i Publishing Trust| accessdate=5 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family were soon exiled to [[Adrianople]] and `Abdu'l-Bahá went with the family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 2000 14–20&quot;/&gt; `Abdu’l-Bahá again suffered from frostbite.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Phelps|1912|pp=27–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Adrianople `Abdu’l-Bahá was regarded as the sole comforter of his family – in particular to his [[Ásíyih Khánum|mother]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt; At this point `Abdu'l-Bahá was known by the Bahá'ís as &quot;the Master&quot;, and by non-Bahá'ís as `Abbás Effendi (&quot;Effendi&quot; signifies &quot;Sir&quot;). It was in Adrianople that Bahá’u’lláh referred to his son as &quot;the Mystery of God&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt; The title of &quot;Mystery of God&quot; symbolises, according to Bahá'ís, that `Abdu'l-Bahá is not a [[manifestation of God]] but how a &quot;person of `Abdu'l-Bahá the incompatible characteristics of a human nature and superhuman knowledge and perfection have been blended and are completely harmonized&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcob&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = The Covenant of Bahá'u'lláh | url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/WOB/wob-39.html.utf8?query=completely&amp;action=highlight#gr8 | publisher = US Bahá’í Publishing Trust | accessdate=5 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bwo&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = The World Order of Bahá’u’lláh | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_kuntu_kanzan_makhfiyyan | publisher = Baha'i Studies Bulletin 3:4 (Dec. 1985), 4–35| accessdate=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá was at this point noted for having black hair which flowed to his shoulders, large blue eyes, alabaster coloured skin and a slight Roman nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gail|1987|p=281}}{{citation not found}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bahá'u'lláh gave his son many other titles such as &quot;the Most Mighty Branch&quot; the &quot;Branch of Holiness&quot;, &quot;the Center of the Covenant&quot; and the apple of his eye.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 2000 14–20&quot;/&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá (&quot;the Master&quot;) was devastated when hearing the news that he and his family were to be exiled separately from [[Bahá'u'lláh]]. It was, according to Bahá'ís, through his intercession that the idea was reverted and the family were allowed to be exiled together.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt;

== Acre ==
[[File:AkkaPrison.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Prison in Acre]]
At the age of 24, `Abdu'l-Bahá was clearly chief-steward to his father and an outstanding member of the Bahá’í community.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p17&quot;/&gt; Bahá’u’lláh and his family were – in 1868 – exiled to the penal colony of [[Acre, Palestine]] where it was expected that the family would perish.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Foltz|2004|pp=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrival in Acre was distressing for the family and exiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith 2000 14–20&quot;/&gt; They were greeted in a hostile manner by the surrounding population and his sister and father fell dangerously ill.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt; When told that the women were to sit on the shoulders of the men to reach the shore, `Abdu'l-Bahá took a chair and carried the women to the bay of Acre.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá was able to procure some anesthetic and nursed the sick.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt; The Bahá’ís were imprisoned under horrendous conditions in a cluster of cells covered in excrement and dirt.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá himself fell dangerously ill with [[dysentery]],&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt; however a sympathetic soldier permitted a physician to help cure him.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt; The population shunned them, the soldiers treated them the same, and the behaviour of Siyyid Muhammad-i-Isfahani (an [[Azali]]) did not help matters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Kazemzadeh|2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p17&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morale was further destroyed with the accidental death of `Abdu'l-Bahá’s youngest brother [[Mírzá Mihdí]] at the age of 22.&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt; His death devastated the family – particularly his [[Ásíyih Khánum|mother]] and father – and the grieving `Abdu'l-Bahá kept a night-long vigil beside his brother’s body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Kazemzadeh|2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lotoae&quot; /&gt;

=== Later in Acre ===
Over time, he gradually took over responsibility for the relationships between the small [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'i]] exile community and the outside world. It was through his interaction with the people of Acre that, according to the Bahá'ís, they recognized the innocence of the Bahá'ís, and thus the conditions of imprisonment were eased.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p33&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|pp=33–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four months after the death of Mihdí the family moved from the prison to the [[House of `Abbúd]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p33&quot; /&gt; The people of Acre started to respect the Bahá'ís and in particular, `Abdu'l-Bahá. `Abdu'l-Bahá was able to arrange for [[House of `Abbúd#Akk.C3.A1 area|houses to be rented]] for the family, the family later moved to the [[Mansion of Bahjí]] around 1879 when an epidemic caused the inhabitants to flee.

`Abdu'l-Bahá soon became very popular in the penal colony and [[Myron Henry Phelps]] a wealthy New York lawyer described how &quot;a crowd of human beings...Syrians, Arabs, Ethiopians, and many others&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phelps|1912|pp=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; all waited to talk and receive `Abdu'l-Bahá.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2000|pp=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He undertook a history of the Bábí religion through publication of [[A Traveller's Narrative]] (Makála-i-Shakhsí Sayyáh) in 1886,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/B/browne/tn/tnfrnt.htm A Traveller's Narrative, (Makála-i-Shakhsí Sayyáh)]&lt;/ref&gt; later translated and published in translation in 1891 through Cambridge University by the agency of [[Edward Granville Browne]] who described `Abdu'l-Bahá as: {{quote|Seldom have I seen one whose appearance impressed me more.

===Marriage and family life===
[[File:Abbaseffendi1868.jpg|right|thumb|190px|`Abdu'l-Bahá at age 24]]
As a young man speculation was rife amongst the Bahá’ís to whom `Abdu'l-Bahá would marry.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hogenson, p.87&lt;/ref&gt; Several young girls were seen as marriage prospects but `Abdu’l-Bahá seemed disinclined to marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt; On 8 March 1873, at the urging of his father,&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Kazemzadeh|2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ma'ani|2008|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; the twenty-eight-year-old `Abdu’l-Bahá married [[Munírih Khánum|Fátimih Nahrí of Isfahán]] (1847–1938) a twenty-five-year-old noblewoman.&lt;ref name=Smith2000-p255&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|2000|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was Mírzá Muḥammad `Alí Nahrí of [[Isfahan]] an eminent Bahá’í of the city and prominent aristocrat.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt; Fátimih was brought from [[Persia]] to [[Acre, Israel]] after both [[Bahá’u’lláh]] and his wife [[Navváb]] expressed an interest in her to marry `Abdu’l-Bahá.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith2000-p255/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ltoae&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Phelps|1912|pp=85–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a wearisome journey from Isfahán to Akka she finally arrived accompanied by her brother in 1872.&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ltoae&quot;/&gt; The young couple were betrothed for about five months before the marriage itself commenced. In the mean time, Fátimih lived in the home of `Abdu'l-Bahá’s uncle [[Mírzá Músá]]. According to her later memoirs, Fátimih fell in love with `Abdu'l-Bahá on seeing him. `Abdu'l-Bahá himself had showed little inkling to marriage until meeting Fátimih;&lt;ref name=&quot;ltoae&quot;/&gt; who was entitled Munírih by [[Bahá’u’lláh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvnb|Kazemzadeh|2009&quot;/&gt; Munírih is a title meaning &quot;Luminous&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;aittbf&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2008|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The marriage resulted in nine children. The first born was a son Mihdí Effendi who died aged about 3. He was followed by Ḍiyá'iyyih &lt;u&gt;Kh&lt;/u&gt;ánum, Fu’ádíyyih &lt;u&gt;Kh&lt;/u&gt;ánum (d. few years old), Rúhangíz Khánum (d. 1893), Túbá Khánum, Husayn Effendi (d.1887 aged 5), Túbá &lt;u&gt;Kh&lt;/u&gt;ánum, Rúhá &lt;u&gt;Kh&lt;/u&gt;ánum and Munnavar &lt;u&gt;Kh&lt;/u&gt;ánum. The death of his children caused `Abdu’l-Bahá immense grief – in particular the death of his son Husayn Effendi came at a difficult time following the death of his mother and uncle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ma'ani|2008|p=323}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving children (all daughters) were; Ḍiyá'iyyih &lt;u&gt;Kh&lt;/u&gt;ánum (mother of [[Shoghi Effendi]]) (d. 1951) Túbá &lt;u&gt;Kh&lt;/u&gt;ánum (1880–1959) Rúḥá &lt;u&gt;Kh&lt;/u&gt;ánum and Munavvar &lt;u&gt;Kh&lt;/u&gt;ánum (d. 1971).&lt;ref name=&quot;bne&quot; /&gt; [[Bahá'u'lláh]] wished that the Bahá'ís follow the example of `Abdu'l-Bahá and gradually move away from polygamy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ltoae&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aittbf&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ma'ani|2008|p=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage of `Abdu’l-Bahá to one woman and his choice to remain monogamous,&lt;ref name=&quot;ltoae&quot;/&gt; from advice of his father and his own wish,&lt;ref name=&quot;ltoae&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aittbf&quot;/&gt; legitimised the practice of monogamy&lt;ref name=&quot;aittbf&quot;/&gt; to a people whom hitherto had regarded polygamy as a righteous way of life.&lt;ref name=&quot;ltoae&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aittbf&quot;/&gt;

==Early years of his ministry==
[[Image:Baha (Lafayette).jpg|thumb|left|150px|`Abdu&amp;#39;l-Bahá]]
After Bahá'u'lláh died on 29 May 1892, the [[Tablets of Bahá'u'lláh#Kitáb-i-`Ahd (Book of the Covenant)|Will and Testament]] of Bahá'u'lláh named `Abdu'l-Bahá as Centre of the Covenant, successor and interpreter of Bahá'u'lláh's writings.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_abdulbaha_b&quot; /&gt; In the Will and Testament `Abdu'l-Bahá's half-brother, [[Mírzá Muhammad `Alí|Muhammad `Alí]], was mentioned by name as being subordinate to `Abdu'l-Bahá. Muhammad `Alí became jealous of his half-brother and set out to establish authority for himself as an alternative leader with the support of his brothers Badi'u'llah and Diya'u'llah.&lt;ref name=&quot;Qazvini&quot; /&gt; He began correspondence with Bahá'ís in Iran, initially in secret, casting doubts in others' minds about `Abdu'l-Bahá.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p53&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most Bahá'ís followed `Abdu'l-Bahá, a handful followed Muhammad `Alí including such leaders as Mirza Javad and Ibrahim Khayru'llah, the famous Bahá'í missionary to America.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1918|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad `Alí and Mirza Javad began to openly accuse `Abdu'l-Bahá of taking on too much authority, suggesting that he believed himself to be a [[Manifestation of God]], equal in status to Bahá'u'lláh.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1918|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was at this time that `Abdu'l-Bahá, in order to provide proof of the falsity of the accusations leveled against him, in tablets to the West, stated that he was to be known as &quot;`Abdu'l-Bahá&quot; an [[Arabic language|Arabic]] phrase meaning the Servant of Bahá to make it clear that he was not a Manifestation of God, and that his station was only servitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p60&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TAB/tab-473.html.utf8?query=my%7Cname%7Cabdul&amp;action=highlight#gr5| title = Tablets of Abdul-Baha Abbas | author = Abdul-Baha }}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá left a [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá|Will and Testament]] that set up the framework of administration. The two highest institutions were the Universal House of Justice, and the Guardianship, for which he appointed [[Shoghi Effendi]] as the ''Guardian''.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_abdulbaha_b&quot; /&gt;

=== First Western pilgrims ===

By the end of 1898, Western pilgrims started coming to Akka on pilgrimage to visit `Abdu'l-Bahá; this group of pilgrims, including [[Phoebe Hearst]], was the first time that Bahá'ís raised up in the West had met `Abdu'l-Bahá.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p69&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first group arrived in 1898 and throughout late 1898 to early 1899 Western Bahá’ís sporadically visited `Abdu'l-Bahá. The group was relatively young containing mainly women from high American society in their 20s.&lt;ref&gt;Hogenson, p.x&lt;/ref&gt; The group of Westerners aroused suspicion for the authorities, and consequently `Abdu'l-Bahá’s confinement was tightened.&lt;ref&gt;Hogenson, p.308&lt;/ref&gt; During the next decade `Abdu'l-Bahá would be in constant communication with Bahá'ís around the world, helping them to teach the religion; the group included [[May Maxwell|May Ellis Bolles]] in Paris, Englishman [[Thomas Breakwell]], American Herbert Hopper,  French Hippolyte Dreyfus, Susan Moody, Lua Getsinger, and American Laura Clifford Barney.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p72&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|pp=72–96}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Laura Clifford Barney who, by asking questions of `Abdu'l-Bahá over many years and many visits to Haifa, compiled what later became the book [[Some Answered Questions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p82&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ministry, 1901–1912===

During the final years of the 19th century, while `Abdu'l-Bahá was still officially a prisoner and confined to `Akka, he organized the transfer of the remains of the [[Báb]] from Iran to Palestine.  He then organized the purchase of land on [[Mount Carmel]] that Bahá'u'lláh had instructed should be used to lay the remains of the Báb, and organized for the construction of the [[Shrine of the Báb]]. This process took another 10 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p90-93&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|pp=90–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increase of pilgrims visiting `Abdu'l-Bahá, Muhammad `Alí worked with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman authorities]] to re-introduce stricter terms on `Abdu'l-Bahá's imprisonment in August 1901.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_abdulbaha_b&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p94&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|pp=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1902, however, due to the Governor of `Akka being supportive of `Abdu'l-Bahá, the situation was greatly eased; while pilgrims were able to once again visit `Abdu'l-Bahá, he was confined to the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p94&quot; /&gt; In February 1903, two followers of Muhammad `Alí, including Badi'u'llah and Siyyid `Aliy-i-Afnan, broke with Muhammad `Ali and wrote books and letters giving details of Muhammad `Ali's plots and noting that what was circulating about `Abdu'l-Bahá was fabrication.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p102&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Afroukhteh|2003|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1902 to 1904, in addition to the building of the [[Shrine of the Báb]] that `Abdu'l-Bahá was directing, he started to put into execution two different projects; the restoration of the [[House of the Báb]] in [[Shiraz, Iran]] and the construction of the first [[Bahá'í House of Worship]] in [[Ashgabat]], Turkmenistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p107&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;  `Abdu'l-Bahá asked Aqa Mirza Aqa to coordinate the work so that the house of the Báb would be restored to the state that it was at the time of the Báb's declaration to [[Mulla Husayn]] in 1844;&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p107&quot; /&gt;  he also entrusted the work on the House of Worship to [[Vakil-u'd-Dawlih]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p109&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1904, Muhammad `Ali continued his accusations against `Abdu'l-Bahá which caused an Ottoman commission summoning `Abdu'l-Bahá to answer the accusations levelled against him. During the inquiry the charges against him were dropped and the inquiry collapsed.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p111&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|pp=111–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Momen|1981|pp=320–323}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next few years in `Akka were relatively free of pressures and pilgrims were able to come and visit `Abdu'l-Bahá.  By 1909 the mausoleum of the Shrine of the Báb was completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p109&quot;/&gt;

==Journeys to the West==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]] --&gt;
[[Image:Abdulbaha2.jpg|thumb|`Abdu'l-Bahá, during his trip to the United States]]

{{main|`Abdu'l-Bahá's journeys to the West}}

The 1908 [[Young Turks]] revolution freed all political prisoners in the Ottoman Empire, and `Abdu'l-Bahá was freed from imprisonment. His first action after his freedom was to visit the [[Shrine of Bahá'u'lláh]] in [[Bahji]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p131&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; While `Abdu'l-Bahá continued to live in `Akka immediately following the revolution, he soon moved [[House of `Abdu'l-Bahá|to live]] in [[Haifa]] near the Shrine of the Báb.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p131&quot; /&gt; In 1910, with the freedom to leave the country, he embarked on a three-year journey to [[Egypt]], Europe, and North America, spreading the Bahá'í message.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_abdulbaha_b&quot; /&gt;

From August to December 1911, `Abdu'l-Bahá visited cities in Europe, including London, Bristol, and Paris. The purpose of these trips was to support the Bahá'í communities in the west and to further spread his father's teachings.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_end&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|pp=159–397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following year, he undertook a much more extensive journey to the United States and Canada to once again spread his father's teachings.  He arrived in New York City on 11 April 1912, after declining an offer of passage on the [[RMS Titanic]], telling the Bahá'í believers, instead, to &quot;Donate this to charity.&quot; He instead travelled on a slower craft, the S.S. Cedric, and cited preference of a longer sea journey as the reason.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p171&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arriving in New York, he arranged a private meeting with the survivors of the ill-fated [[RMS Titanic|Titanic]], who asked him if he knew the Titanic's ultimate destruction would occur, to which, 'Abdu'l-Baha replied, &quot;God gives man feelings of intuition&quot;. While he spent most of his time in New York, he visited Chicago, [[Cleveland]], [[Pittsburgh]], Washington, D.C., Boston and [[Philadelphia]]. In August of the same year he started a more extensive journey to places including [[New Hampshire]], the [[Green Acre]] school in [[Maine]], and [[Montreal]] (his only visit to Canada). He then travelled west to [[Minneapolis]], San Francisco, [[Stanford University|Stanford]], and Los Angeles before starting to return east at the end of October. On 5 December 1912 he set sail back to Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_end&quot; /&gt;

During his visit to North America he visited many missions, churches, and groups, as well as having scores of meetings in Bahá'ís' homes, and offering innumerable personal meetings with hundreds of people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallagher196&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Gallagher|Ashcraft|2006|p=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his talks he proclaimed Bahá'í principles such as the [[God in the Bahá'í Faith|unity of God]], [[Bahá'í Faith and the unity of religion|unity of the religions]], [[Bahá'í Faith and the unity of humanity|oneness of humanity]], [[Bahá'í Faith and gender equality|equality of women and men]], world peace and economic justice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallagher196&quot;/&gt; He also insisted that all his meetings be open to all races.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallagher196&quot;/&gt;

His visit and talks were the subject of hundreds of newspaper articles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallagher196&quot;/&gt; In Boston newspaper reporters asked `Abdu'l-Bahá why he had come to America, and he stated that he had come to participate in conferences on peace and that just giving warning messages is not enough.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p232&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá's visit to Montreal provided notable newspaper coverage; on the night of his arrival the editor of the ''[[Montreal Daily Star]]'' met with him and that newspaper along with [[The Montreal Gazette]], ''Montreal Standard'', [[Le Devoir]] and [[La Presse (Canada)|La Presse]] among others reported on `Abdu'l-Bahá's activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanderHoonaard56&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Van den Hoonaard|1996|pp=56–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p256&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headlines in those papers included &quot;Persian Teacher to Preach Peace&quot;, &quot;Racialism Wrong, Says Eastern Sage, Strife and War Caused by Religious and National Prejudices&quot;,  and &quot;Apostle of Peace Meets Socialists, Abdul Baha's Novel Scheme for Distribution of Surplus Wealth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p256&quot;/&gt;  The ''Montreal Standard'', which was distributed across Canada, took so much interest that it republished the articles a week later; the Gazette published six articles and Montreal's largest French language newspaper published two articles about him.&lt;ref name=&quot;vanderHoonaard56&quot;/&gt; His 1912 visit to Montreal also inspired humourist [[Stephen Leacock]] to parody him in his bestselling 1914 book ''[[Arcadian Adventures with the Idle Rich]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, Ralph D. [http://bahai-library.com/leacock_yahi_bahi_society Yahi-Bahi Society of Mrs. Resselyer-Brown, The]. Accessed on: 19 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In Chicago one newspaper headline included &quot;His Holiness Visits Us, Not Pius X but A. Baha,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p256&quot;/&gt; and `Abdu'l-Bahá's visit to California was reported in the ''Palo Altan''.&lt;ref name=&quot;b_p313&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|p=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in Europe, he visited London, Paris (where he stayed for two months), [[Stuttgart]], [[Budapest]], and [[Vienna]]. Finally on 12 June 1913 he returned to [[Egypt]], where he stayed for six months before returning to [[Haifa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b_end&quot; /&gt;

==Final years==
[[Image:AAbdul-baha late life.jpg|thumb|275px|`Abdu'l-Bahá on Mount Carmel with pilgrims in 1919]]
During World War I `Abdu'l-Bahá stayed in Palestine, under the continued threat of Allied bombardment and threats from the Turkish commander. As the war ended, the British Mandate over Palestine brought relative security to `Abdu'l-Bahá. During his final year, a growing number of visitors and pilgrims came to see him in [[Haifa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b_end2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Balyuzi|2001|pp=400–431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 April 1920, he was awarded a [[knighthood]] ([[Order of the British Empire|KBE]]) by the [[British Mandate of Palestine]] for his humanitarian efforts during the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_abdulbaha_b&quot; /&gt; `Abdu'l-Bahá died on 28 November 1921 (27th of [[Rabi' al-awwal|Rabi'u'l-Avval]], 1340 AH.)&lt;ref name=&quot;Qazvini&quot; /&gt; On his funeral, Esslemont notes:
:&quot;... a funeral the like of which Haifa, nay Palestine itself, had surely never seen... so deep was the feeling that brought so many thousands of mourners together, representative of so many religions, races and tongues&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Esslemont|1980|p=77}}, quoting 'The Passing of `Abdu'l-Bahá&quot;, by Lady Blomfield and Shoghi Effendi, pp 11, 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is buried in the front room of the [[Shrine of the Báb]] on [[Mount Carmel]]. Plans are in place to one day build a [[Shrine of `Abdu'l-Bahá]]. In his [[Will and Testament of `Abdu'l-Bahá|Will and Testament]] he appointed his grandson [[Shoghi Effendi|Shoghi Effendi Rabbani]] as the Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_abdulbaha_b&quot; /&gt;

==Works==
The total estimated number of [[Tablet (religious)|tablets]] that `Abdu'l-Bahá wrote are over 27,000, of which only a fraction have been translated into English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://bahai-library.com/uhj_numbers_sacred_writings | title = Numbers and Classifications of Sacred Writings texts | author = Universal House of Justice |date=September 2002 | accessdate =20 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His works fall into two groups including first his direct writings and second his lectures and speeches as noted by others.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_abdulbaha_b&quot;/&gt;  The first group includes ''[[The Secret of Divine Civilization]]'' written before 1875, ''A Traveller's Narrative'' written around 1886, the Resāla-ye sīāsīya or ''Sermon on the Art of Governance'' written in 1893, the ''Memorials of the Faithful'', and a large number of [[tablets (religious)|tablets]] written to various people;&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_abdulbaha_b&quot;/&gt; including various Western intellectuals such as [[August Forel]] which has been translated and published as the [[Tablet to Dr. Forel|Tablet to Auguste-Henri Forel]]. The ''Secret of Divine Civilization'' and the ''Sermon on the Art of Governance'' were widely circulated anonymously.

The second group includes [[Some Answered Questions]], which is an English translation of a series of table talks with Laura Barney, and [[Paris Talks]], ''`Abdu'l-Baha in London'' and ''Promulgation of Universal Peace'' which are respectively addresses given by `Abdu'l-Bahá in Paris, London and the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;iranica_abdulbaha_b&quot;/&gt;
