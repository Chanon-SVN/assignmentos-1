On August 23 a German spearhead penetrated the city's northern suburbs, and the [[Luftwaffe]] rained incendiary bombs that destroyed most of the city's wooden housing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a major battle of [[World War II]] in which [[Nazi Germany]] and its allies fought the [[Soviet Union]] for control of the city of [[Volgograd|Stalingrad (now Volgograd)]] in the south-western Soviet Union.

Marked by constant [[Close combat|close quarters combat]] and direct assaults on civilians by [[Luftwaffe|air raids]], it was the single largest and [[List of battles by casualties|bloodiest battle in the history of warfare]]. The heavy losses inflicted on the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' make it arguably the most strategically decisive battle of the whole war.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1998) Vol IV, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; It was a turning point in the [[European theatre of World War II]]–the German forces never regained the initiative in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|East]] and withdrew a vast military force from the [[Western Front (World War II)|West]] to replace their losses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bellamy2007&quot;&gt;Bellamy, (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The German offensive to capture Stalingrad began in late summer 1942 using the [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|6th Army]] and elements of the [[4th Panzer Army]]. The attack was supported by intensive ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' bombing that reduced much of the city to rubble. The fighting degenerated into [[Urban warfare|building-to-building fighting]], and both sides poured reinforcements into the city. By mid-November 1942, the Germans had pushed the Soviet defenders back at great cost into narrow zones generally along the west bank of the [[Volga River]].

On 19 November 1942, the [[Red Army]] launched [[Operation Uranus]], a two-pronged attack targeting the weaker [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]]n and [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920-1946)|Hungarian]] forces protecting the German 6th Army's flanks.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (1998: 239)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces on the flanks were overrun and the 6th Army was [[encirclement|cut off and surrounded]] in the Stalingrad area. [[Adolf Hitler]] ordered that the army stay in Stalingrad and make no attempt to break out; instead, attempts were made to supply the army by air and to break the encirclement from the outside. Heavy fighting continued for another two months. By the beginning of February 1943, the Axis forces in Stalingrad had exhausted their ammunition and food. The remaining elements of the 6th Army surrendered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shirer1990&quot;&gt;Shirer (1990)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p.932|date=June 2011}} The battle lasted five months, one week, and three days.

==Historical background==
By the spring of 1942, despite the failure of [[Operation Barbarossa]] to decisively defeat the [[Soviet Union]] in a single campaign, the war had been progressing well for the Germans: the [[Battle of the Atlantic (1939–1945)|U-Boat offensive]] in the [[Atlantic]] had been very successful and [[Erwin Rommel|Rommel]] had just captured [[Tobruk#Capture of Tobruk|Tobruk]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kershaw2000&quot;&gt;Kershaw, (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p.522|date=June 2011}}  In the east, they had stabilized their front in a line running from [[Leningrad]] in the north to [[Rostov-on-Don|Rostov]] in the south. There were a number of [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salients]] in the line where Soviet offensives had pushed the Germans back (notably to the northwest of [[Moscow]] and south of [[Kharkov]]) but these were not particularly threatening. Hitler was confident that he could master the [[Red Army]] after the winter of 1942, because even though [[Army Group Centre]] (''Heeresgruppe Mitte'') had suffered heavy punishment west of Moscow the previous winter, 65% of its infantry had not been engaged and had been rested and re-equipped. Neither Army Group North nor Army Group South had been particularly hard pressed over the winter.&lt;ref name=&quot;TaylorClark1974&quot;&gt;Taylor and Clark, (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p.144|date=June 2011}}  Stalin was expecting the main thrust of the German summer attacks to again be directed against Moscow.&lt;ref name=Bellamy2007/&gt;{{Rp|p.498|date=June 2011}}

The Germans decided that their summer campaign in 1942 would be directed at the southern parts of the Soviet Union. The initial objectives in the region around Stalingrad were the destruction of the industrial capacity of the city and the deployment of forces to block the [[Volga River]]. The river was a key route from the [[Caucasus]] and the [[Caspian Sea]] to central Russia. Its capture would disrupt commercial river traffic. The Germans cut the pipeline from the oilfields when they captured Rostov on 23 July. The capture of Stalingrad would make the delivery of [[Lend Lease]] supplies via the [[Persian Corridor]] much more difficult.&lt;ref name=Shirer1990/&gt;{{Rp|909|date=June 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;P.M.H. Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, p 96&lt;/ref&gt;

The German operations were initially very successful. On 23 July 1942, Hitler personally rewrote the operational objectives for the 1942 campaign, greatly expanding them to include the occupation of the city of Stalingrad. Both sides began to attach propaganda value to the city based on it bearing the name of the leader of the Soviet Union. It was assumed that the fall of the city would also firmly secure the northern and western flanks of the German armies as they advanced on [[Baku]] with the aim of securing these strategic petroleum resources for Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kershaw2000&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|p.528|date=June 2011}}  The expansion of objectives was a significant factor in Germany's failure at Stalingrad. It was based on a sort of victory fever and an underestimation of Soviet reserves.&lt;ref name=walsh2000&gt;Walsh, Stephen. (2000). ''Stalingrad 1942–1943 The Infernal Cauldron''. London, New York: Simon &amp; Schuster. ISBN 0-7432-0916-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviets realized that they were under tremendous constraints of time and resources and ordered that anyone strong enough to hold a rifle be sent to fight.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p.94|date=June 2011}}

==Prelude==

===Case Blue===
{{main|Case Blue}}

{{quote|text=If I do not get the oil of Maikop and Grozny then I must finish [''liquidieren; to kill off, liquidate''] this war.|sign=Adolf Hitler&lt;ref name=&quot;Kershaw2000&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|p.514|date=June 2011}}|20px}}
[[Army Group South]] was selected for a sprint forward through the southern Russian [[steppe]]s into the [[Caucasus]] to capture the vital Soviet [[oil field]]s [[Petroleum industry in Azerbaijan#World War II|there]]. The planned summer offensive was [[Code name|code-named]] ''Fall Blau'' ([[Case Blue]]). It was to include the German [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|6th]], [[17th Army (Wehrmacht)|17th]], [[German Fourth Panzer Army|4th Panzer]] and [[1st Panzer Army|1st Panzer]] Armies. Army Group South had overrun the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] in 1941. Poised in Eastern [[Ukraine]], it was to spearhead the offensive.

Hitler intervened, however, ordering the [[Army Group]] to split in two. Army Group South (A), under the command of [[Wilhelm List]], was to continue advancing south towards the Caucasus as planned with the 17th Army and First Panzer Army. Army Group South (B), including [[Friedrich Paulus]]'s 6th Army and [[Hermann Hoth]]'s 4th Panzer Army, was to move east towards the Volga and Stalingrad. [[Army Group B]] was commanded initially by [[Field Marshal]] [[Fedor von Bock]] and later by General [[Maximilian von Weichs]].&lt;ref name=Shirer1990/&gt;{{Rp|p.915|date=June 2011}}

The start of ''Case Blue'' had been planned for late May 1942. However, a number of German and [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] units that were involved in ''Blau'' were then in the process of [[Siege of Sevastopol (1942)|besieging Sevastopol]] on the [[Crimean Peninsula]]. Delays in ending the siege pushed back the start date for ''Blau'' several times, and the city did not fall until the end of June. A smaller action was taken in the meantime, pinching off a Soviet [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] in the [[Second Battle of Kharkov]], which resulted in the [[envelopment]] of a large Soviet force on 22 May.
[[File:German Summer Offensive, 7 May-23 July 1942.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The German advance to the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] between 7 May and 23 July.]]

''Blau'' finally opened as Army Group South began its attack into southern Russia on 28 June 1942. The German offensive started well. Soviet forces offered little resistance in the vast empty steppes and started streaming eastward. Several attempts to re-establish a defensive line failed when German units [[flanking maneuver|outflanked]] them. Two major pockets were formed and destroyed: the first, northeast of Kharkov, on 2 July, and a second, around [[Millerovo]], [[Rostov Oblast]], a week later. Meanwhile, the [[Second Army (Hungary)|Hungarian 2nd Army]] and the German 4th Panzer Army had launched an [[Battle of Voronezh (1942)|assault on Voronezh]], capturing the city on 5 July.

The initial advance of the 6th Army was so successful that Hitler intervened and ordered the 4th Panzer Army to join Army Group South (A) to the south. A massive [[traffic jam]] resulted when the 4th Panzer and the 1st Panzer both required the few roads in the area. Both armies were stopped dead while they attempted to clear the resulting mess of thousands of vehicles. The delay was long, and it is thought that it cost the advance at least one week. With the advance now slowed, Hitler changed his mind and re-assigned the 4th Panzer Army back to the attack on Stalingrad.

By the end of July, the Germans had pushed the Soviets across the [[Don River, Russia|Don River]]. At this point, the Don and Volga Rivers were only {{convert|65|km|mi|abbr=on}} apart, and the Germans left their main supply depots west of the Don, which had important implications later in the course of the battle. The Germans began using the armies of their [[Italian war in Soviet Union, 1941-1943|Italian]], Hungarian and [[Romanian Armies in the Battle of Stalingrad|Romanian]] allies to guard their left (northern) flank. The Italians won several accolades in official German communiques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|quotes=|last=German High Command (communique)|first=|authorlink=|date=27 October 1941|year=|title=Text of the Day's War Communiques|journal=New York Times|volume=|issue=28 October 1941| pages=|issn=|pmid=|doi =|id=|url=http://collections.civilisations.ca/warclip/objects/common/webmedia.php?irn=5000808|accessdate=27 April 2009|laysummary=|laysource=|laydate=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|quotes=|last=German High Command (communique)|first=|authorlink=|date=10 November 1942|year=|title=Text of the Day's War Communiques on Fighting in Various Zones| journal=New York Times|volume=|issue=10 November 1942|pages=|issn=|pmid=|doi=|id=|url= http://collections.civilisations.ca/warclip/objects/common/webmedia.php?irn=5001262| accessdate=27 April 2009|laysummary=|laysource=|laydate=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|quotes=| last=German High Command (communique)|first=|authorlink=|date=26 August 1942|year=|title=Text of the Day's War Communiques on Fighting in Various Zones|journal= New York Times| volume=|issue=26 August 1942|pages=|issn=|pmid=|doi=|id=|url=http://collections.civilisations.ca/warclip/objects/common/webmedia.php?irn=5001240|accessdate=27 April 2009|laysummary=| laysource=|laydate=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|quotes=|last=German High Command (communique) |first=|authorlink=|date=12 December 1942|year=|title=Text of the Day's War Communiques|journal=New York Times|volume=|issue=12 December 1942|pages=|issn=|pmid=|doi=|id=|url= http://collections.civilisations.ca/warclip/objects/common/webmedia.php?irn=5001290| accessdate =27 April 2009|laysummary=|laysource=|laydate=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes they were held in little regard by the Germans, and were even accused of  cowardice and low morale: in reality, the Italian divisions fought comparatively well, with the [[3rd Mountain Infantry Division Ravenna]] and [[5th Infantry Division Cosseria]] proving to have good morale, according to a German liaison officer&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;In spite of the unfavourable balance of forces - the 'Cosseria' and the 'Ravenna' faced eight to nine Russian divisions and an unknown number of tanks - the atmosphere among Italian staffs and troops was certainly not pessimistic.... The Italians, especially the officers of the 'Cosseria', had confidence in what they thought were well built defensive positions.&quot;'' All or Nothing: The Axis and the Holocaust 1941-43, Jonathan Steinberg, p. ?, Routledge, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and being forced to retreat only after a massive armoured attack in which German reinforcements had failed to arrive in time, according to a German historian.&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;The attack at dawn failed to penetrate fully at first and developed into a grim struggle with Italian strongpoints, lasting for hours. The Ravenna Division was the first to be overrun. A gap emerged that was hard to close, and there was no holding back the Red Army when it deployed the mass of its tank forces the following day. German reinforcements came too late in the breakthrough battle.&quot;'' The Unknown Eastern Front: The Wehrmacht and Hitler's Foreign Soldiers, Rolf-Dieter Müller, p. 84, I.B.Tauris, 28 Feb 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed the Italians distinguished themselves in numerous battles, as in the [[battle of Nikolayevka]].

The German 6th Army was only a few dozen kilometers from Stalingrad, and 4th Panzer Army, now to their south, turned northwards to help take the city. To the south, [[Army Group A]] was pushing far into the Caucasus, but their advance slowed as supply lines grew overextended. The two German army groups were not positioned to support one another due to the great distances involved.

After German intentions became clear in July 1942, Stalin appointed [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] [[Andrey Yeryomenko]] as commander of the Southeastern Front on 1 August 1942. Yeryomenko and [[Commissar]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]] were tasked with planning the defense of Stalingrad.&lt;ref name=Craig73&gt;Craig, (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p.25, 48|date=May 2009}} The eastern border of Stalingrad was the wide River Volga, and over the river, additional Soviet units were deployed. These units became the newly formed 62nd Army, which Yeryomenko placed under the command of [[Lieutenant general|Lt. Gen.]] [[Vasily Chuikov|Vasiliy Chuikov]] on 11 September 1942. The situation was extremely dire. When asked how he interpreted his task, he responded &quot;We will defend the city or die in the attempt.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Beevor1998&quot;&gt;Beevor (1998), 198.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p.127|date=June 2011}} The 62nd Army's mission was to defend Stalingrad at all costs. Chuikov's generalship during the battle earned him one of his two [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] awards.

==Attack on Stalingrad==
[[File:German Summer Offensive, 24 July-18 November.PNG|thumb|upright=1.4|The German advance to Stalingrad between 24 July and 18 November]]

On 23 August the 6th Army reached the outskirts of Stalingrad in pursuit of the [[62nd Army (Soviet Union)|62nd]] and 64th Armies, which had fallen back into the city. [[Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist|Kleist]] later said after the war:&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark, Lloyd 2011, page 157&quot;&gt;Clark, Lloyd, ''Kursk: The Greatest Battle: Eastern Front 1943'', 2011, page 157&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;The capture of Stalingrad was subsidiary to the main aim. It was only of importance as a convenient place, in the bottleneck between Don and the Volga, where we could block an attack on our flank by Russian forces coming from the east. At the start, Stalingrad was no more than a name on the map to us.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark, Lloyd 2011, page 157&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Soviets had enough warning of the Germans' advance to ship grain, cattle, and railway cars across the Volga and out of harm's way but most civilian residents were not evacuated. This &quot;harvest victory&quot; left the city short of food even before the German attack began. Before the ''[[German Army (1935–45)|Heer]]'' reached the city itself, the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' had rendered the River Volga, vital for bringing supplies into the city, unusable to Soviet shipping. Between 25 and 31 July, 32 Soviet ships were sunk, with another nine crippled.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007&gt;Bergström, Christer, (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p.69|date=May 2009}}

The battle began with the heavy bombing of the city by ''Generaloberst'' [[Wolfram von Richthofen]]'s ''[[Luftflotte 4]]'', which in the summer and autumn of 1942 was the most powerful single air [[formation (military)|formation]] in the world. Some 1,000 tons of bombs were dropped in 48 hours, more than in London at the height of the Blitz.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|p.122|date=May 2009}} Much of the city was quickly turned to rubble, although some factories continued production while workers joined in the fighting.

Stalin rushed all available troops to the east bank of the Volga, some from as far away as [[Siberia]]. All the regular ferries were quickly destroyed by the Luftwaffe, which then targeted troop barges being towed slowly across the river by tugs. Many civilians were evacuated across the Volga.&lt;ref name=Craig73&gt;Craig (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; It has been said that Stalin prevented civilians from leaving the city in the belief that their presence would encourage greater resistance from the city's defenders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beevor1998&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|p.106|date=June 2011}} Civilians, including women and children, were put to work building [[trench]]works and protective fortifications.

The [[Soviet Air Force]], the ''Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily'' (VVS), was swept aside by the Luftwaffe. The VVS bases in the immediate area lost 201 aircraft between 23 and 31 August, and despite meager reinforcements of some 100 aircraft in August, it was left with just 192 serviceable aircraft, 57 of which were fighters.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|p.74|date=May 2009}} The Soviets continued to pour aerial reinforcements into the Stalingrad area in late September, but continued to suffer appalling losses; the ''Luftwaffe'' had complete control of the skies.

The burden of the initial defense of the city fell on the [[1077th Anti-Aircraft Regiment]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Beevor1998&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|p.106|date=June 2011}} a unit made up mainly of young female volunteers who had no training for engaging ground targets.

The [[German 16th Panzer Division]] reportedly had to fight the 1077th's gunners &quot;shot for shot&quot; until all 37 anti-aircraft guns were destroyed or overrun. The German 16th Panzer Division was shocked to find that, due to Soviet manpower shortages, it had been fighting female soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beevor1998&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|p.108|date=June 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stalingrad-info.com/stalingrad1942.htm|title=Stalingrad 1942| accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early stages of the battle, the NKVD organized poorly armed &quot;Workers' [[militia]]s&quot; composed of civilians not directly involved in war production for immediate use in the battle.

By the end of August, Army Group South (B) had finally reached the Volga, north of Stalingrad. Another advance to the river south of the city followed. By 1 September, the Soviets could only reinforce and supply their forces in Stalingrad by perilous crossings of the Volga under constant bombardment by artillery and aircraft.

On 5 September, the Soviet 24th and [[66th Army|66th]] Armies organized a massive attack against [[XIV Panzer Corps]]. The ''Luftwaffe'' helped repulse the offensive by heavily attacking Soviet artillery positions and defensive lines. The Soviets were forced to withdraw at midday after only a few hours. Of the 120 tanks the Soviets had committed, 30 were lost to air attack.&lt;ref name= Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|p.75|date=May 2009}}
[[File:Streetfight Stralingrad01.jpg|thumb|upright|A street fight in Stalingrad]]

Soviet operations were constantly hampered by the ''Luftwaffe''. On 18 September, the Soviet [[1st Guards Army (Soviet Union)|1st Guards]] and [[24th Army (Soviet Union)|24th Army]] launched an offensive against VIII Army Corps at Kotluban. ''[[8th Air Corps (Germany)|VIII. Fliegerkorps]]'' dispatched wave after wave of [[Stuka]] dive-bombers to prevent a breakthrough. The offensive was repulsed. The Stukas claimed 41 of the 106 Soviet tanks knocked out that morning, while escorting [[Bf 109]]s destroyed 77 Soviet aircraft.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|p.80|date=May 2009}}
Amid the debris of the wrecked city, the Soviet [[62nd Army|62nd]] and 64th [[Army (Soviet Army)|Armies]], which included the Soviet [[13th Guards Rifle Division]], anchored their defense lines with strongpoints in houses and factories.

Fighting within the ruined city was fierce and desperate. Lieutenant General [[Alexander Rodimtsev]] was in charge of the 13th Guards Rifle Division, and received one of two [[Hero of the Soviet Union|Heroes of the Soviet Union]] awarded during the battle for his actions. Stalin's [[Order No. 227]] of 27 July 1942 decreed that all commanders who ordered unauthorized retreat would be subject to a military tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (1998), 84-5, 97, 144.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was the [[NKVD]] that ordered the regular army and lectured them, on the need to show some guts. Through brutal coercion for self-sacrifice, thousands of deserters and presumed malingerers were executed to discipline the troops. At Stalingrad alone, 14,000 soldiers of the Red Army were executed in order to keep the formation.&lt;ref name=&quot;G.F.Krivosheev1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krivosheev|first1=G.

The Germans pushing forward into Stalingrad suffered heavy casualties.

===Fighting in the city===
By 12 September, at the time of their retreat into the city, the Soviet 62nd Army had been reduced to 90 tanks, 700 mortars and just 20,000 personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beevor1998&quot;/&gt; The remaining tanks were used as immobile strongpoints within the city. The initial German attack attempted to take the city in a rush. One infantry division went after the Mamayev Kurgan, one attacked the central rail station and one attacked toward the central landing stage on the Volga.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 169-0526, Russland, Scharfschütze in Stellung.jpg|thumb|left|A German sniper in Stalingrad]]

Though initially successful, the German attacks stalled in the face of Soviet reinforcements brought in from across the Volga. The 13th Guards Rifle Division, assigned to counterattack at the Mamayev Kurgan and at Railway Station No. 1 suffered particularly heavy losses. Over 30 percent of its soldiers were killed in the first 24 hours, and just 320 out of the original 10,000 survived the entire battle. Both objectives were retaken, but only temporarily. The railway station changed hands 14 times in six hours. By the following evening, the 13th Guards Rifle Division had ceased to exist. So great were Soviet losses that at times, the [[life expectancy]] of a newly arrived soldier was less than a day, and the life expectancy of a Soviet officer was three days.

Combat raged for three days at the giant grain elevator in the south of the city. About fifty Red Army defenders, cut off from resupply, held the position for five days and fought off ten different assaults before running out of ammunition and water. Only forty dead Soviet fighters were found, though the Germans had thought there were many more due to the intensity of resistance. The Soviets burned large amounts of grain during their retreat in order to deny the enemy food. Paulus chose the grain elevator and silos as the symbol of Stalingrad for a patch he was having designed to commemorate the battle after a German victory.

German [[military doctrine]] was based on the principle of [[Combined arms|combined-arms teams]] and close cooperation between tanks, infantry, [[Military engineer|engineers]], artillery and [[Ground attack aircraft|ground-attack aircraft]]. Some Soviet commanders adopted the tactic of always keeping their front-line positions as close to the Germans as physically possible; Chuikov called this &quot;hugging&quot; the Germans. This slowed the German advance and reduced the effectiveness of the German advantage in supporting fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;russiatoday&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=TV Novosti|title=Crucial WW2 battle remembered|url=http://www.russiatoday.com/Top_News/2009-02-02/Crucial_WW2_battle_remembered.html| accessdate=19 February 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090309114524/http://russiatoday.com/Top_News/2009-02-02/Crucial_WW2_battle_remembered.html| archivedate= 9 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red Army gradually adopted a strategy to hold for as long as possible all the ground in the city. Thus, they converted multi-floored apartment blocks, factories, warehouses, street corner residences and office buildings into a series of well defended strongpoints with small 5–10 man units.&lt;ref name=&quot;russiatoday&quot;/&gt; Manpower in the city was constantly refreshed by bringing additional troops over the Volga. When a position was lost, an immediate attempt was usually made to re-take it with fresh forces.

[[File:Stalingrad - ruined city.jpg|thumb|left|[[Red Army|Soviet soldiers]] in the Red October Factory]]
Bitter fighting raged for every ruin, street, factory, house, basement, and staircase. Even the sewers were the sites of firefights. The Germans, calling this unseen [[urban warfare]] ''Rattenkrieg'' (&quot;Rat War&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;Bellamy (2007), 514-517.&lt;/ref&gt; bitterly joked about capturing the kitchen but still fighting for the living room and the bedroom. Buildings had to be cleared room by room through the bombed-out debris of residential neighborhoods, office blocks, basements and apartment high-rises. Some of the taller buildings, blasted into roofless shells by earlier German aerial bombardment, saw floor-by-floor, [[Close combat|close quarters combat]], with the Germans and Soviets on alternate levels, firing at each other through holes in the floors.&lt;ref name=&quot;russiatoday&quot;/&gt;

Fighting on and around [[Mamayev Kurgan]], a prominent hill above the city, was particularly merciless; indeed, the position changed hands many times.&lt;ref name=Craig73/&gt;{{Rp|p?|date=May 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (1998), 135-137.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pavlov's House.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pavlov's House]] (1943)]]
In another part of the city, a Soviet [[platoon]] under the command of Sergeant [[Yakov Pavlov]] fortified a four-story building that oversaw a square 300 meters from the river bank, later called ''[[Pavlov's House]]''. The soldiers surrounded it with minefields, set up machine-gun positions at the windows and breached the walls in the basement for better communications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beevor1998&quot;/&gt; The soldiers found about ten Soviet civilians hiding in the basement. They were not relieved, and not significantly reinforced, for two months. The building was labeled ''Festung'' (&quot;Fortress&quot;) on German maps. Sgt. Pavlov was awarded the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] for his actions.

[[File:Soviet marines-in the battle of stalingrad volga banks.jpg|left|thumb|right|Soviet marines landing on the west bank of the [[Volga River]].]]

The Germans made slow but steady progress through the city. Positions were taken individually, but the Germans were never able to capture the key crossing points along the river bank. The Germans used airpower, tanks and [[heavy artillery]] to clear the city with varying degrees of success. Toward the end of the battle, the gigantic [[Dora (artillery)|railroad gun]] nicknamed ''Dora'' was brought into the area. The Soviets built up a large number of artillery batteries on the east bank of the Volga. This artillery was able to bombard the German positions or at least to provide counter-battery fire.

Snipers on both sides used the ruins to inflict casualties. The most famous [[Soviet sniper]] in Stalingrad was [[Vasily Zaytsev]],&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (1998), 203-206.&lt;/ref&gt; with 225 confirmed kills during the battle. Targets were often soldiers bringing up food or water to forward positions. Artillery spotters were an especially prized target for snipers.

A significant historical debate concerns the degree of terror in the Red Army. The British historian [[Antony Beevor]] noted the &quot;sinister&quot; message from the Stalingrad Front's Political Department on 8 October 1942 that: &quot;The defeatist mood is almost eliminated and the number of treasonous incidents is getting lower&quot; as an example of the sort of coercion Red Army soldiers experienced under the Special Detachments (later to be renamed [[SMERSH]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Beevor2004&quot;&gt;Beevor (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p.154–168|date=June 2011}} On the other hand, Beevor noted the often extraordinary bravery of the Soviet soldiers in a battle that was only comparable to [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], and argued that terror alone cannot explain such self-sacrifice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beevor1998&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|p.154–168|date=June 2011}} Richard Overy addresses the question of just how important the Red Army's coercive methods were to the Soviet war effort compared with other motivational factors such as hatred for the enemy. He argues that, though it is &quot;easy to argue that from the summer of 1942 the Soviet army fought because it was forced to fight,&quot; to concentrate solely on coercion is nonetheless to &quot;distort our view of the Soviet war effort.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Overy, Richard. Russia's War (New York: 1997), 201.&lt;/ref&gt; After conducting hundreds of interviews with Soviet veterans on the subject of terror on the Eastern Front – and specifically about Order No. 227 (&quot;Not a step back!&quot;) at Stalingrad – Catherine Merridale notes that, seemingly paradoxically, &quot;their response was frequently relief.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Merridale, Catherine. Ivan's War (New York: 2006), 156.&lt;/ref&gt; Infantryman Lev Lvovich's explanation, for example, is typical for these interviews; as he recalls, &quot;[i]t was a necessary and important step. We all knew where we stood after we had heard it. And we all – it's true – felt better. Yes, we felt better.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Merridale, Catherine. Ivan's War (New York: 2006), 156.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Stalingradska zemlja.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Soil after the battle of Stalingrad in the Vladimir Military Museum]]

Many women fought on the Soviet side, or were under fire. As General Chuikov acknowledged, &quot;Remembering the defence of Stalingrad, I can't overlook the very important question&amp;nbsp;... about the role of women in war, in the rear, but also at the front. Equally with men they bore all the burdens of combat life and together with us men, they went all the way to Berlin.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bellamy (2007), 520-521.&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the battle there were 75,000 women and girls from the Stalingrad area who had finished military or medical training, and all of whom were to serve in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Pennington, pp. 180–182.&lt;/ref&gt; Women staffed a great many of the anti-aircraft batteries that fought not only the Luftwaffe but German tanks.&lt;ref&gt;Pennington, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet nurses not only treated wounded personnel under fire but were involved in the highly dangerous work of bringing wounded soldiers back to the hospitals under enemy fire.&lt;ref&gt;Pennington, pp. 189–192.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Soviet wireless and telephone operators were women who often suffered heavy casualties when their command posts came under fire.&lt;ref&gt;Pennington, pp. 192–194.&lt;/ref&gt; Though women were not usually trained as infantry, many Soviet women fought as machine gunners, mortar operators, and scouts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pennington p.197&quot;&gt;Pennington, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Women were also snipers at Stalingrad.&lt;ref&gt;Pennington, pp. 201–204.&lt;/ref&gt; Three air regiments at Stalingrad were entirely female.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pennington p.197&quot;/&gt; At least three women won the title Hero of the Soviet Union while driving tanks at Stalingrad.&lt;ref&gt;Pennington, pp. 204–207.&lt;/ref&gt;

For both Stalin and Hitler, Stalingrad became a matter of prestige far beyond its strategic significance.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Werth, The Year of Stalingrad (London: 1946), 193-194.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet command moved units from the Red Army strategic reserve in the Moscow area to the lower Volga, and transferred aircraft from the entire country to the Stalingrad region.

The strain on both military commanders was immense: Paulus developed an uncontrollable tic in his eye, which eventually afflicted the left side of his face, while Chuikov experienced an outbreak of [[eczema]] that required him to have his hands completely bandaged. Troops on both sides faced the constant strain of close-range combat.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor (1998), 141-142.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air attacks===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J20510, Russland, Kampf um Stalingrad, Luftangriff crop.jpg|thumb|left|[[Junkers Ju 87|Junkers Ju 87 ''Stuka'']] dive bomber over the neighborhood west of the Red October factory; some of the administration buildings are at lower right; Bayonet Gully is at top right.]]
Determined to crush Soviet resistance, ''Luftflotte'' 4's ''Stukawaffe'' flew 900 individual sorties against Soviet positions at the [[Volgograd Tractor Factory|''Dzerzhinskiy'' Tractor Factory]] on 5 October. Several Soviet regiments were wiped out; the entire staff of the Soviet 339th Infantry Regiment was killed the following morning during an air raid.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|p.83|date=May 2009}}

In mid-October, the ''Luftwaffe'' intensified its efforts against remaining Red Army positions holding the west bank. ''Luftflotte'' 4 flew 2,000 sorties on 14 October and {{convert|550|t|ST|lk=on|abbr=on}} of bombs were dropped while German infantry surrounded the three factories. ''Stukageschwader'' 1, 2, and 77 had largely silenced Soviet artillery on the eastern bank of the Volga before turning their attention to the shipping that was once again trying to reinforce the narrowing Soviet pockets of resistance. The 62nd Army had been cut in two, and, due to intensive air attack on its supply ferries, was receiving much less material support. With the Soviets forced into a 1 kilometer (1000 yards) strip of land on the western bank of the Volga, over 1,208 ''Stuka'' missions were flown in an effort to eliminate them.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|p.84|date=May 2009}}

The ''Luftwaffe'' retained [[air superiority]] into November and Soviet daytime aerial resistance was nonexistent. However, the combination of constant air support operations on the German side and the Soviet surrender of the daytime skies began to affect the strategic balance in the air. After flying 20,000 individual sorties, the ''Luftwaffe''{{'s}} original strength of 1,600 serviceable aircraft had fallen to 950. The ''Kampfwaffe'' (bomber force) had been hardest hit, having only 232 out of a force of 480 left.&lt;ref name=hayward98&gt;Hayward, (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p.95|date=May 2009}} The ''VVS'' remained qualitatively inferior, but by the time of the Soviet counter-offensive, the ''VVS'' had reached numerical superiority.

[[File:IAR-80.jpg|thumb|Romanian [[IAR 80]] fighter planes.]]
The Soviet bomber force, the ''Aviatsiya Dal'nego Deystviya'' ([[Long Range Aviation]]; ADD), having taken crippling losses over the past 18 months, was restricted to flying at night. The Soviets flew 11,317 night sorties over Stalingrad and the Don-bend sector between 17 July and 19 November. These raids caused little damage and were of nuisance value only.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|p.82|date=May 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;Golovanov, (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|265|date=June 2011}}

On 8 November, substantial units from ''Luftflotte'' 4 were withdrawn to combat [[Operation Torch|the Allied landings in North Africa]]. The German air arm found itself spread thinly across Europe, struggling to maintain its strength in the other southern sectors of the Soviet-German front.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;8,314 German aircraft were produced from July–December 1942, but this could not keep pace with a three-front aerial war of attrition&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets began receiving material assistance from the American government under the [[Lend-Lease]] program. During the last quarter of 1942, the U.S. sent the Soviet Union {{convert|45000|t|ST|abbr=on}} of explosives and {{convert|230000|t|ST|abbr=on}} of aviation gas.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p.404|date=June 2011}}

As historian Chris Bellamy notes, the Germans paid a high strategic price for the aircraft sent into Stalingrad: the ''Luftwaffe'' was forced to divert much of its air strength away from the oil-rich Caucasus, which had been Hitler's original grand-strategic objective.&lt;ref&gt;Bellamy (2007), 516.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany reaches the Volga===
After three months of slow advance, the Germans finally reached the river banks, capturing 90% of the ruined city and splitting the remaining Soviet forces into two narrow pockets. Ice floes on the Volga now prevented boats and tugs from supplying the Soviet defenders. Nevertheless, the fighting, especially on the slopes of Mamayev Kurgan and inside the factory area in the northern part of the city, continued.

==Soviet counter-offensives==
[[File:RIAN archive 44732 Soviet soldiers attack house.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Soviet soldiers attack a house, February 1943]]
Recognizing that German troops were ill prepared for offensive operations during the winter of 1942, and that most of them were redeployed elsewhere on the southern sector of the Eastern Front, the [[Stavka]] decided to conduct a number of offensive operations between 19 November 1942 and 2 February 1943. These operations opened the Winter Campaign of 1942–1943 (19 November 1942&amp;nbsp;– 3 March 1943), which involved some 15 Armies operating on several fronts.

===Weakness on the German flanks===
During the siege, the German and allied [[Italian war in Soviet Union, 1941-1943|Italian]], Hungarian, and Romanian armies protecting Army Group B's [[Flanking maneuver|flanks]] had pressed their [[headquarters]] for support. The Hungarian 2nd Army was given the task of defending a {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} section of the front north of Stalingrad between the Italian Army and [[Voronezh]]. This resulted in a very thin line, with some sectors where {{convert|1|–|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} stretches were being defended by a single [[platoon]]. These forces were also lacking in effective anti-tank weapons.

Because of the total focus on the city, the [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces had neglected for months to even consolidate their positions along the natural defensive line of the Don River. The Soviet forces were allowed to retain bridgeheads on the right bank from which offensive operations could be quickly launched. These bridgeheads in retrospect presented a serious threat to Army Group B.&lt;ref name=Shirer1990/&gt;{{Rp|p.915|date=June 2011}}

Similarly, on the southern flank of the Stalingrad sector the front southwest of [[Kotelnikovo]] was held only by the Romanian [[7th Army Corps (Romania)|7th Army Corps]], and beyond it, a single German division, the [[16th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)|16th Motorized Infantry]].

===Operation Uranus: the Soviet offensive===

In autumn, the Soviet generals [[Georgy Zhukov]] and [[Aleksandr Vasilevsky]], responsible for strategic planning in the Stalingrad area, concentrated forces in the steppes to the north and south of the city. The northern flank was defended by Hungarian, and Romanian units, often in open positions on the steppes. The natural line of defense, the Don river, had never been properly established by the German side. The armies in the area were also poorly equipped in terms of anti-tank weapons. The plan was to punch through the overstretched and weakly defended German flanks and surround the German forces in the Stalingrad region.

During the preparations for the attack, [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|Marshal]] Zhukov personally visited the front and noticing the poor organization, insisted on a one-week delay in the start date of the planned attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beevor1998&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|p.117|date=May 2009}} The operation was code-named &quot;Uranus&quot; and launched in conjunction with [[Operation Mars]], which was directed at [[Army Group Center]]. The plan was similar to the one Zhukov had used to achieve victory at [[Battle of Khalkhin Gol|Khalkhin Gol]] three years before, where he had sprung a [[pincer movement|double envelopment]] and destroyed the [[IJA 23d Division|23rd Division]] of the Japanese army.&lt;ref&gt;Maps of the conflict.

On 19 November 1942, the [[Red Army]] launched Operation Uranus. The attacking Soviet units under the command of Gen. [[Nikolay Vatutin]] consisted of three complete armies, the [[Soviet First Guards Army|1st Guards Army]], [[5th Guards Tank Army|5th Tank Army]], and 21st Army, including a total of 18 infantry [[Division (military)|divisions]], eight tank [[brigade]]s, two [[Mechanized force|motorized]] brigades, six [[cavalry]] divisions and one anti-tank brigade. The preparations for the attack could be heard by the Romanians, who continued to push for reinforcements, only to be refused again. Thinly spread, deployed in exposed positions, outnumbered and poorly equipped, the [[Romanian Third Army|Romanian 3rd Army]], which held the northern flank of the German 6th Army, was overrun.

Behind the front lines, no preparations had been made to defend key points in the rear such as [[Kalach-na-Donu|Kalach]]. The local response by the ''Wehrmacht'' was both chaotic and indecisive. Poor weather prevented effective air action against the Soviet offensive.

On 20 November, a second Soviet offensive (two armies) was launched to the south of Stalingrad against points held by the Romanian [[4th Army Corps (Romania)|4th Army Corps]]. The Romanian forces, made up primarily of infantry, were overrun by large numbers of tanks. The Soviet forces raced west and met on 23 November at the town of [[Kalach-na-Donu|Kalach]]; sealing the ring around Stalingrad.&lt;ref name=Shirer1990/&gt;{{Rp|p.926|date=June 2011}} The link-up of the Soviet forces, not filmed at the time, was later re-enacted for a [[propaganda]] film which was shown worldwide.

About 265,000 German, Romanian, Italian soldiers,&lt;ref&gt;Manstein (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} the 369th (Croatian) Reinforced Infantry Regiment, and other volunteer subsidiary troops including some 40,000 Soviet volunteers fighting for the Germans (Beevor states that one quarter of the sixth army's frontline strength were [[Hiwi (volunteer)|HIWI]]s, as collaborationists recruited from the ranks of Soviet POWs were called){{citation needed|date=October 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, Antony (1999). Stalingrad. London: Penguin. p. 184. ISBN 0-14-024985-0. Beevor states that one quarter of the sixth army's frontline strength were HIWIs. Note: this reference still does not directly support the claim that there were 40,000 HIWIs&lt;/ref&gt; were surrounded. These Soviet HIWIs remained loyal, knowing the Soviet penalty for helping the Germans was [[summary execution]]. German strength in the pocket was about 210,000 according to strength breakdowns of the 20 field divisions (average size 9,000) and 100 battalion sized units of the Sixth Army on 19 November 1942. Inside the [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets#Pocket|pocket]] ({{lang-de|[[Salients, re-entrants and pockets#Kessel|Kessel]]}}, literally &quot;cauldron&quot;), there were also around 10,000 Soviet civilians and several thousand Soviet soldiers the Germans had taken captive during the battle. Not all of the 6th Army was trapped; 50,000 soldiers were brushed aside outside the pocket. These belonged mostly to the other 2 divisions of the 6th Army between the Italian and Romanian Armies: the 62nd and 298th Infantry Divisions. Of the 210,000 Germans, 10,000 remained to fight on, 105,000 surrendered, 35,000 left by air and the remaining 60,000 died.

The Red Army units immediately formed two defensive fronts: a [[circumvallation]] facing inward and a [[contravallation]] facing outward. Field Marshal [[Erich von Manstein]] advised Hitler not to order the 6th Army to break out, stating that he could successfully break through the Soviet lines and relieve the besieged 6th Army.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, Gerhard ''A World In Arms'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005 page 451&lt;/ref&gt; The American historians Williamson Murray and Alan Millet wrote that it was Manstein's message to Hitler on 24 November advising him that the 6th Army should not break out, along with Göring's statements that the Luftwaffe could supply Stalingrad that &quot;...&amp;nbsp;sealed the fate of the Sixth Army.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Williamson &amp; Millet, Alan ''War To Be Won'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2000 page 288.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1945, Manstein claimed that he told Hitler that the 6th Army must break out.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg ''A World In Arms'', 2005 451.&lt;/ref&gt; The American historian [[Gerhard Weinberg]] wrote that Manstein distorted his record on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, 2005 ''A World In Arms'', page 1045.&lt;/ref&gt; Manstein was tasked to conduct a relief operation, named [[Operation Winter Storm]] (''Unternehmen Wintergewitter'') against Stalingrad, which he thought was feasible if the 6th Army was temporarily supplied through the air.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerhard Weinberg|Weinberg, Gerhard]] ''A World At Arms'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005, pp. 408; 449; 451.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manstein 2004, pp. 315; 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Hitler]] had declared in a public speech (in the [[Berlin Sportpalast]]) on 30 September 1942 that the German army would never leave the city. At a meeting shortly after the Soviet [[encirclement]], German army chiefs pushed for an immediate breakout to a new line on the west of the Don, but Hitler was at his Bavarian retreat of Obersalzberg in [[Berchtesgaden]] with the head of the ''Luftwaffe'', [[Hermann Göring]]. When asked by Hitler, Göring replied, after being convinced by [[Hans Jeschonnek]],&lt;ref name=hayward98/&gt;{{Rp|p.234|date=May 2009}} that the [[Luftwaffe]] could supply the 6th Army with an &quot;[[airbridge (logistics)|air bridge]].&quot; This would allow the Germans in the city to fight on temporarily while a relief force was assembled.&lt;ref name=Shirer1990/&gt;{{Rp|926|date=June 2011}} A similar plan had been used a year earlier at the [[Demyansk Pocket]], albeit on a much smaller scale: a corps at Demyansk rather than an entire army.

The director of ''Luftflotte'' 4, [[Wolfram von Richthofen]], tried to get this decision overturned. The forces under 6th Army were almost twice as large as a regular German army unit, plus there was also a corps of the 4th Panzer Army trapped in the pocket. The maximum {{convert|107|t|ST|abbr=on}} they could deliver a day—based on the number of available aircraft and with only the airfield at Pitomnik to land at—was far less than the minimum {{convert|750|t|ST|abbr=on}} needed.&lt;ref name=hayward98/&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;Shirer p. 926 says that &quot;Paulus radioed that they would need a minimum of 750 tons of supplies day flown in,&quot; while Craig pp. 206–207 quotes Zeitzler as pressing Goering about his boast that the Luftwaffe could airlift the needed supplies: &quot;Are you aware&amp;nbsp;... how many daily sorties the army in Stalingrad will need?&amp;nbsp;... Seven hundred tons! Every day!&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; To supplement the limited number of [[Junkers Ju 52]] transports, the Germans pressed other aircraft into the role, such as the [[Heinkel He 177]] bomber (some bombers performed adequately—the [[Heinkel He 111]] proved to be quite capable and was much faster than the Ju 52). General Richthofen informed Manstein on 27 November of the small transport capacity of the Luftwaffe and the impossibility of supplying 300 tons a day by air. Manstein now saw the enormous technical difficulties of a supply by air of these dimensions. The next day he made a six-page situation report to the general staff. Based on the information of the expert Richthofen, he declared that contrary to the example of the pocket of Demjansk the permanent supply by air would be impossible. If only a narrow link could be established to Sixth Army, he proposed that this should be used to pull it out from the encirclement. He acknowledged the heavy moral sacrifice the giving up of Stalingrad means but this is made easier to bear by the conservation of the combat power of Sixth Army and the regaining of the initiative&amp;nbsp;...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kehrig, Manfred ''Stalingrad'', Stuttgart: Deutsche Verlags Anstalt, 1974 pages 279,311-312,575.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he ignored the limited mobility of the army and the difficulties of disengaging the Soviets. Hitler reiterated that Sixth Army would stay at Stalingrad and that the air bridge would supply it until the encirclement was broken by a new German offensive.

The ''Luftwaffe'' was able to deliver an average of {{convert|85|t|ST|abbr=on}} of supplies per day out of an air transport capacity of {{convert|106|t|ST|abbr=on}} per day. The most successful day, 19 December, delivered {{convert|262|t|ST|abbr=on}} of supplies in 154 flights.

In the early parts of the operation, fuel was shipped at a higher priority than food and ammunition because of a belief that there would be a breakout from the city.&lt;ref name=walsh2000/&gt;{{Rp|p.153|date=June 2009}} Transport aircraft also evacuated technical specialists and sick or wounded personnel from the besieged enclave. Sources differ on the number flown out: at least 25,000 to at most 35,000. Carell: 42,000, of which 5000 did not survive.

[[File:RIAN archive 602161 Center of Stalingrad after liberation.jpg|thumb|The center of Stalingrad after liberation]]
Initially, supply flights came in from the field at [[Tatsinskaya Airfield|Tatsinskaya]], called 'Tazi' by the German pilots. On 23 December, the Soviet 24th Tank Corps, commanded by Major-General [[Vasily Badanov|Vasily Mikhaylovich Badanov]], reached nearby Skassirskaya and in the early morning of 24 December, [[Tatsinskaya Raid|the tanks reached Tatsinskaya]]. Without any soldiers to defend the airfield, it was abandoned under heavy fire; in a little under an hour, 108 Ju 52s and 16 [[Junkers Ju 86|Ju 86s]] took off for [[Novocherkassk]]—leaving 72 Ju 52s and many other aircraft burning on the ground. A new base was established some {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Stalingrad at [[Salsk]], the additional distance another obstacle to the resupply efforts. Salsk was abandoned in turn by mid-January for a rough facility at Zverevo, near Shakhty. The field at Zverevo was attacked repeatedly on 18 January and a further 50 Ju 52s were destroyed. Winter weather conditions, technical failures, heavy Soviet [[anti-aircraft gun|anti-aircraft]] fire and fighter interceptions eventually led to the loss of 488 German aircraft.

In spite of the failure of the German offensive to reach 6th Army, the air supply operation continued under ever more difficult circumstances. The 6th Army slowly starved. Pilots were shocked to find the troops too exhausted and hungry to unload. Germans fought over the slightest scraps of bread. General [[Kurt Zeitzler|Zeitzler]], moved by their plight, began to limit himself to their slim rations at meal times. After a few weeks on such a diet, he had lost {{convert|12|kg|lb|abbr=on}} and had become so emaciated that Hitler, annoyed, personally ordered him to start eating regular meals again.

The toll on the ''Transportgruppen'' was heavy. 160 aircraft were destroyed and 328 were heavily damaged (beyond repair). Some 266 Junkers Ju 52s were destroyed; one-third of the fleet's strength on the Eastern Front. The He 111 ''gruppen'' lost 165 aircraft in transport operations. Other losses included 42 Ju 86s, 9 [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200|Fw 200]] Condors, 5 He 177 bombers and 1 [[Junkers Ju 290|Ju 290]]. The ''Luftwaffe'' also lost close to 1,000 highly experienced bomber crew personnel.&lt;ref name=hayward98/&gt;{{Rp|p.310|date=May 2009}} So heavy were the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s losses that four of ''Luftflotte'' 4's transport units (KGrzbV 700, KGrzbV 900, I./KGrzbV 1 and II./KGzbV 1) were &quot;formally dissolved.&quot;&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|p.122|date=May 2009}}

==The end of the battle==

===Operation Winter Storm===
{{Main|Operation Winter Storm}}

Soviet forces consolidated their positions around Stalingrad, and fierce fighting to shrink the pocket began. Operation Winter Storm (''Operation Wintergewitter''), the German attempt led by [[Erich von Manstein]] to relieve the trapped army from the south, was initially successful. The cross country ability of German tanks in the snow may have slowed the relief attempts. By 19 December, the German Army had pushed to within 48&amp;nbsp;km (30&amp;nbsp;mi) of Sixth Army's positions. The encircled forces at Stalingrad made no attempt to break out or link up with the Manstein's advance. Some German officers requested that Paulus defy Hitler's orders to stand fast and instead attempt to break out of the Stalingrad pocket. Paulus refused. On 23 December, the attempt to relieve Stalingrad was abandoned and Manstein's forces switched over to the defensive to deal with new Soviet offensives.

===Operation Little Saturn===
{{Main|Operation Little Saturn}}
[[File:OperationLittleSaturn.PNG|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Soviet gains (shown in blue) during Operation Little Saturn]]

On 16 December, the Soviets launched Operation Little Saturn, which attempted to punch through the Axis army (mainly Italians) on the Don and take [[Rostov-on-Don|Rostov]]. The Germans set up a &quot;mobile defense&quot; of small units that were to hold towns until supporting armor arrived. From the Soviet bridgehead at Mamon, 15 divisions—supported by at least 100 tanks—attacked the Italian Cosseria and Ravenna Divisions, and although outnumbered 9 to 1, the Italians initially fought well, with the Germans praising the quality of the Italian defenders,&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;During this phase, the Germans praised the steadfastness of Italian infantry, who held out tenaciously even in isolated strongpoints but eventually reached their breaking-point under this constant pressure. &quot;'' The Unknown Eastern Front: The Wehrmacht and Hitler's Foreign Soldiers, Rolf-Dieter Müller, p. 83-84, I.B.Tauris, 28 Feb 2014&lt;/ref&gt; but on 19 December, with the Italian lines disintegrating ARMIR headquarters ordered the battered divisions to withdraw to new lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Paoletti|first=Ciro|title=A Military History of Italy|publisher=Praeger Security International|location=Westport, CT|year=2008|page=177| isbn=0-275-98505-9|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Uz8eiwzEMHQC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=Ariete+tanks+fight!#PPA177,M1|accessdate=4 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fighting forced a total revaluation of the German situation. The attempt to break through to Stalingrad was abandoned and Army Group A was ordered to pull back from the Caucasus.

The 6th Army now was beyond all hope of German relief. While a motorised breakout might have been possible in the first few weeks, the 6th Army now had insufficient fuel and the German soldiers would have faced great difficulty breaking through the Soviet lines on foot in harsh winter conditions. But in its defensive position on the Volga, 6th Army continued to tie down a disproportionate number of Soviet Armies.

The Germans inside the pocket retreated from the [[suburb]]s of Stalingrad to the city itself.

The Germans were now not only starving, but running out of ammunition. Nevertheless, they continued to resist, in part because they believed the Soviets would execute any who surrendered. In particular, the so-called ''[[Hiwi (volunteer)|HiWis]]'', Soviet citizens fighting for the Germans, had no illusions about their fate if captured. The Soviets were initially surprised by the number of Germans they had trapped, and had to reinforce their encircling troops. Bloody [[urban warfare]] began again in Stalingrad, but this time it was the Germans who were pushed back to the banks of the Volga. The Germans adopted a simple defense of fixing wire nets over all windows to protect themselves from grenades. The Soviets responded by fixing fish hooks to the grenades so they stuck to the nets when thrown.

The Germans had no usable tanks in the city, and those that still functioned could, at best, be used as makeshift pillboxes. The Soviets did not bother employing tanks in areas where the urban destruction restricted their mobility. A low-level Soviet envoy party (comprising Major Aleksandr Smyslov, Captain [[Nikolay Dyatlenko]] and a trumpeter) carried an offer to Paulus: if he surrendered within 24 hours, he would receive a guarantee of safety for all prisoners, medical care for the sick and wounded, prisoners allowed to keep their personal belongings, &quot;normal&quot; food rations, and [[repatriation]] to any country they wished after the war; but Paulus—ordered not to surrender by Hitler—did not respond.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p.283|date=June 2011}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-E0406-0022-001, Russland, Kesselschlacht Stalingrad.jpg|thumb|left|Soviets defend a position]]

On 22 January Paulus requested that he be granted permission to surrender. Hitler rejected it on a point of honour. He telegraphed the 6th Army later that day, claiming that it had made an historic contribution to the greatest struggle in German history and that it should stand fast &quot;to the last soldier and the last bullet.&quot; Hitler told Goebbels that the plight of the 6th Army was a &quot;heroic drama of German history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw (2000), p. 549.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January 1943, the German forces inside Stalingrad were split into two pockets. A northern pocket centered on the tractor factory and a smaller southern pocket in the city center. The northern pocket was tactically commanded by General Walter Heitz while the southern pocket was commanded by Paulus.

On 30 January 1943, the 10th anniversary of Hitler's coming to power, Goebbels read out a proclamation that included the sentence: &quot;The heroic struggle of our soldiers on the Volga should be a warning for everybody to do the utmost for the struggle for Germany's freedom and the future of our people, and thus in a wider sense for the maintenance of our entire continent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kershaw (2000), p. 550.&lt;/ref&gt; Hitler promoted Paulus to the rank of ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]''. No German field marshal had ever surrendered, and the implication was clear: if Paulus surrendered, he would shame himself and would become the highest ranking German officer ever to be captured. Hitler believed that Paulus would either fight to the last man or commit suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Bellamy (2007), 549.&lt;/ref&gt; Paulus, however, commented, &quot;I have no intention of shooting myself for this Bohemian corporal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, p.&amp;nbsp;381&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;''Für so einen Schweinehund wie den böhmischen Gefreiten erschieße ich mich nicht!'' (''I am not going to shoot myself for such a swine as this Bohemian corporal!''), quoted in: ''[http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-44435444.html Ich bitte erschossen zu werden]'', ''Der Spiegel'', 1949-01-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, the southern pocket in Stalingrad collapsed. Soviet forces reached the entrance to the German headquarters in the ruined [[State Universal Store|GUM]] department store. General Schmidt negotiated a surrender of the headquarters while Paulus waited in another room. When interrogated by the Soviets, Paulus claimed that he had not surrendered. He said that he had been taken by surprise. He denied that he was the commander of the remaining northern pocket in Stalingrad and refused to issue an order in his name for them to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Beevor, p.&amp;nbsp;390&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bellamy (2007), 550.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four Soviet armies were deployed against the remaining northern pocket. At four in the morning on 2 February, General Strecker was informed that one of his own officers had gone to the Soviets to negotiate surrender terms. Seeing no point in continuing, he sent a radio message saying that his command had done its duty and fought to the last man. He then surrendered. Around 91,000 tired, ill, wounded, and starving prisoners were taken, including 3,000 Romanians (the survivors of the 20th Infantry Division, 1st Cavalry Division and &quot;Col. Voicu&quot; Detachment).&lt;ref&gt;Pusca, Dragos; Nitu, Victor.

==Aftermath==
[[File:stalingrad aftermath.jpg|thumb|left|The aftermath of the Battle of Stalingrad]]
Based on Soviet records, over 10,000 soldiers continued to resist in isolated groups within the city for the next month.

The German public was not officially told of the impending disaster until the end of January 1943, though positive media reports had stopped in the weeks before the announcement.&lt;ref name=Lose/&gt; Stalingrad marked the first time that the Nazi government publicly acknowledged a failure in its war effort; it was not the first major setback of the German military, but a crushing defeat where German losses were almost equal to those of the Soviets was unprecedented. Prior losses of the Soviet Union were generally three times as high as the German ones.&lt;ref name=Lose/&gt; On 31 January, regular programming on German state radio was replaced by a broadcast of the somber Adagio movement from [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Seventh Symphony]], followed by the announcement of the defeat at Stalingrad.&lt;ref name=Lose&gt;Sandlin, Lee (1997).

On 18 February, [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Minister of Propaganda]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] gave the famous [[Sportpalast speech|''Sportpalast'' speech]] in Berlin, encouraging the Germans to accept a [[total war]] that would claim all resources and efforts from the entire population.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-E0406-0022-011, Russland, deutscher Kriegsgefangener.jpg|thumb|left|A [[Red Army]] soldier marches a German soldier into captivity.]]

According to the German documentary film ''[[Stalingrad (1993 film)|Stalingrad]]'' (1993), over 11,000 soldiers refused to lay down their arms at the official surrender. Some have presumed that they were motivated by a belief that fighting on was better than a slow death in Soviet captivity. The Israeli historian [[Omer Bartov]] claims they were motivated by National Socialism. He studied 11,237 letters sent by soldiers inside of Stalingrad between 20 December 1942 and 16 January 1943 to their families in Germany. Almost every letter expressed belief in Germany's ultimate victory and their willingness to fight and die at Stalingrad to achieve that victory.&lt;ref name=Bartov&gt;Bartov, Omer ''Hitler's Army'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991 pages&amp;nbsp;166–167&lt;/ref&gt; Bartov reported that a great many of the soldiers were well aware that they would not be able to escape from Stalingrad, but in their letters to their families boasted that they were proud to &quot;sacrifice themselves for the Führer&quot;.&lt;ref name=Bartov/&gt;

The remaining forces continued to resist, hiding in cellars and sewers, but by early March 1943, the remaining small and isolated pockets of resistance had surrendered. According to Soviet intelligence documents shown in the documentary, a remarkable NKVD report from March 1943 is available showing the tenacity of some of these German groups:

{{quote|The mopping-up of counter-revolutionary elements in the city of Stalingrad proceeded. The German soldiers - who had hidden themselves in huts and trenches - offered armed resistance after combat actions had already ended. This armed resistance continued until 15 February and in a few areas until 20 February. Most of the armed groups were liquidated by March&amp;nbsp;... During this period of armed conflict with the Germans, the brigade's units killed 2,418 soldiers and officers and captured 8,646 soldiers and officers, escorting them to POW camps and handing them over.}}

The operative report of the Don Front's staff issued on 5 February 1943, 22.00 said:
{{quote|The 64th Army was putting itself in order, being in previously occupied regions. Location of army's units is as it was previously.

Out of the nearly 110,000 German prisoners captured in Stalingrad, only about 5,000 ever returned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3664526/How-three-million-Germans-died-after-VE-Day.html How three million Germans died after [[VE Day]]].

''[[Telegraph Media Group|The Telegraph]]'', 18 Apr 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Already weakened by disease, starvation and lack of medical care during the encirclement, they were sent on death marches (75,000 survivors died within 3 months of capture) to prisoner camps and later to [[labour camp]]s all over the Soviet Union. Some 35,000 were eventually sent on transports, of which 17,000 did not survive. Most died of wounds, disease (particularly [[typhus]]), cold, overwork, mistreatment, and malnutrition. Some were kept in the city to help rebuild.

A handful of senior officers were taken to Moscow and used for propaganda purposes, and some of them joined the [[National Committee for a Free Germany]]. Some, including Paulus, signed anti-Hitler statements that were broadcast to German troops. Paulus testified for the prosecution during the Nuremberg Trials and assured families in Germany that those soldiers taken prisoner at Stalingrad were safe.&lt;ref name=Craig73/&gt;{{Rp|p.401|date=January 2013}} He remained in the Soviet Union until 1952, then moved to Dresden in East Germany, where he spent the remainder of his days defending his actions at Stalingrad, and was quoted as saying that Communism was the best hope for postwar Europe.&lt;ref name=Craig73/&gt;{{Rp|p.280|date=May 2009}} General [[Walther von Seydlitz-Kurzbach]] offered to raise an anti-Hitler army from the Stalingrad survivors, but the Soviets did not accept. It was not until 1955 that the last of the 5-6,000 survivors were [[Repatriation|repatriated]] (to [[West Germany]]) after a plea to the [[Politburo]] by [[Konrad Adenauer]].

==Significance==
Stalingrad has been described as the biggest defeat in the history of the German Army.&lt;ref&gt;P.M.H. Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, p 104&lt;/ref&gt; It is often identified as ''the'' turning point on the Eastern Front, and in the war against Germany overall, and even the greatest turning point in the Second World War. Before Stalingrad, Germany had gone from victory to victory, with a limited setback in the winter of 1941-42. After Stalingrad, they won no significant battles, even in summer.&lt;ref&gt;P.M.H. Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, pp 95, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Army had the initiative, and the Wehrmacht was in retreat. A year of German gains during [[Case Blue]] had been wiped out. Germany's Sixth Army had ceased to exist, and the forces of Germany's European allies, except Finland, had been shattered.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Roberts, ''Stalin's Wars: From World War to Cold War, 1939–1953'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2006, pp&amp;nbsp;154–155.&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech on 9 November 1944, Hitler himself blamed Stalingrad for Germany's impending doom.&lt;ref&gt;Antony Beevor, ''Berlin: The Downfall 1945'', Penguin Books, London, 2007, p xxxiii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stalingrad's significance has been downplayed by some historians, who point either to the [[Battle of Moscow]] or the [[Battle of Kursk]] as more strategically decisive. Others maintain that the destruction of an entire army and the frustration of Germany's grand strategy made the battle a watershed moment.&lt;ref&gt;P.M.H. Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, p 107.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, however, the battle was perceived as having global strategic consequences. On 1 January 1943, British General [[Alan Brooke]], [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff]], reflected in his diary on the change in the position from a year before:
:I felt Russia could never hold, Caucasus was bound to be penetrated, and [[Abadan]] (our Achilles heel) would be captured with the consequent collapse of Middle East, India, etc. After Russia's defeat how were we to handle the German land and air forces liberated? England would be again bombarded, threat of invasion revived... And now! We start 1943 under conditions I would never have dared to hope. Russia has held, Egypt for the present is safe. There is a hope of clearing North Africa of Germans in the near future... Russia is scoring wonderful successes in Southern Russia.&lt;ref&gt;P.M.H. Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, p 107.&lt;/ref&gt;
At that point, the British had won the [[Battle of El Alamein]] in November 1942. However, there were only about 50,000 German soldiers at El Alamein in Egypt, while at Stalingrad 200,000 Germans had been lost.&lt;ref&gt;P.M.H. Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, p 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the strategic implications, there is little doubt that Stalingrad was a watershed in terms of morale. Germany's defeat shattered its reputation for invincibility. It dealt a devastating blow to German morale. On 30 January 1943, the tenth anniversary of his coming to power, Hitler chose not to speak. [[Josef Goebbels]] read the text of his speech for him on the radio. The speech contained an oblique reference to the battle, which suggested that Germany was now in a defensive war. The public mood was sullen, depressed, fearful, and war-weary. Germany was looking in the face of defeat.&lt;ref&gt;P.M.H. Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, pp 104-105, 107.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The reverse was the case on the Soviet side. There was a overwhelming surge in confidence and belief in victory. A common saying was: &quot;You cannot stop an army which has done Stalingrad.&quot; Stalin was feted as the hero of the hour and made a [[Marshal of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;P.M.H. Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, p 106&lt;/ref&gt; In recognition of the determination of its defenders, Stalingrad was awarded the title [[Hero City]] in 1945. In 1967, a colossal monument, [[The Motherland Calls]], was erected on the [[Mamayev Kurgan]], the hill overlooking the city where bones and rusty metal splinters can still be found.&lt;ref&gt;Historical Memorial Complex &quot;To the Heroes of the Stalingrad Battle&quot; at Mamayev Hill. [http://mamayevhill.volgadmin.ru/00_n.htm Official web site]. Retrieved 17 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The statue forms part of a war memorial complex which includes the ruins of the Grain Silo and [[Pavlov's House]].

The news of the battle echoed round the world, with many people now believing that Hitler's defeat was inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Roberts, ''Stalin's Wars: From World War to Cold War, 1939–1953'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2006, pp 154–155.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Turkish Consul in Moscow predicted that &quot;the lands which the Germans have destined for their [[lebensraum|living space]] will become their dying space&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;P.M.H. Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, p 95&lt;/ref&gt; Britain's conservative [[Daily Telegraph]] proclaimed that the victory had saved European civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;P.M.H. Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, p 95&lt;/ref&gt; The country celebrated &quot;Red Army Day&quot; on 23 February 1943. A ceremonial [[Sword of Stalingrad]] was forged by King George VI. After being put on public display in Britain, this was presented to Stalin by Winston Churchill at the [[Tehran conference]] later in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;P.M.H. Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, p 106&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet propaganda spared no effort and wasted no time in capitalising on the triumph, impressing a global audience. The prestige of Stalin, the Soviet Union, and the worldwide Communist movement was immense, and their political position greatly enhanced.&lt;ref&gt;P.M.H. Bell, ''Twelve Turning Points of the Second World War'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 2011, p 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the defence of Stalingrad, the Red Army deployed six armies ([[8th Army (Soviet Union)|8th]], [[28th Army (Soviet Union)|28th]], [[51st Army (Soviet Union)|51st]], [[57th Army (Soviet Union)|57th]], [[62nd Army (Soviet Union)|62nd]] and [[64th Army (Soviet Union)|64th Armies]]) in and around the city and an additional nine armies in the encirclement counter offensive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beevor1998&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|435–438|date=June 2011}} The nine armies amassed for the counteroffensive were the [[24th Army (Soviet Union)|24th Army]], [[65th Army]], [[66th Army]] and [[16th Air Army]] from the north as part of the [[Don Front]] offensive and [[1st Guards Tank Army (Soviet Union)|1st Guards Army]], [[5th Guards Tank Army|5th Tank]], [[21st Army (Soviet Union)|21st Army]], [[2nd Air Army]] and [[17th Air Army]] from the south as part of the [[Soviet Southwestern Front|Southwestern Front]].

;Axis
{{Main|Axis order of battle at the Battle of Stalingrad}}

===Casualties===

The calculation of casualties depends on what scope is given to the battle of Stalingrad. The scope can vary from just the fighting within the city and suburbs itself to the inclusion of almost all fighting on the southern wing of the Soviet-German front from the spring of 1942 to the end of the fighting in the city in the winter of 1943. Different scholars have produced different estimates depending on their definition of the scope of the battle. The difference is comparing the city against the region.

The Axis suffered 850,000 total casualties (wounded, killed, captured) among all branches of the German armed forces and its allies; 400,000 Germans, 200,000 Romanians, 130,000 Italians, and 120,000 Hungarians were killed, wounded or captured.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, William (1973). ''Enemy at the Gates: the Battle for Stalingrad''. New York: Penguin Books (ISBN 0-14-200000-0 &amp; ISBN 1-56852-368-8).&lt;/ref&gt;

On the material side, the Germans losses were 900 aircraft (including 274 transports and 165 bombers used as transports), 500 tanks, and 6,000 artillery pieces.&lt;ref name=Bergstrom2007/&gt;{{Rp|122–123|date=May 2009}} According to a contemporary Soviet report, 5,762 artillery pieces; 1,312 mortars; 12,701 heavy machine guns; 156,987 rifles; 80,438 sub-machine guns; 10,722 trucks; 744 aircraft; 1,666 tanks; 261 other armored vehicles; 571 half-tracks; and 10,679 motorcycles were captured by the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://militera.lib.ru/h/isaev_av8/21.html|title=Эпилог. Операция «Кольцо»|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unknown amount of Hungarian, Italian, and Romanian material was lost.

The USSR, according to archival figures, suffered 1,129,619 total casualties;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.hrono.info/sobyt/1900sob/1942stal.html Сталинградская битва] {{ru icon}}. Retrieved 4 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 478,741 personnel killed or missing, and 650,878 wounded or sick. On the material side for the USSR lost 4,341 tanks destroyed or damaged, 15,728 artillery pieces, and 2,769 combat aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Гриф секретности снят: Потери Вооружённых Сил СССР в войнах, боевых действиях и военных конфликтах: Стат. исслед. / Г.

Anywhere from 25,000 to 40,000 Soviet civilians died in Stalingrad and its suburbs during a single week of aerial bombing by ''Luftflotte'' 4 as the German 4th Panzer and 6th Armies approached the city;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Roberts (2002). [http://books.google.com/books?id=OWOQAv01lYEC ''Victory at Stalingrad: the battle that changed history'']. Pearson Education. p.77. ISBN 0-582-77185-4&lt;/ref&gt; The total number of civilians killed in Stalingrad is unknown.

In all, the battle resulted in an estimated total of 1.7–2 million Axis and Soviet casualties.

====Luftwaffe losses====
Aircraft losses of the Luftwaffe for the supply of the 6th Army at Stalingrad, and the recovery of wounded from 24 November 1942 to 31 January 1943:

These losses amounted to about 50% of total aircraft committed. In addition, the Luftwaffe training program was stopped and sorties in other theaters of war were significantly reduced to save fuel for use at Stalingrad.

===In popular culture===
{{Main|Battle of Stalingrad in popular culture}}

The events of the battle for Stalingrad have been covered in several films of [[Stalingrad (film)|German]], Russian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4562967572164209056&amp;q=duration%3Along+is%3Afree+genre%3AMOVIE_FEATURE|title=The Great Battle on the Volga (1962)|publisher=Video.google.com |date=|accessdate=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enemy at the Gates|British, and American]] origin.

The struggle is also remembered and reflected upon in numerous books, for its significance as a turning point in the Second World War and for the loss of life associated with the battle.

In the 2011 video game [[Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad]], the single player campaign focuses on the Battle of Stalingrad, and several maps in the game portray famous locations of the battle, such as [[Pavlov's House]], the Red October Factory and Mamayev Kurgan, among others. The Multiplayer also consisted of several famous locations from the single player so people could experience for themselves what it was like, to an extent.

The 2013 game, [[Company of Heroes 2]], portrayed the battle in certain missions, but was heavily criticized by some Russian players for &quot;being historically inaccurate&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polygon.com/2013/7/25/4553536/is-company-of-heroes-2-anti-russian Why gaming's latest take on war is so offensive to Russians]. Polygon (2013-07-25). Retrieved on 2013-09-18.&lt;/ref&gt; and on 7 August DVD sales of the Russian version of the game were halted in Russia, while the game is still available for downloading from Steam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcgamesn.com/companyofheroes/company-heroes-2-sales-stopped-russia Company of Heroes 2 sales stopped in Russia].
