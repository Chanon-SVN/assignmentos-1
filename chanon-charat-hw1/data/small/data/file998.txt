'''Apus''' is a faint [[constellation]] in the southern sky, first defined in the late 16th century. Its name means &quot;no feet&quot; in [[Greek language|Greek]], and it represents a [[bird-of-paradise]] (which were once believed to lack feet). It is bordered by [[Triangulum Australe]], [[Circinus]], [[Musca]], [[Chamaeleon]], [[Octans]], [[Pavo (constellation)|Pavo]] and [[Ara (constellation)|Ara]]. Its [[genitive]] is &quot;Apodis&quot;.

==History==
Apus was one of twelve constellations created by [[Petrus Plancius]] from the observations of [[Pieter Dirkszoon Keyser]] and [[Frederick de Houtman]].  It first appeared on a 35&amp;nbsp;cm diameter celestial globe published in 1597 or 1598 in Amsterdam by Plancius with [[Jodocus Hondius]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Ridpath|2001|pp=76-77}}&lt;ref name=&quot;UT&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.universetoday.com/19562/apus/ |title = Apus |last = Plotner |first = Tammy |publisher = Universe Today |date = 13 October 2008 |accessdate = 22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Plancius called the constellation ''Paradysvogel Apis Indica''; the first word is [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for &quot;bird of paradise&quot;, of genus [[Pteridophora]], but the others are [[Latin]] for &quot;Indian Bee&quot;. ''Apis'' (Latin for &quot;bee&quot;) is presumably an error for ''avis'' (&quot;bird&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/apus.htm |title = Apus |last = Ridpath |first = Ian |work = Star Tales |accessdate = 10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UT&quot;/&gt;

The name ''Apus'' is derived from the Greek ''apous'', meaning &quot;without feet&quot;.  This referred to the Western misconception that the bird-of-paradise had no feet, which arose because the only specimens available in the West had their feet and wings removed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt; Such specimens began to arrive in Europe in 1522, when the survivors of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s expedition brought them home.{{sfn|Staal|1988|p=252}}

After its introduction on Plancius's globe, the constellation's first known appearance in a celestial atlas was in [[Johann Bayer]]'s ''[[Uranometria]]'' of 1603, where it was called &quot;Apis Indica&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ridpath&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UT&quot;/&gt;

Richard Allen reports Semler's assertion that de Houtman, who observed the southern constellations from the island of Sumatra, took his ideas for the formation of Apus (as well as [[Phoenix (constellation)|Phoenix]] and [[Indus_(constellation)|Indus]]) from the Chinese, who knew the stars of Apus as the &quot;Little Wonder Bird&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Allen (1899) Star Names: Their Lore and Meaning, p. 45 &lt;http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Topics/astronomy/_Texts/secondary/ALLSTA/Apus*.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and that Semler's assertion was disputed by Ideler (though Ideler acknowledged the Chinese constellations).

== Notable features ==

When the [[Ming Dynasty]] Chinese astronomer [[Xu Guangqi]] adapted the European southern hemisphere constellations to the Chinese system in ''[[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms|The Southern Asterisms]]'', he combined Apus with some of the stars in [[Octans]] to form the &quot;[[Chinese constellations#The Southern Asterisms|Exotic Bird]]&quot; (異雀, ''Yìquè'').&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}} [http://aeea.nmns.edu.tw/2006/0607/ap060729.html AEEA (Activities of Exhibition and Education in Astronomy) 天文教育資訊網 2006 年 7 月 29 日]&lt;/ref&gt;
