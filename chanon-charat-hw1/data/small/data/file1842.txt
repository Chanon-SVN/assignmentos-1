'''ANSI C''', also known as '''C89''' and '''C90''' depending on the year of ratification, refers to the family of successive standards published by the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) for the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]]. Software developers writing in C are encouraged to conform to the standards, as doing so aids [[porting|portability]] between compilers.

==History and outlook==

The first standard for C was published by ANSI. Although this document was subsequently adopted by [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and subsequent revisions published by ISO have been adopted by ANSI, the name ANSI C (rather than ISO C) is still more widely used. While some software developers use the term '''ISO C''', others are standards bodyâ€“neutral and use '''Standard C'''.

===C89===
In 1983, the American National Standards Institute formed a committee, X3J11, to establish a standard specification of C. After a long and arduous process{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}, the standard was completed in 1989 and ratified as ANSI X3.159-1989 &quot;Programming Language C.&quot; This version of the language is often referred to as &quot;ANSI C&quot;. Later on sometimes the label &quot;C89&quot; is used to distinguish it from C99 but using the same labelling method.

===C90===
The same standard as C89 was ratified by the International Organization for Standardization as ISO/IEC 9899:1990, with only formatting changes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Standards.html|title=Standards - Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)|accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is sometimes referred to as C90. Therefore, the terms &quot;C89&quot; and &quot;C90&quot; refer to essentially the same language.

This standard has been withdrawn by both INCITS&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1&quot; /&gt; and ISO/IEC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=17782|title=ISO/IEC 9899:1990 - Programming Languages -- C|accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===C95===
In 1995 the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] published an extension, called Amendment&amp;nbsp;1, for the ANSI-C standard. Its full name finally was ''ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995'' or nicknamed ''C95''. Aside to error correction there were further changes to the language capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.lysator.liu.se/c/na1.html | title=A brief description of Normative Addendum 1 | author=Clive D.W. Feather | date=2010-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Most important additions to C95====
* Improvements to the support for ''multi byte'' and ''wide character'' char sets in the standard library.
* Addition of [[Digraph (computing)#C|Digraphs]] to the language.
* Specification of standard macros for the alternative specification of operators, e.g. &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;.
* Specification of the standard macro &lt;code&gt;__STDC_VERSION__&lt;/code&gt;.

====Preprocessor Test for C95 compatibility====
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#if defined(__STDC_VERSION__) &amp;&amp; __STDC_VERSION__ &gt;= 199409L
/*
 * C95 compatible source code.
 */
#endif
&lt;/source&gt;

===C99===
{{Main|C99}}
In March 2000, ANSI adopted the ISO/IEC 9899:1999 standard. This standard is commonly referred to as C99.

This standard has been withdrawn by ISO/IEC in favour of C11,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=29237|title=ISO/IEC 9899:1999 - Programming Languages -- C|accessdate=2012-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is still approved by INCITS.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===C11===
{{Main|C11_(C_standard_revision)|l1=C11}}
&quot;C11&quot; is the new [[Open standard|standard]] for the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]].

==Support from major compilers==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}
ANSI C is now supported by almost all the widely used compilers. Most of the C code being written nowadays is based on ANSI C. Any program written ''only'' in standard C and without any hardware dependent assumptions is virtually guaranteed to compile correctly on any [[system platform|platform]] with a conforming C implementation.  Without such precautions, most programs may compile only on a certain platform or with a particular compiler, due, for example, to the use of non-standard libraries, such as [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] libraries, or to the reliance on compiler- or platform-specific attributes such as the exact size of certain data types and byte [[endianness]].

===Compliance detectability===
To mitigate the differences between [[K&amp;R C]] and the ANSI C standard, the &lt;code&gt;__STDC__&lt;/code&gt; (&quot;standard c&quot;) macro can be used to split code into ANSI and K&amp;R sections.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 #if __STDC__
 extern int getopt(int, char * const *, const char *);
 #else
 extern int getopt();
 #endif
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

It's better to use &quot;&lt;code&gt;#if __STDC__&lt;/code&gt;&quot; as above rather than &quot;&lt;code&gt;#ifdef __STDC__&lt;/code&gt;&quot; because some implementation may set &lt;code&gt;__STDC__&lt;/code&gt; to zero to indicate non-ANSI compliance. &quot;&lt;code&gt;#if&lt;/code&gt;&quot; will treat any identifiers that couldn't be replaced by a macro as zero (&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;). Thus even if the macro &quot;&lt;code&gt;__STDC__&lt;/code&gt;&quot; is not defined to signify non-ANSI compliance, &quot;&lt;code&gt;#if&lt;/code&gt;&quot; will work as shown.

In the above example, a prototype is used in a function declaration for ANSI compliant implementations, while an obsolescent non-prototype declaration is used otherwise. Those are still ANSI-compliant as of C99
