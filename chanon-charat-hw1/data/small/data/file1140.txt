The '''Ark of the Covenant''' ({{lang-he|אָרוֹן הַבְּרִית}} ''ʾĀrôn Habbərî&lt;u&gt;t&lt;/u&gt;'', modern pron. ''Aron haBrit''), also known as the '''Ark of the Testimony''', is a chest described in the [[Book of Exodus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref|Exodus|25:10-22|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; as containing the [[Tablets of Stone]] on which the [[Ten Commandments]] were inscribed. According to the New Testament [[Letter to the Hebrews]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Hebrews|9:4|NIV|}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Ark also contained [[Aaron's rod]], a jar of [[manna]], and the first [[Torah scroll]] as [[Mosaic authorship|written by Moses]]; however, the first of the [[Books of Kings]] says that at the time of King [[Solomon]], the Ark contained only the two [[Tablets of the Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|1|Kings|8:9|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Book of Exodus, the Ark was built at the command of [[God]], in accordance with the instructions given to [[Moses]] on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|25:10-16|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; God was said to have communicated with Moses &quot;from between the two [[cherub]]im&quot; on the Ark's cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|25:22|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biblical account relates that about a year after the Israelites' [[The Exodus|exodus from Egypt]], the Ark was created according to the pattern given to Moses by God when Israel was encamped at the foot of Mount Sinai. Thereafter the gold-plated acacia chest was carried by the [[Levite]]s some 2,000 [[cubit]]s in advance of the people when on the march or before the Israelite army, the host of fighting men.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Numbers|4:5-6|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Ark was borne by Levites into the bed of the [[Jordan River]], the waters parted as God had parted the waters of the Red Sea, opening a pathway for the entire host to pass through (Josh. 3:15–16; 4:7–18). The walls of the city of [[Jericho]] were shaken to the ground with no more than a shout from the army after the Ark of the Covenant was paraded round them for seven days by Levites accompanied by seven priests sounding seven trumpets of [[shofar|rams' horns]] (Josh. 6:4–20). When carried, the Ark was always hidden under a large veil made of skins and blue cloth, always carefully concealed, even from the eyes of the [[Kohen|priests]] and the Levites who carried it. There are no contemporary extra-biblical references to the Ark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cline |first=Eric H. |title=From Eden to Exile: Unraveling Mysteries of the Bible |publisher=National Geographic |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4262-0084-7 |page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses of the term==
In the [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Christian church|churches]], the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] is sometimes allegorically referred to as the Ark of the Covenant, in that she bore [[Jesus Christ]] in similarity to the original tangible contents of the Ark, as cited in the [[Book of Revelation]] and (in Roman Catholicism) the [[Litany of Loreto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.catholic.com/magazine/articles/mary-the-ark-of-the-new-covenant |first=Steve |last=Ray |title=Mary, the Ark of the New Covenant |journal=[[Catholic Answers|Catholic Answers Magazine]] |date=May 2009 |volume=20 |issue=5 |accessdate=2013-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://theorthodoxfaith.com/mary-as-the-new-ark-of-the-covenant/ Mary as the New Ark of the Covenant]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction and description===
According to the [[Book of Exodus]], [[Yahweh]] instructed [[Moses]] on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] during his 40-day stay upon the mountain within the thick cloud and darkness where God was (Ex. 19:20; 24:18) and he was shown the pattern for the tabernacle and furnishings of the Ark to be made of [[shittim wood]] to house the [[Tablets of Stone]]. Moses instructed [[Bezalel]] and [[Oholiab]] to construct the ark (Exodus 31).&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Ponessa, Laurie Watson Manhardt, ''Moses and The Torah: Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy'', pages 85-86 (Emmaus Road Publishing, 2007). ISBN 978-1-931018-45-6&lt;/ref&gt;  In Deuteronomy, however, the ark is said to have been built specifically by Moses himself without reference of Bezalel or Oholiab.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=deu+10%3A1-5&amp;version=NIV&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Book of Exodus gives detailed instructions on how the Ark is to be constructed. It is to be 2½ [[cubit]]s in length, 1½ in breadth, and 1½ in height (approximately {{convert|131|*|79|*|79|cm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}). Then it is to be plated entirely with [[gold]], and a crown or molding of gold is to be put around it. Four rings of gold are to be attached to its four feet—two on each side—and through these rings staves of shittim-wood overlaid with gold for carrying the Ark are to be inserted; and these are not to be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblestudytools.com/exodus/25-12-compare.html |title=&quot;Four feet&quot;; see Exodus 25:12, majority of translations. &quot;Four corners&quot; in KJV |publisher=Biblestudytools.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A golden cover, a ''[[Mercy Seat|kapporet]]'' (traditionally &quot;Mercy Seat&quot; in Christian translations) adorned with golden [[cherub]]im, is to be placed above the Ark. The Ark is finally to be placed behind a veil (''[[Parochet]]''), a full description of which is also given at {{bibleverse||Exodus|25|131}}.

After its creation by Moses, the Ark was carried by the [[Israelites]] during their 40 years of wandering in the desert. Whenever the Israelites camped, the Ark was placed in a special and sacred [[tent]], called the [[Tabernacle]].

When the Israelites, led by [[Joshua]] toward the [[Promised Land]], arrived at the banks of the [[River Jordan]], the Ark was carried in the lead preceding the people and was the signal for their advance (Joshua 3:3, 6). During the crossing, the river grew dry as soon as the feet of the priests carrying the Ark touched its waters, and remained so until the priests—with the Ark—left the river after the people had passed over (Josh. 3:15-17; 4:10, 11, 18). As memorials, [[Twelve Stones|twelve stones]] were taken from the Jordan at the place where the priests had stood (Josh. 4:1-9).

In the [[Battle of Jericho]], the Ark was carried round the city once a day for seven days, preceded by the armed men and seven priests sounding seven trumpets of rams' horns (Josh. 6:4-15). On the seventh day, the seven priests sounding the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the Ark compassed the city seven times and, with a great shout, Jericho's wall fell down flat and the people took the city (Josh. 6:16-20). After the defeat at [[Ai (Bible)|Ai]], Joshua lamented before the Ark (Josh. 7:6-9). When Joshua read the Law to the people between [[Mount Gerizim]] and [[Mount Ebal]], they stood on each side of the Ark. The Ark was again set up by Joshua at [[Shiloh (Biblical)|Shiloh]], but when the Israelites fought against Benjamin at [[Gibeah]], they had the Ark with them and consulted it after their defeat.

===Capture by the Philistines===
[[File:Figures The erection of the Tabernacle and the Sacred vessels.jpg|thumb|1728 illustration of the Ark at the erection of the Tabernacle and the sacred vessels, as in Exodus 40:17-19]]
{{Main|Philistine captivity of the Ark}}
The Ark is next spoken of as being in the Tabernacle at [[Shiloh (Biblical city)|Shiloh]] during Samuel's [[apprenticeship]] (1 Sam. 3:3). After the settlement of the Israelites in [[Canaan]], the Ark remained in the Tabernacle at [[Gilgal]] for a season before being removed to Shiloh until the time of [[Eli (Judges)|Eli]], between 300 and 400 years ([[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]] 7:12), when it was carried into the field of battle, so as to secure, as they had hoped, victory to the Hebrews. The Ark was taken by the [[Philistines]] (1 Sam. 4:3-11) who subsequently sent it back after retaining it for seven months (1 Sam. 5:7, 8) because of the events said to have transpired.

After their first defeat at [[Eben-ezer]], the Israelites had the Ark brought from Shiloh, and welcomed its coming with great rejoicing. In the second battle, the Israelites were again defeated, and the Philistines captured the Ark (1 Sam. 4:3-5, 10, 11). The news of its capture was at once taken to Shiloh by a messenger &quot;with his clothes rent, and with earth upon his head.&quot; The old priest, Eli, fell dead when he heard it; and his daughter-in-law, bearing a son at the time the news of the capture of the Ark was received, named him [[Ichabod]]—explained as &quot;The glory has departed Israel&quot; in reference to the loss of the Ark (1 Sam. 4:12-22).

The Philistines took the Ark to several places in their country, and at each place misfortune befell them (1 Sam. 5:1-6). At [[Ashdod]] it was placed in the temple of [[Dagon]]. The next morning Dagon was found prostrate, bowed down, before it; and on being restored to his place, he was on the following morning again found prostrate and broken. The people of Ashdod were smitten with [[hemorrhoids]]; a plague of mice was sent over the land (1 Sam. 6:5). The affliction of boils was also visited upon the people of [[Gath (city)|Gath]] and of [[Ekron]], whither the Ark was successively removed (1 Sam. 5:8-12).

After the Ark had been among them for seven months, the Philistines, on the advice of their diviners, returned it to the Israelites, accompanying its return with an offering consisting of golden images of the tumors and mice where with they had been afflicted. The Ark was set in the field of Joshua the [[Beth-shemesh|Beth-shemite]], and the Beth-shemites offered sacrifices and burnt offerings (1 Sam. 6:1-15). Out of curiosity the men of [[Beth-shemesh]] gazed at the Ark; and as a punishment, seventy of them (fifty thousand and seventy in some mss.) were smitten by the Lord (1 Sam. 6:19). The Bethshemites sent to [[Kirjath-jearim]], or Baal-Judah, to have the Ark removed (1 Sam. 6:21); and it was taken to the house of [[Abinadab]], whose son [[Eleazar (son of Aminadab)|Eleazar]] was sanctified to keep it. Kirjath-jearim remained the abode of the Ark for twenty years. Under Saul, the Ark was with the army before he first met the Philistines, but the king was too impatient to consult it before engaging in battle. In [[Books of Chronicles|1 Chronicles]] 13:3 it is stated that the people were not accustomed to consult the Ark in the days of [[Saul]].

===In the days of King David===
[[File:Morgan-bible-fl-39.jpg|thumb|left|290px|Illustration from the 13th century [[Morgan Bible]] of David bringing the Ark into Jerusalem (2 Samuel 6).]]
At the beginning of his reign, King [[David]] removed the Ark from [[Kirjath-jearim]] amid great rejoicing. On the way to [[Zion]], [[Uzzah]], one of the drivers of the cart that the Ark was carried on, put out his hand to steady the Ark, and was struck dead by God for touching it. David, in fear, carried the Ark aside into the house of [[Obed-edom]] the [[Gath (city)|Gittite]], instead of carrying it on to Zion, and there it stayed three months (2 Samuel 6:1-11; 1 Chronicles 13:1-13).

On hearing that God had blessed Obed-edom because of the presence of the Ark in his house, David had the Ark brought to Zion by the Levites, while he himself, &quot;girded with a linen [[ephod]],&quot; &quot;danced before the Lord with all his might&quot; and in the sight of all the public gathered in Jerusalem—a performance that caused him to be scornfully rebuked by his first wife, Saul's daughter [[Michal]] (2 Sam. 6:12-16, 20-22; 1 Chron. 15). In Zion, David put the Ark in the tabernacle he had prepared for it, offered sacrifices, distributed food, and blessed the people and his own household (2 Sam. 6:17-20; 1 Chron. 16:1-3; 2 Chron. 1:4).

The Levites were appointed to minister before the Ark (1 Chron. 16:4). David's plan of building a temple for the Ark was stopped at the advice of God (2 Sam. 7:1-17; 1 Chron. 17:1-15; 28:2, 3). The Ark was with the army during the siege of [[Rabbah]] (2 Sam. 11:11); and when David fled from Jerusalem at the time of [[Absalom]]'s conspiracy, the Ark was carried along with him until he ordered [[Zadok (High Priest)|Zadok]] the priest to return it to Jerusalem (2 Sam. 15:24-29).

===In Solomon's Temple===
[[File:Folio 29r - The Ark of God Carried into the Temple.jpg|thumb|The Ark carried into the Temple from the early 15th century ''[[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]'']]
When [[Abiathar]] was dismissed from the priesthood by King [[Solomon]] for having taken part in [[Adonijah]]'s [[conspiracy (political)|conspiracy]] against David, his life was spared because he had formerly borne the Ark (1 Kings 2:26). Solomon worshipped before the Ark after his dream in which God promised him wisdom (1 Kings 3:15).

During the construction of [[Solomon's Temple]], a special inner room, named ''[[Kodesh Hakodashim]]'' (Eng. [[Holy of Holies]]), was prepared to receive and house the Ark (1 Kings 6:19); and when the Temple was dedicated, the Ark—containing the original [[Tablets of Stone|tablets]] of the [[Ten Commandments]]—was placed therein (1 Kings 8:6-9). When the priests emerged from the holy place after placing the Ark there, the Temple was filled with a cloud, &quot;for the glory of the Lord had filled the house of the Lord&quot; (1 Kings 8:10-11; 2 Chron. 5:13, 14).

When Solomon married Pharaoh's daughter, he caused her to dwell in a house outside [[Zion]], as Zion was consecrated because of its containing the Ark (2 Chron. 8:11). King Josiah also had the Ark put in the Temple (2 Chron. 35:3), from which it appears to have been removed by one of his predecessors (cf. 2 Chron. 33-34 and 2 Kings 21-23).

===The Babylonian Conquest and aftermath===
In 587 BC, the [[Babylonia]]ns [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|destroyed Jerusalem]] and Solomon's Temple. There is no record of what became of the Ark in the Books of Kings and Chronicles. But the Greek 3rd Book of Ezra (1 Esdras) suggests that Babylonians took away the vessels of the ark of God (but does not mention taking away The Ark itself):

&lt;blockquote&gt; And they took all the holy vessels of the Lord, both great and small, with the vessels of the ark of God, and the king's treasures, and carried them away into Babylon.
:—1 Esdras 1:54&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Rabbinic Literature]], the final disposition of the Ark is disputed. Some rabbis hold that it must have been carried off to Babylon, while others hold that it must have been hidden lest it be carried off into Babylon and never brought back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ark of the Covenant |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1777-ark-of-the-covenant#anchor10 |work=Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate=1 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A late 2nd century rabbinic work known as the ''[[Tosefta]]'' states the opinions of these rabbis that [[Josiah]], the king of Judah, stored away the Ark, along with the jar of [[manna]], and a jar containing the holy anointing oil, the rod of Aaron which budded and a chest given to Israel by the Philistines.&lt;ref&gt;Tosefta (''Sotah'' 13:1); cf. [[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Kereithot'' 5b)&lt;/ref&gt; This was said to have been done in order to prevent their being carried off into Babylon as had already happened to the other vessels. Rabbi Eliezer and Rabbi Shimon, in the same rabbinic work, purport that the Ark was, in fact, taken into Babylon. Rabbi Yehudah, dissenting, says that the Ark was stored away in its own place, meaning, somewhere on the Temple Mount.

==References in Scripture==

===Tanakh===

The Ark is first mentioned in the [[Book of Exodus]], and then numerous times in [[Deuteronomy]], [[Book of Joshua|Joshua]], [[Book of Judges|Judges]], [[I Samuel]], [[II Samuel]], [[I Kings]], [[I Chronicles]], [[II Chronicles]], [[Psalms]] and [[Book of Jeremiah|Jeremiah]].

In the [[Book of Jeremiah]], it is referenced by [[Jeremiah (prophet)|Jeremiah]], who, speaking in the days of [[Josiah]] (Jer. 3:16), prophesied a future time, possibly the [[Jewish eschatology|end of days]], when the Ark will no longer be talked about or be made again:

{{quote|And it shall be that when you multiply and become fruitful in the land, in those days - the word of the LORD - they will no longer say, 'The Ark of the Covenant of the LORD' and it will not come to mind; they will not mention it, and will not recall it, and it will not be used any more.}}

[[Rashi]] comments on this verse that &quot;The entire people will be so imbued with the spirit of sanctity that God's Presence will rest upon them collectively, as if the congregation itself was the Ark of the Covenant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Jeremiah 3:16, Tanach|publisher=ArtScroll|location=Brooklyn, New York|page=1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Book of Maccabees===
{{See also|2 Maccabees}}
According to the Jewish [[Deuterocanonical books|Deuterocanonical book]] [[Second Maccabees]], the Greek text in the [[Septuagint]], at the beginning of chapter 2:

{{quote|1=The records show that it was the prophet Jeremiah who ... prompted by a divine message ... gave orders that the Tent of Meeting and the ark should go with him.  Then he went away to the mountain from the top of which Moses saw God's promised land.  When he reached the mountain, Jeremiah found a cave-dwelling; he carried the tent, the ark, and the incense-altar into it, then blocked up the entrance.  Some of his companions came to mark out the way, but were unable to find it.  When Jeremiah learnt of this he reprimanded them. &quot;The place shall remain unknown&quot;, he said, &quot;until God finally gathers his people together and shows mercy to them. The Lord will bring these things to light again, and the glory of the Lord will appear with the cloud, as it was seen both in the time of Moses and when Solomon prayed that the shrine might be worthily consecrated.&quot;

The &quot;mountain from the top of which Moses saw God's promised land&quot; would be [[Mount Nebo]], located in what is now [[Jordan]].

===New Testament===
{{unreliable sources|section|date=January 2014}}
[[File:Cathédrale d'Auch 20.jpg|thumb|right|Carrying the Ark of the Covenant: gilded bas-relief at the [[Auch Cathedral]]]]

In the [[New Testament]], the Ark is mentioned in the [[Letter to the Hebrews]] and the [[Book of Revelation|Revelation to St. John]]. {{bibleverse||Hebrews|9:4|NIV}} states that the Ark contained &quot;the golden pot that had [[manna]], and [[Aaron's rod]] that budded, and the tablets of the covenant.&quot; {{bibleverse||Revelation|11:19|NIV}} says the prophet saw God's temple in heaven opened, &quot;and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple.&quot;

A number of [[Roman Catholic]] writers connect this verse with the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]] in {{bibleverse||Revelation|12:1|NIV}}, which immediately follows, and argue that the [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] is the &quot;Ark of the New Covenant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ray|first=Steve|title=Mary, the Ark of the New Covenant|journal=[[This Rock]]|date=October 2005|volume=16|issue=8|url=http://www.catholic.com/thisrock/2005/0510fea5.asp|accessdate=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Michael Lindsey, ''The Woman and The Dragon: Apparitions of Mary'', page 21 (Pelican Publishing Company, Inc., 2000) ISBN 1-56554-731-4&lt;/ref&gt; Carrying the saviour of mankind within her, she herself became the [[Holy of Holies]].

ISBN 0-85244-582-2&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also believed by Roman Catholics that [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]] the bishop of Alexandria wrote about the connections between the Ark and the Virgin Mary: &quot;O noble Virgin, truly you are greater than any other greatness. For who is your equal in greatness, O dwelling place of God the Word? To whom among all creatures shall I compare you, O Virgin? You are greater than them all O (Ark of the) Covenant, clothed with purity instead of gold! You are the Ark in which is found the golden vessel containing the true manna, that is, the flesh in which Divinity resides&quot; (''Homily of the Papyrus of Turin'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maryimmaculate.tripod.com/marian2.html |title=The Ark of the New Covenant |publisher=Maryimmaculate.tripod.com |date=1998-11-24 |accessdate=2012-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some question the authenticity of this work and suggest it is an example of the writing of yet another Pseudo-Athanasius.&lt;ref&gt;http://turretinfan.blogspot.com.es/2008/05/athanasius-homily-of-papyrus-of-turin.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qur'an===
In chapter 2 (''Sura'' 2) of the Islamic Qur'an (Verse 248), the Children of Israel, at the time of [[Samuel]] and [[Saul]], were given back the ''Tabut E Sakina'' (the casket of [[Shekhinah]]) which contained remnants of the household of [[Islamic view of Moses|Musa]] (Moses) and [[Islamic view of Aaron|Harun]] (Aaron) carried by angels which confirmed peace and reassurance for them from their Lord. The [[Qur'an]] states:
{{quote|And (further) their Prophet said to them: &quot;A Sign of his authority is that there shall come to you the Ark of the Covenant, with (an assurance) therein of security (''[[Sakina]]'') from your Lord, and the relics left by the family of Moses and the family of Aaron, carried by angels. In this is a symbol for you if ye indeed have faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|248|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Islamic scholar [[Baidawi|Al Baidawi]] mentioned that the ''sakina'' could be [[Tawrat]], the Books of Moses.&lt;ref name=&quot;dict&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=JherW50tVyAC&amp;pg=PA624&amp;dq=ark+of+the+covenant+islam |title=A Dictionary of Islam By Patrick Hughes, Thomas Patrick Hughes, pg 624|publisher=Books.google.com|date=1995-12-01|accessdate=2010-03-07|isbn= 978-81-206-0672-2|author1=Hughes, Thomas Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Al-Jalalan, the relics in the Ark were the fragments of the two tablets, rods, robes, shoes, mitres of Moses and the vase of manna.&lt;ref name=&quot;dict&quot;/&gt; Al-Tha'alibi, in ''[[Qisas Al-Anbiya]]'' (The Stories of the Prophets), has given an earlier and later history of the Ark.

According to most Muslim scholars, the Ark of the Covenant has a religious basis in Islam, and Islam gives it special significance. A Shia sect of Muslims believe that it will be found by [[Mahdi]] near the [[Qiyamah|end of times]] from [[Lake Tiberias]].&lt;ref&gt;Iqd al-Durar fi Akbar al-Imam al-Muntadhar, by Shaikh Jamaluddin Yusuf al Damishqi, p. 51-a&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible locations==
Since its disappearance from the Biblical narrative, there have been a number of claims of having discovered or of having possession of the Ark, and several possible places have been suggested for its location.

===Mount Nebo===
[[2 Maccabees]] 2:4-10, written around 100 BC, says that the prophet [[Jeremiah]], &quot;being warned by God&quot; before the [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|Babylonian invasion]], took the Ark, the Tabernacle, and the Altar of Incense, and buried them in a cave on [[Mount Nebo]], informing those of his followers who wished to find the place that it should remain unknown &quot;until the time that God should gather His people again together, and receive them unto mercy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://bibref.hebtools.com/bibref.php?book=Deuteronomy&amp;verse=34%3A1-3&amp;src=1000 Deuteronomy 34:1-3] and [http://bibref.hebtools.com/bibref.php?book=2Maccabees&amp;verse=2%3A4-8&amp;src=1000 2 Maccabees 2:4-8].&lt;/ref&gt;  
Mount Nebo is also described in the Bible (Deuteronomy 34) as the site from which Moses views the [[Promised Land]], and apparently also is his final burial place. Mount Nebo is approximately 29 miles (47&amp;nbsp;km) slightly south of due east from Jerusalem, near the east bank of the Jordan River.

===Ethiopia===
[[File:Ark of the Covenant church in Axum Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|right|The Chapel of the Tablet at the [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]] in [[Axum]] allegedly houses the original Ark of the Covenant.]]

The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church]] claims to possess the Ark of the Covenant, or ''[[Tabot]]'', in [[Axum, Ethiopia|Axum]]. The object is currently kept under guard in a treasury near the [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]]. Replicas of the Axum ''tabot'' are kept in every Ethiopian church, each with its own dedication to a particular saint; the most popular of these include Mary, George and Michael.&lt;ref name=munro-hay&gt;Stuart Munro-Hay, 2005, ''The Quest for the Ark of the Covenant'', Tauris (reviewed in ''Times Literary Supplement'' 19 August 2005 p. 36)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Kebra Nagast]]'', composed to legitimise the [[Solomonic dynasty|new dynasty]] ruling [[Ethiopia]] following its establishment in 1270, narrates how the real Ark of the Covenant was brought to Ethiopia by [[Menelik I]] with divine assistance, while a forgery was left in the Temple in Jerusalem. Although the ''Kebra Nagast'' is the best-known account of this belief, the belief predates the document. [[Abu al-Makarim]], writing in the last quarter of the twelfth century, makes one early reference to this belief that they possessed the Ark. &quot;The Abyssinians possess also the Ark of the Covenant&quot;, he wrote, and, after a description of the object, describes how the liturgy is celebrated upon the Ark four times a year, &quot;on the feast of the great nativity, on the feast of the glorious Baptism, on the feast of the holy Resurrection, and on the feast of the illuminating Cross.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;B.T.A. Evetts (translator), ''The Churches and Monasteries of Egypt and Some Neighboring Countries attributed to Abu Salih, the Armenian'', with added notes by Alfred J. Butler (Oxford, 1895), pp. 287f&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1992 book ''[[The Sign and the Seal]]'', controversial British writer [[Graham Hancock]] suggests, contrary to the ''Kebra Nagast'', that the ark spent several years in [[Egypt]] before it came to Ethiopia via the [[Nile River]], where it was kept in the islands of [[Lake Tana]] for about four hundred years and finally taken to Axum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hancock | first = Graham | title = The Sign and the Seal: The Quest for the Lost Ark of the Covenant | publisher = Crown | location = New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 0517578131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologist John Holladay of the [[University of Toronto]] called Hancock's theory &quot;garbage and hogwash,&quot; while [[Edward Ullendorff]], a former Professor of Ethiopian Studies at the [[University of London]], said he &quot;wasted a lot of time reading it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Does Trail to Ark of Covenant End Behind Aksum Curtain?

===Southern Africa===
The [[Lemba people]] of South Africa and Zimbabwe have claimed that their ancestors carried the Ark south, calling it the ''[[ngoma lungundu]]'' or &quot;voice of God&quot;, eventually hiding it in a deep cave in the Dumghe mountains, their spiritual home.&lt;ref&gt;''The Lost Ark of the Covenant'' by Tudor Parfitt, published by HarperCollins 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1715337,00.html ''A Lead on the Ark of the Covenant''], by David Van Biema Thursday, Time.com, Feb. 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 April 2008, in a UK [[Channel 4]] documentary, [[Tudor Parfitt]], taking a literalist approach to the Biblical story, described his research into this claim. He says that the object described by the Lemba has attributes similar to the Ark. It was of similar size, was carried on poles by priests, was not allowed to touch the ground, was revered as a voice of their God, and was used as a weapon of great power, sweeping enemies aside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/C/can_you_believe_it/debates/lostark.html|title=Debates &amp; Controversies - Quest for the Lost Ark|publisher=Channel4.com|date= 2008-04-14|accessdate=2010-03-07|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080513034056/http://www.channel4.com/culture/microsites/C/can_you_believe_it/debates/lostark.html|archivedate=May 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''The Lost Ark of the Covenant'' (2008), Parfitt also suggests that the Ark was taken to Arabia following the events depicted in the [[Second Book of Maccabees]], and cites Arabic sources which maintain it was brought in distant times to [[Yemen]]. One Lemba clan, the Buba, which was supposed to have brought the Ark to Africa, have a genetic signature called the [[Cohen Modal Haplotype]]. This suggests a male Semitic link to the [[Levant]]. Lemba tradition maintains that the Ark spent some time in [[Sena, Yemen|Sena]] in Yemen. Later, it was taken across the sea to East Africa and may have been taken inland at the time of the [[Great Zimbabwe civilization]]. According to their oral traditions, some time after the arrival of the Lemba with the Ark, it self-destructed. Using a core from the original, the Lemba priests constructed a new one. This replica was discovered in a cave by a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Germany|German]] missionary named Harald von Sicard in the 1940s and eventually found its way to the Museum of Human Science in [[Harare]].&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;/&gt;  Parfitt had this artifact radio-[[carbon dating|carbon dated]] to about 1350, which coincided with the sudden end of the [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe|Great Zimbabwe civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soas.ac.uk/news/newsitem4308 ]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;!-- unfortunately not archived on the Wayback Machine --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rome====
The Ark of the Covenant was said to have been kept in the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]], surviving the pillages of Rome by [[Genseric]] and [[Alaric I]] but lost when the basilica burned.&lt;ref&gt;J.

====United Kingdom====
In 2003, author [[Graham Phillips (author)|Graham Phillips]] hypothetically concluded that the Ark was taken to [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] in the Valley of [[Edom]] by the [[Maccabees]]. Phillips claims it remained there until the 1180s, when [[Ralph de Sudeley]], the leader of the [[Knights Templar|Templars]] found the Maccabean treasure at [[Jebel al-Madhbah]], and returned home to his estate at Herdewyke in [[Warwickshire, England]] taking the treasure with him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.factualtv.com/documentary/Legend-Hunters-Ark-of-the-Covenant Legend Hunters - Ark of the Covenant] (FactualTV - Knights Templar Documentary)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ireland====
During the turn of the 20th century [[British Israelism|British Israelites]] carried out some excavations of the [[Hill of Tara]] in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] looking for the Ark of the Covenant—the [[Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland]] campaigned successfully to have them stopped before they destroyed the hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ivan McAvinchey |url= http://www.rsai.ie/index.cfm?action=obj.display&amp;obj_id=153|title=News 2006 (March 9)|publisher=Rsai.ie|date= |accessdate= 2010-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arkofthecovenantatkingtutstomb.jpg|right|thumb|1922 photograph of the tomb of Tutankhamun. Photograph by [[Harry Burton (Egyptologist)|Harry Burton]] (1879-1940)]]
In 1922 in the Egyptian [[Valley of the Kings]] the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]] ([[KV62]]) was opened by [[Howard Carter]] and [[Lord Carnarvon]]. Among the artifacts was a processional ark, listed as Shrine 261, the [[Anubis Shrine]]. Almost immediately after publication of the photographs&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/gri/carter/gallery/HomePage.html Photographs by Harry Burton], The Griffith Institute, ''Tutankhamun: Anatomy of an Excavation: The Howard Carter Archives''.&lt;/ref&gt; of this sensational archaeological find some claimed that the Anubis Shrine could be the Ark of the Covenant. John M. Lundquist, author of ''The Temple of Jerusalem: past, present, and future'' (2008), discounts this idea. The Anubis Shrine measures {{convert|95|cm|in}} long, {{convert|37|cm|in}} wide, and {{convert|54.3|cm|in}} high in the shape of a [[pylon (architecture)|pylon]]. The Biblical Ark of the Covenant is approximately {{convert|133|cm|in}} long, {{convert|80|cm|in}} wide, and {{convert|80|cm|in}} high in the shape of a rectangular [[chest (furniture)|chest]].

He points out that Shrine 261 is not strictly analogous to the Ark of the Covenant: it can only be said that the Anubis Shrine is &quot;ark-like&quot;, constructed of wood,  [[gesso]]ed and gilded, stored within a sacred tomb, &quot;guarding&quot; the treasury of the tomb (and not the primary focus of that environment), that it contains compartments within it that store and hold sacred objects, that it has a figure of Anubis on its lid, and that it was carried by two staves permanently inserted into rings at its base and borne by eight priests in the funerary procession to Tutankhamun's tomb. Its value is the insight it provides to the ancient culture of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=R9VeCEwbNvsC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=%22+ark+of+the+covenant%22+Tutankhamun&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QU3cT8f4C-TB0gWw6r3-Cg&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22%20ark%20of%20the%20covenant%22%20ark%20of%20the%20covenant%22%20Tutankhamun&amp;f=false Lundquist, John M.

==In popular culture==
The Ark of the Covenant is the [[MacGuffin]] of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s 1981 [[adventure film]] ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'', is  mentioned briefly in the 1989 film ''[[Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade]]'' and appears in a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] in ''[[Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=Y-fYYc97uaIC Philip Kaufman - Annette Insdorf - Google Boeken&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Danish family film ''[[The Lost Treasure of the Knights Templar]]'' from 2006 the main part of the treasure found in the end is the Ark of the Covenant. The power of the ark comes from charged static electricity from different metal plates like a giant battery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://filmcentralen.dk/grundskolen/undervisning/tempelriddernes-skat#2170-5670 |title=Tempelriddernes Skat - Filmens Handling |publisher=filmcentralen.dk |date=2013 |accessdate=2014-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
