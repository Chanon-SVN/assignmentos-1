'''''Bacillus thuringiensis''''' (or '''Bt''') is a [[Gram-positive]], soil-dwelling [[bacterium]], commonly used as a [[biological pesticide]]. ''B. thuringiensis'' also occurs naturally in the gut of [[caterpillar]]s of various types of [[moth]]s and [[butterfly|butterflies]], as well on leaf surfaces, aquatic environments, animal feces, insect-rich environments, and flour mills and grain-storage facilities.&lt;ref name=Brock&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Madigan |editor1-first=Michael T. |editor2-last=Martinko |editor2-first=John M. |title=Brock Biology of Microorganisms |edition=11th |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-13-144329-7}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Nicolette |last=du Rand |title=Isolation of Entomopathogenic Gram Positive Spore Forming Bacteria Effective Against Coleoptera |type=PhD Thesis |publisher=University of KwaZulu-Natal |location=Pietermaritzburg, South Africa |date=July 2009 |id={{hdl|10413/1235}}}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[sporulation]], many Bt strains produce crystal proteins (proteinaceous inclusions), called [[δ-endotoxins]], that have [[Insecticide|insecticidal]] action. This has led to their use as insecticides, and more recently to [[genetically modified crops]] using Bt genes. Many crystal-producing Bt [[strain (biology)|strains]], though, do not have insecticidal properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roh&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=18051264 |year=2007 |last1=Roh |first1=JY |last2=Choi |first2=JY |last3=Li |first3=MS |last4=Jin |first4=BR |last5=Je |first5=YH |title=Bacillus thuringiensis as a specific, safe, and effective tool for insect pest control |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=547–59 |journal=Journal of microbiology and biotechnology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and mechanism of insecticidal action==
''B. thuringiensis'' was first discovered in 1901 by Japanese [[biologist]] Ishiwata Shigetane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Roh&quot; /&gt;  In 1911, ''B. thuringiensis'' was rediscovered in Germany by Ernst Berliner, who isolated it as the cause of a disease called ''Schlaffsucht'' in flour moth caterpillars. In 1976, Robert A. Zakharyan reported the presence of a plasmid in a strain of ''B. thuringiensis'' and suggested the plasmid's involvement in endospore and crystal formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zakharyan R.A ''et. el.'' |year=1979 |title=Plasmid DNA from Bacillus thuringiensis |journal=Microbiologiya |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=226–9 |issn=0026-3656}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Thomas Clement |editor1-last=Cheng |year=1984 |title=Pathogens of invertebrates: application in biological control and transmission mechanisms |isbn=978-0-306-41700-9 |page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''B. thuringiensis'' is closely related to ''[[Bacillus cereus|B.cereus]]'', a soil bacterium, and ''[[Bacillus anthracis|B.anthracis]]'', the cause of [[Anthrax disease|anthrax]]; the three organisms differ mainly in their [[plasmid]]s.&lt;ref name=Økstad&gt;Ole Andreas Økstad and Anne-Brit Kolstø [http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-7686-4_2#page-1 Chapter 2: Genomics of Bacillus Species] in M.

Cry toxins have specific activities against insect species of the orders [[Lepidoptera]] (moths and butterflies), [[Diptera]] (flies and mosquitoes), [[Coleoptera]] (beetles), [[Hymenoptera]] ([[wasp]]s, [[bee]]s, [[ant]]s and [[sawfly|sawflies]]) and [[nematode]]s. Thus, ''B. thuringiensis'' serves as an important reservoir of Cry toxins for production of biological insecticides and insect-resistant [[Genetically modified food|genetically modified crops]]. When insects ingest toxin crystals, their alkaline digestive tracts denature the insoluble crystals, making them soluble and thus  amenable to being cut with [[proteases]] found in the insect gut, which liberate the toxin from the crystal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stahly&quot;/&gt; The Cry toxin is then inserted into the insect gut cell membrane, paralyzing the digestive tract and forming a pore.&lt;ref name=ColoSt&gt;W.S.

This was the first instance of Bt resistance confirmed by Monsanto anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name=MonsantoWebCotton&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/Pages/india-pink-bollworm.aspx |title=Cotton in India |publisher=Monsanto.com |date=2008-11-03 |accessdate=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.327.5972.1439 |title=Hardy Cotton-Munching Pests Are Latest Blow to GM Crops |year=2010 |last1=Bagla |first1=P. |journal=Science |volume=327 |issue=5972 |page=1439 |pmid=20299559|bibcode = 2010Sci...327.1439B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monsanto immediately responded by introducing a second-generation cotton with multiple Bt proteins, which was rapidly adopted.&lt;ref name=MonsantoWebCotton /&gt; Bollworm resistance to first-generation Bt cotton was also identified in Australia, China, Spain, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nbt1382 |title=Insect resistance to Bt crops: Evidence versus theory |year=2008 |last1=Tabashnik |first1=Bruce E |last2=Gassmann |first2=Aaron J |last3=Crowder |first3=David W |last4=Carriére |first4=Yves |journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=199–202 |pmid=18259177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondary pests===
Several studies have documented surges in &quot;sucking pests&quot; (which are not affected by Bt toxins) within a few years of adoption of Bt cotton. In China, the main problem has been with [[mirids]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=20466880 |year=2010 |last1=Lu |first1=Y |last2=Wu |first2=K |last3=Jiang |first3=Y |last4=Xia |first4=B |last5=Li |first5=P |last6=Feng |first6=H |last7=Wyckhuys |first7=KA |last8=Guo |first8=Y |title=Mirid bug outbreaks in multiple crops correlated with wide-scale adoption of Bt cotton in China |volume=328 |issue=5982 |pages=1151–4 |doi=10.1126/science.1187881 |journal=Science|bibcode = 2010Sci...328.1151L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=David R. |last1=Just |first2=Shenghui |last2=Wang |first3=Per |last3=Pinstrup-Andersen |year=2006 |title=Tarnishing Silver Bullets: Bt Technology Adoption, Bounded Rationality and the Outbreak of Secondary Pest Infestations in China |conference=American Agricultural Economics Association Annual Meeting |location=Long Beach, CA |url=http://purl.umn.edu/21230 |laysource=Cornell Chronicle |laysummary=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/July06/Bt.cotton.China.ssl.html |laydate=July 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; which have in some cases &quot;completely eroded all benefits from Bt cotton cultivation”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1504/IJBT.2008.018348 |title=Bt-cotton and secondary pests |year=2008 |last1=Wang |first1=Shenghui |last2=Just |first2=David R. |last3=Pinstrup-Andersen |first3=Per |journal=International Journal of Biotechnology |volume=10 |issue=2/3 |pages=113–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in sucking pests depended on local temperature and rainfall conditions and increased in half the villages studied. The increase in insecticide use for the control of these secondary insects was far smaller than the reduction in total insecticide use due to Bt cotton adoption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1671-2927(09)60012-2 |title=Bt Cotton in China: Are Secondary Insect Infestations Offsetting the Benefits in Farmer Fields? |year=2009 |last1=Wang |first1=Zi-jun |last2=Lin |first2=Hai |last3=Huang |first3=Ji-kun |last4=Hu |first4=Rui-fa |last5=Rozelle |first5=Scott |last6=Pray |first6=Carl |journal=Agricultural Sciences in China |volume=8 |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study in five provinces in China found the reduction in pesticide use in Bt cotton cultivars is significantly lower than that reported in research elsewhere, consistent with the hypothesis suggested by recent studies that more pesticide sprayings are needed over time to control emerging secondary pests, such as aphids, spider mites, and lygus bugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10661-010-1439-y |title=Benefits of Bt cotton counterbalanced by secondary pests?

===Controversies===
{{Main|Genetically modified food controversies}}
There are controversies around GMOs on several levels, including whether making them is ethical, whether food produced with them is safe, whether such food should be labeled and if so how, whether agricultural biotech is needed to address world hunger now or in the future, and more specifically to GM crops—intellectual property and market dynamics; environmental effects of GM crops; and GM crops' role in industrial agricultural more generally.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, Frontline. [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/harvest/viewpoints/ Harvest of Fear: Viewpoints]&lt;/ref&gt; There are also issues specific to Bt transgenic crops.

====Lepidopteran toxicity====
The most publicised problem associated with Bt crops is the claim that pollen from Bt maize could kill the [[monarch butterfly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/20338 |year=1999 |last1=Losey |first1=John E. |last2=Rayor |first2=Linda S. |last3=Carter |first3=Maureen E. |journal=Nature |volume=399 |issue=6733 |page=214 |pmid=10353241 |title=Transgenic pollen harms monarch larvae|bibcode = 1999Natur.399..214L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper produced a public uproar and demonstrations against Bt maize; however by 2001 several follow-up studies coordinated by the USDA had proven that &quot;the most common types of Bt maize pollen are not toxic to monarch larvae in concentrations the insects would encounter in the fields.&quot;&lt;ref name=Waltz&gt;Emily Waltz for Nature News.

====Wild maize genetic mixing====
A study published in ''Nature'' in 2001 reported Bt-containing maize genes were found in maize in its center of origin, Oaxaca, Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11734853 |year=2001 |last1=Quist |first1=D |last2=Chapela |first2=IH |title=Transgenic DNA introgressed into traditional maize landraces in Oaxaca, Mexico |volume=414 |issue=6863 |pages=541–3 |doi=10.1038/35107068 |journal=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, paper concluded, &quot;the evidence available is not sufficient to justify the publication of the original paper.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11935145 |year=2002 |last1=Kaplinsky |first1=N |last2=Braun |first2=D |last3=Lisch |first3=D |last4=Hay |first4=A |last5=Hake |first5=S |last6=Freeling |first6=M |title=Biodiversity (Communications arising): Maize transgene results in Mexico are artefacts |volume=416 |issue=6881 |pages=601–2; discussion 600, 602 |doi=10.1038/nature739 |journal=Nature|bibcode = 2002Natur.416..601K }}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant controversy happened over the paper and ''Nature''{{'}}s unprecedented notice.&lt;ref name=&quot;pbs.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/now/science/genenature.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.organicconsumers.org/articles/article_17133.cfm]&lt;/ref&gt;

A subsequent large-scale study, in 2005, failed to find any evidence of genetic mixing in Oaxaca.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=16093316 |year=2005 |last1=Ortiz-García |first1=S |last2=Ezcurra |first2=E |last3=Schoel |first3=B |last4=Acevedo |first4=F |last5=Soberón |first5=J |last6=Snow |first6=AA |title=Absence of detectable transgenes in local landraces of maize in Oaxaca, Mexico (2003-2004) |volume=102 |issue=35 |pages=12338–43 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0503356102 |pmc=1184035 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |jstor=3376579 |bibcode=2005PNAS..10212338O}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2007 study found the &quot;transgenic proteins expressed in maize were found in two (0.96%) of 208 samples from farmers' fields, located in two (8%) of 25 sampled communities.&quot; Mexico imports a substantial amount of maize from the US, and due to formal and informal seed networks among rural farmers, many potential routes are available for transgenic maize to enter into food and feed webs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1890/1540-9295(2007)5[247:TPIMIT]2.0.CO;2 |year=2007 |volume=5 |pages=247–52 |title=Transgenic proteins in maize in the Soil Conservation area of Federal District, Mexico |last1=Serratos-Hernández |first1=José-Antonio |last2=Gómez-Olivares |first2=José-Luis |last3=Salinas-Arreortua |first3=Noé |last4=Buendía-Rodríguez |first4=Enrique |last5=Islas-Gutiérrez |first5=Fabián |last6=De-Ita |first6=Ana |journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment |issue=5 |issn=1540-9295}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One study found small-scale (about 1%) introduction of transgenic sequences in sampled fields in Mexico; it did not find evidence for or against this introduced genetic material being inherited by the next generation of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=19143938 |year=2009 |displayauthors=3|last1=Piñeyro-Nelson |first1=A |last2=Van Heerwaarden |first2=J |last3=Perales |first3=HR |last4=Serratos-Hernández |first4=JA |last5=Rangel |first5=A |last6=Hufford |first6=MB |last7=Gepts |first7=P |last8=Garay-Arroyo |first8=A |last9=Rivera-Bustamante |first9=R |title=Transgenes in Mexican maize: Molecular evidence and methodological considerations for GMO detection in landrace populations |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=750–61 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03993.x |pmc=3001031 |journal=Molecular ecology}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/456149a |title=Modified genes spread to local maize |year=2008 |last1=Dalton |first1=Rex |journal=Nature |volume=456 |issue=7219 |page=149 |pmid=19005518}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That study was immediately criticized, with the reviewer writing, &quot;Genetically, any given plant should be either nontransgenic or transgenic, therefore for leaf tissue of a single transgenic plant, a GMO level close to 100% is expected.

====Colony collapse disorder====
As of 2007, a new phenomenon called [[colony collapse disorder]] (CCD) began affecting [[Honey bee|bee]] hives all over North America. Initial speculation on possible causes ranged from new parasites to pesticide use&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/News/docs.htm?docid=15572 |title=ARS : Questions and Answers: Colony Collapse Disorder |work=ARS News |date=2008-05-29 | accessdate=2008-11-23| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081105121119/http://www.ars.usda.gov/News/docs.htm?docid=15572| archivedate= 5 November 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the use of Bt transgenic crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Latsch |first=Gunther |title=Are GM Crops Killing Bees? |work=[[Spiegel Online]] |date=March 22, 2007 |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/collapsing-colonies-are-gm-crops-killing-bees-a-473166.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mid-Atlantic Apiculture Research and Extension Consortium]] found no evidence that pollen from Bt crops is adversely affecting bees.&lt;ref name=Waltz&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/461027a |title=GM crops: Battlefield |year=2009 |last1=Waltz |first1=Emily |journal=Nature |volume=461 |issue=7260 |pages=27–32 |pmid=19727179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1051/apido:2007022 |title=Effects of Bt corn pollen on honey bees: Emphasis on protocol development |year=2007 |last1=Rose |first1=Robyn |last2=Dively |first2=Galen P. |last3=Pettis |first3=Jeff |journal=Apidologie |volume=38 |issue=4 |pages=368–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the USDA, &quot;Genetically modified (GM) crops, most commonly Bt corn, have been offered up as the cause of CCD. But there is no correlation between where GM crops are planted and the pattern of CCD incidents. Also, GM crops have been widely planted since the late 1990s, but CCD did not appear until 2006. In addition, CCD has been reported in countries that do not allow GM crops to be planted, such as Switzerland. German researchers have noted in one study a possible correlation between exposure to Bt pollen and compromised immunity to Nosema.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;USDA.

==Beta-exotoxins==

Some isolates of ''B. thuringiensis'' produce a class of insecticidal small molecules called beta-exotoxin, the common name for which is thuringiensin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ofmpub.epa.gov/apex/pesticides/f?p=CHEMICALSEARCH:3:0::NO:1,3,31,7,12,25:P3_XCHEMICAL_ID:4063 |title=EPA pesticide database |publisher=Ofmpub.epa.gov |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2013-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A consensus document produced by the OECD says: &quot;Beta-exotoxin and the other ''Bacillus'' toxins may contribute to the insecticidal toxicity of the bacterium to lepidopteran, dipteran, and coleopteran insects. Beta-exotoxin is known to be toxic to humans and almost all other forms of life and its presence is prohibited in'' B. thuringiensis'' microbial products. Engineering of plants to contain and express only the genes for δ-endotoxins avoids the problem of assessing the risks posed by these other toxins that may be produced in microbial preparations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Staff Environment Directorate, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
