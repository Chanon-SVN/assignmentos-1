{{nihongo|'''''Bubblegum Crisis'''''|バブルガムクライシス|Baburugamu Kuraishisu|lead=yes}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[cyberpunk]] [[OVA|OVA series]]. The series involves the adventures of the Knight Sabers, an all-female group of [[mercenaries]] who don [[powered armor]] and fight various problems, most frequently rogue robots. 

The series begins in the late 2032, seven years after the Second Great Kanto Earthquake has split [[Tokyo]] geographically and culturally in two. During the first episode, disparities in wealth are shown to be more pronounced than in previous periods in post-war Japan. The main antagonist is Genom, a [[megacorporation]] with immense power and global influence. Its main product are [[Boomer (Bubblegum Crisis)|boomers]] - cyberdroids used for manual labor and military purposes. While Boomers are intended to serve mankind, they become deadly instruments in the hands of ruthless individuals. The AD Police are tasked to deal with Boomer-related crimes. One of the series' themes is the inability of the department to deal with threats due to political infighting, [[red tape]], and an insufficient budget.

== Production ==

The [[Original Video Animation|OVA]] series is eight episodes long. It was originally slated to run for 13 episodes, but due to legal problems between the two studios who jointly held the rights to the series, [[Artmic]] and [[Youmex]], the series was discontinued. 

The setting displays strong influences from the movie ''[[Blade Runner]]''. The &quot;boomers&quot; also resemble Terminators from the [[The Terminator|Terminator]] film. 

Nearly all of the music is available, as there are 8 soundtrack releases (one per OVA), as well as numerous &quot;vocal&quot; albums which feature songs &quot;inspired by&quot; the series as well as many drawn directly from it.

==Release==

Bubblegum Crisis is notable also in that it was one of the few early anime series that were brought over from [[Japan]] unedited and subtitled with [[English language|English]] captions that still have a great deal of popularity today. While anime has become much more popular in the intervening years, in 1991 it was still mostly unknown as a storytelling medium in North America.

A digitally-remastered compilation of the original series' episodes, featuring bi-lingual tracks and production extras, was released on DVD in 2004 by [[AnimEigo]] Inc. Animeigo successfully crowd-funded the show for a North American Blu-ray release, on [[Kickstarter]] in November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/madoverlord/bubblegum-crisis-ultimate-edition-blu-ray-set&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comic book ===

In Japan, a number of comic books were produced that featured characters and storylines based in the same universe. Some were very much thematically linked to the OVA series, while others were &quot;one-shots&quot; or comedy features. A number of artists participated in the creation of these comics, including [[Kenichi Sonoda]], who had produced the original Knight Saber character designs. A North American comic based in the Bubblegum Crisis Universe was published in [[English language|English]] by [[Dark Horse Comics]].
