'''Abimelech''' (also spelled '''Abimelek''' or '''Avimelech'''; {{Hebrew Name 2|אֲבִימֶלֶךְ|אֲבִימָלֶךְ|Avimélekh|Avimálekh|ʼĂḇîméleḵ|ʼĂḇîmāleḵ|&quot;father/leader of a king; my father/leader, a king&quot;}}) was the name of multiple [[Philistine]] [[monarch|kings]] mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]].

==Etymology==
Abimelech's name is thought to mean ''my father is king'', and could be simply a generic title given to a [[crown prince]].  This is supported in the ''[[Haggada]]'' when &quot;Benmelech&quot; (&quot;son of the king&quot;), son of Abimelech, changes his own name to Abimelech when he becomes king.

At the time of the [[Amarna tablets]] (mid-14th century BC), there was an Egyptian governor of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] similarly named [[Abimilki]], who is sometimes speculated to be connected with one or more of the biblical Abimelechs.

==Abimelech of Gerar==

Abimelech was most prominently the name of a polytheistic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benamozegh|first=Elia|title=Israel and Humanity|year=1995|publisher=Paulist Press International|isbn=978-0809135417|author2=Maxwell Luria|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Victor P.|title=Exodus: An Exegetical Commentary|year=2012|publisher=Baker Academic|isbn=978-0801031830|url=http://books.google.com/?id=vUry0cGNR_IC&amp;pg=PT1003&amp;lpg=PT1003&amp;dq=Abimelech{{!}}Abimilek+polytheism#v=onepage&amp;q=Abimelech{{!}}Abimilek%20polytheism&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; king of [[Gerar]] who is mentioned in two of the three [[wife-sister narratives in Genesis]], in connection with both [[Abraham]] (chap. 20) and [[Isaac]] (chap. 26).  The ''[[Haggada]]'' identifies them as references to separate people, the second being the first Abimelech's son, and that his original name was Benmelech (&quot;son of the King&quot;) but changed his name to his father's.

King Abimelech of Gerar also appears in an extra-biblical tradition recounted in texts such as the [[Clementine literature|''Kitab al-Magall'']], the ''[[Cave of Treasures]]'' and the ''[[Conflict of Adam and Eve with Satan]]'', as one of 12 regional kings in Abraham's time said to have built the city of [[Jerusalem]] for [[Melchizedek]].

==Other people with this name==

Apart from the king (or kings) of Gerar, the Bible also records this name for:
*[[Abimelech (Judges)]], proclaimed king after the death of his father Gideon ({{bibleverse||Judges|9:1-6|HE}}).
*The son of [[Abiathar]], and [[List of High Priests of Israel|high priest]] in the time of David ({{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|18:16|HE}}). In the parallel passage, {{bibleverse|2|Samuel|8:17|HE}}, the name is given as [[Ahimelech]]; most authorities consider this the more correct reading.
*The king of [[Gath (city)|Gath]] better known as [[Achish]], referred to as Abimelech or Achimelech in the title of {{bibleverse||Psalm|34|HE}}.

Other literary references include:
*Abimélech, [[Satrap]] of [[Gaza City|Gaza]] is a character (baritone) in [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]]' opera ''[[Samson and Delilah (opera)|Samson and Delilah]]'' (Weimar, 1877)
