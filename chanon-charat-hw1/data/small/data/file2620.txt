'''The Beach Boys''' are an American [[Rock music|rock]] band, formed in [[Hawthorne, California]] in 1961. The group's original lineup consisted of brothers [[Brian Wilson|Brian]], [[Dennis Wilson|Dennis]] and [[Carl Wilson]], their cousin [[Mike Love]], and friend [[Al Jardine]]. Emerging at the vanguard of the &quot;[[California Sound]]&quot;, the band's early music gained international popularity for their distinct [[vocal harmony|vocal harmonies]] and lyrics reflecting a [[southern California]] [[youth culture]] of [[surfing]], cars, and romance. Influenced by [[jazz]]-based [[vocal music|vocal group]]s, 1950s [[rock and roll]], and [[doo-wop]], Brian led the band to experiment with several [[musical genre|genres]] ranging from [[pop ballad]]s to [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] and [[baroque pop|baroque]] while devising novel approaches to [[record producer|music production]] and [[arrangement|arranging]]. While initially managed by the Wilsons' father [[Murry Wilson|Murry]], Brian's creative ambitions and sophisticated songwriting abilities dominated the group's musical direction.

Released in 1966, the ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' album and the &quot;[[Good Vibrations]]&quot; single featured an intricate and multi-layered sound that represented a departure from the simple [[surf rock]] of the Beach Boys' early years. Soon after, Brian gradually ceded control to the rest of the band, reducing his input due to [[mental health]] and [[substance abuse]] issues. Though the more democratic incarnation of the Beach Boys recorded a string of albums in various musical styles that garnered international critical success, the group struggled to reclaim their commercial momentum in America. Since the 1980s, much-publicized legal wrangling over royalties, songwriting credits and use of the band's name transpired. Dennis drowned in 1983 and Carl died of lung cancer in 1998. After Carl's death, many live configurations of the band fronted by Mike Love and [[Bruce Johnston]] continued to tour into the 2000s while other members pursued solo projects. For the band's 50th anniversary, the surviving co-founders briefly reunited for a [[That's Why God Made the Radio|new studio album]] and [[The Beach Boys 50th Anniversary Reunion Tour|world tour]].

At the time of his sixteenth birthday on June 20, 1958, Brian Wilson shared a bedroom with his brothers, Dennis and Carl – aged thirteen and eleven, respectively – in their family home in Hawthorne. He had watched his father, [[Murry Wilson]], play piano, and had listened intently to the harmonies of vocal groups such as [[the Four Freshmen]].{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=3}} After dissecting songs such as &quot;[[Ivory Tower (1956 song)|Ivory Tower]]&quot; and &quot;[[Good News (musical)|Good News]]&quot;, Brian would teach family members how to sing the background harmonies.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=12}} For his birthday that year, Brian was given a [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape recorder]]. He learned how to [[overdub]], using his vocals and those of Carl and their mother.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=3}} Brian would play piano with Carl and [[David Marks (musician)|David Marks]], an eleven-year-old longtime neighbor, playing the guitars they had each received as Christmas presents.{{sfn|Stebbins|2007|p=18}}

Soon Brian and Carl were avidly listening to [[Johnny Otis]]' [[KFOX (AM)|KFOX radio]] show.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=3}} Inspired by the simple structure and vocals of the [[rhythm and blues]] songs he heard, Brian changed his piano-playing style and started writing songs.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} His enthusiasm interfered with his music studies at school. Family gatherings brought the Wilsons in contact with cousin [[Mike Love]]. Brian taught Love's sister Maureen and a friend harmonies.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=3}} Later, Brian, Mike Love and two friends performed at [[Hawthorne High School (Hawthorne, California)|Hawthorne High School]].{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=5}} Brian also knew Al Jardine, a high school classmate who had already played guitar in a folk group called the Islanders.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Brian suggested to Jardine that they team up with his cousin and brother Carl. It was at these sessions, held in Brian's bedroom, that &quot;the Beach Boys sound&quot; began to form. Love encouraged Brian{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} to write songs and gave the fledgling band its name: &quot;The Pendletones&quot;,{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=21}} a portmanteau of &quot;[[Pendleton Woolen Mills|Pendleton]]&quot;, a style of woolen shirt popular at the time and &quot;[[Musical tone|tone]]&quot;, the musical term. Although [[surfing]] motifs were very prominent in their early songs, Dennis was the only avid surfer in the group.&lt;ref name=pc20/&gt; He suggested that the group compose songs celebrating the sport and the lifestyle which had developed around it within [[Southern California]].&lt;ref name=RockHallofFame/&gt;{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=328}}{{refn|group=nb|[[Nick Venet]] has said that none of the members including Dennis surfed until after the fact.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=60}} }}

[[File:Beach Boys 1963.jpg|thumb|175px|The Beach Boys, in [[Pendleton Woolen Mills|Pendleton]] outfits, performing at a local high school]]
Jardine and a singer friend, Gary Winfrey, went to Brian to see if he could help out with a version of a folk song they wanted to record—&quot;[[Sloop John B]]&quot;.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In Brian's absence, the two spoke with their father, a music industry veteran of modest success. Murry arranged for the Pendletones to meet his publisher, Hite Morgan.&lt;ref name=RockHallofFame /&gt; The group performed a slower ballad, &quot;[[Their Hearts Were Full of Spring]]&quot;, but failed to impress Morgan. After an awkward pause, Dennis mentioned they had an original song, &quot;Surfin{{'&quot;}}.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Brian finished the song, and together with Mike Love, wrote &quot;[[Surfin' Safari]]&quot;.{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=328}} The group rented guitars, drums, amplifiers and microphones, and practiced for three days while the Wilsons' parents were on a short vacation. In October 1961, the Pendletones recorded the two surfing song demos in twelve takes at Keen Recording Studio.{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=328}}{{failed verification|date=December 2014}}{{refn|group=nb|David Marks was not present at the session as he was in school that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/exclusive-q-a-original-beach-boy-david-marks-on-the-bands-anniversary-tour-20120316 |title=Exclusive QA: Original Beach Boy David Marks on the Band's Anniversary Tour &amp;#124; Music News |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=March 16, 2012 |accessdate=February 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Murry brought the demos to Herb Newman, owner of [[Candix Records]] and [[Era Records]], and he signed the group on December 8, 1961.{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=328}} When the boys eagerly unpacked the first box of singles – released both under the Candix label, and also as a promo issue under X Records (Morgan's label) – they were shocked to see their band had been renamed as the Beach Boys.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Murry Wilson called Morgan{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} and learned that Candix wanted to name the group the Surfers to directly associate them with the increasingly-popular teen sport. But [[Russ Regan]], a young promoter with Era Records – who later became president of [[20th Century Fox Records]] – noted that there already existed a group by that name, and he suggested calling them the Beach Boys.{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=328}}

Released in December 1961, &quot;[[Surfin' (song)|Surfin{{'-}}]]&quot; was soon aired on [[KFWB]] and [[KRLA]], two of Los Angeles' most influential teen radio stations. It was a hit on the West Coast, going to number three in Southern California, and peaked at number 75 on the national pop charts. By the final weeks of 1961 &quot;Surfin{{'&quot;}} had sold more than 40,000 copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;photobucket13&quot;&gt;[http://i351.photobucket.com/albums/q476/marcus1970/hit%20parader%201966/HitParaderp6October1966.jpg &quot;The Beach Boy Empire&quot; Taylor, Derek. October 5, 1966. Hit Parader, p13]&lt;/ref&gt; Murry Wilson told the boys he did not like &quot;Surfin{{'&quot;}}. By now the [[de facto]] manager of the Beach Boys, he landed the group's first paying gig (for which they earned $300) on New Year's Eve, 1961, at the [[Ritchie Valens]] Memorial Dance in [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]],{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=328}} headlined by [[Ike &amp; Tina Turner]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Although Murry effectively seized managerial control of the band, Brian acknowledged that he &quot;deserves credit for getting us off the ground... he hounded us mercilessly... [but] also worked hard himself&quot;. In the first half of February 1962, Jardine left the band and was replaced by Marks. The band recorded two more originals on April 19 at Western Studios, Los Angeles; &quot;Lonely Sea&quot; and &quot;[[409 (song)|409]]&quot;, also re-recording &quot;[[Surfin' Safari (song)|Surfin' Safari]]&quot;. On June 4, the band released their second single &quot;Surfin' Safari&quot; backed with &quot;409&quot;. The release prompted national coverage in the June 9 issue of ''[[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]]'' where the magazine praised Love's lead vocal and deemed the song to have strong hit potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=June 9, 1962 |title=Reviews of New Singles |journal=Billboard Magazine |volume= 74 |issue= 23 |page=40 |publisher= Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |doi= |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=sSkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PP4 |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After being turned down by [[Dot Records|Dot]] and [[Liberty Records|Liberty]], the Beach Boys eventually signed a seven-year contract with [[Capitol Records]] on July 16 based on the strength of the June demo session.&lt;ref name=&quot;photobucket13&quot;/&gt; This was at the urging of Capitol exec [[Nik Venet]] who signed the group, finding them to be the &quot;teenage gold&quot; he had been scouting.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=62}} By November, their first album was ready—''Surfin' Safari'' which reached 32 on the US Billboard charts. Their song output continued along the same commercial line, focusing on California youth lifestyle.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=71}}&lt;ref name=pc20&gt;{{Gilliland |url=http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19770/m1/ |title=Show 20 – Forty Miles of Bad Road: Some of the best from rock 'n' roll's dark ages. [Part 1&amp;#93; : UNT Digital Library |accessdate=November 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1963, three months after the release of their debut album, the band began recording their sophomore effort, ''Surfin' U.S.A.'', a breakthrough for Brian, who began asserting himself as songwriter and arranger.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=71}} The LP was the start of Brian's penchant for [[doubletracking]] vocals,{{sfn|Trynka|Bacon|1996|p=126}} a pioneering innovation which provided the Beach Boys with an exceptionally bright sound.{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=56}} Released on March 25, 1963, ''Surfin' U.S.A.'', met a more enthusiastic reception, reaching number two on the Billboard charts,{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} propelling the band into a nationwide spotlight, and was vital to launching surf music as a national craze.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=71}} Five days prior to the release of ''Surfin' U.S.A.'', Brian produced &quot;[[Surf City (song)|Surf City]]&quot;, a song he had written for [[Jan and Dean]]. &quot;Surf City&quot; hit number one on the ''Billboard'' charts in July 1963, a development that pleased Brian but angered Murry, who felt his son had &quot;given away&quot; what should have been the Beach Boys' first chart-topper.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

At the beginning of a tour of the Mid-West in April 1963, Jardine rejoined the Beach Boys at Brian's request.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Beach Boys&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebeachboys.com/home.aspx |title=The Beach Boys |publisher=The Beach Boys |accessdate=November 23, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he began playing live gigs again, Brian left the road to focus on writing and recording. The result of this arrangement produced the albums ''Surfer Girl'', released on September 16, 1963 and ''Little Deuce Coupe'', released less than a month later on October 7, 1963. This sextet incarnation of the Beach Boys did not extend beyond these two albums, as Marks officially left the band in early October due to conflict with manager Murry, pulling Brian back into touring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GIGS63 |first=Andrew G. |last=Doe |authorlink= |year=2012 |accessdate=October 26, 2012 |url=http://www.esquarterly.com/bellagio/gigs63.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time, Brian began using members of [[The Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]] to augment his increasingly demanding studio arrangements.{{sfn|Trynka|Bacon|1996|p=127}} Session musicians that participated on Wilson's productions were said to have been awestruck by his musical abilities, as drummer [[Hal Blaine]] explained, &quot;We all studied in conservatories; we were trained musicians. We thought it was a fluke at first, but then we realized Brian was writing these incredible songs. This was not just a young kid writing about high school and surfing.&quot;{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=46}} For composer [[Frank Zappa]], the most exciting thing to him in &quot;white-person-music&quot; was when the Beach Boys used the progression V–II on &quot;[[Little Deuce Coupe (song)|Little Deuce Coupe]]&quot;, calling it &quot;an important step forward by going backward.&quot;{{sfn|Zappa|1989|p=187}} A standalone Christmas-themed single, &quot;[[Little Saint Nick]]&quot;, was released in December 1963, backed with an [[a capella]] rendition of the [[Lord's Prayer|scriptural]] song &quot;[[The Lord's Prayer (1935 song)|The Lord's Prayer]]&quot;. The A-side peaked at number 3 on the US ''Billboard'' Christmas chart.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=45}}

Following a successful Australasian tour in January and February 1964, the band returned home to face the [[British Invasion]] through the Beatles appearances on the [[Ed Sullivan Show]]. Signed to the same label as the Beach Boys, Capitol immediately began waning their support for the group, causing Murry to fight proactively for the band at the label more than before, often showing up to their offices in person without a call in advance in order to &quot;twist executive arms&quot;.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=50}} Brian reacted to the Beatles with pronounced bemusement: &quot;I was flipping out. I couldn't understand how a group could be just yelled and screamed at. The music they made, '[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]' for example, wasn't even that great a record, but they just screamed at it. ... It got us off our asses in the studio. We started cutting – we said 'look, don't worry about the Beatles, we'll cut our own stuff.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=[[David Espar|Espar, David]], [[Robert Levi|Levi, Robert]] (Directors)|year=1995|title=Rock &amp; Roll|medium=[[Miniseries]]|url=|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly,{{by whom|date=December 2014}} Brian wanted more time to complete their next album, yet Capitol insisted they finish recording swiftly to avoid being forgotten in the throes of the impending invasion.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Satisfying these demands, the band hastily finished the sessions on February 20, 1964 and titled the album ''Shut Down Volume 2''. &quot;[[Fun, Fun, Fun]]&quot; was released as a single from the album (backed with &quot;[[Why Do Fools Fall in Love (song)|Why Do Fools Fall in Love]]&quot;) and was a major hit. The LP, while containing several [[filler (media)|filler tracks]], was propelled by other songs such as the melancholic &quot;[[The Warmth of the Sun]]&quot; and the advanced production style of &quot;[[Don't Worry Baby]]&quot;.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|pp=71}}

Brian soon wrote his last surf song in April 1964.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=51}} That month, during recording of the single &quot;[[I Get Around]]&quot;, Murry was relieved of his duties as manager. Brian reflected, &quot;We love the family thing – y'know: three brothers, a cousin and a friend is a really beautiful way to have a group – but the extra generation can become a hang-up&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;photobucket13&quot;/&gt; When the single was released in May of that year, it would climb to number one, their first single to do so. Two months later, the album that the song later appeared on, ''All Summer Long'', reached number four on the Billboard 200 charts. ''All Summer Long'' introduced exotic textures to the Beach Boys' sound exemplified by the [[piccolo]]s and [[xylophone]]s of [[All Summer Long (The Beach Boys song)|its title track]].{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=110}} The album was a swan-song to the surf and car music the Beach Boys built their commercial standing upon. Later albums took a different stylistic and lyrical path.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|pp=72–73}} Before this, a live album, ''[[Beach Boys Concert]]'', was released in October to a four-week chart stay at number one, containing a setlist of previously-recorded hits and [[cover version|covers]] that they hadn't yet recorded.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=72}}

(1965)|description= &quot;[[Let Him Run Wild]]&quot; belongs to a group of many Wilson/Love composed songs from 1965 which incorporate higher production values, denser arrangements and more personal lyrics than before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwald |first=Matthew |url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/let-him-run-wild-mt0032095649 |title=Let Him Run Wild – The Beach Boys : Listen, Appearances, Song Review |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=February 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In June 1964, Brian began recording the bulk of ''The Beach Boys' Christmas Album'' with a forty-one-piece studio orchestra in collaboration with [[The Four Freshmen|Four Freshmen]] arranger Dick Reynolds. Released in December, it was divided between five new, original Christmas-themed songs and seven reinterpretations of traditional Christmas songs.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=59–60}} One single from the album, &quot;[[The Man with All the Toys]]&quot;, was released, peaking at number 6 on the US ''Billboard'' Christmas chart.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=75}} On October 29, the Beach Boys performed for ''[[The T.A.M.I. Show]]'', a concert film intended to bring together a wide range of hit-making musicians for a one-off performance. The result was released to movie theaters one month later.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=30–31}}

By the end of the year, the stress of road travel, composing, producing and maintaining a high level of creativity became too much for Brian. On December 23, while on a flight from Los Angeles to Houston, he suffered a [[panic attack]] only hours after performing with the Beach Boys on the [[variety show|musical variety series]] ''[[Shindig!]]''.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=63–64}} In January 1965, he announced his withdrawal from touring to concentrate entirely on songwriting and record production. For the rest of 1964 and into 1965, [[Glen Campbell]] served as Wilson's temporary replacement in concert, until his own career success pulled him from the group in April 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1543|label=Glen Campbell|accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Johnston was asked to locate a replacement for Campbell; having failed to find one, Johnston himself became a full-time member of the band on May 19, 1965, first replacing Brian on the road and later contributing in the studio, beginning with the vocal sessions for &quot;[[California Girls]]&quot; on June 4, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p18553|label=Bruce Johnston|accessdate=April 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquarterly.com/bellagio/gigs65.html |title=GIGS65 |publisher=Esquarterly.com |accessdate=May 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brian Wilson I Just Wasn't Made For These Times.png|thumb|left|200px|Brian Wilson working at a studio session]]

After Brian relinquished touring in 1965, he became a full-time studio artist, showcasing a great leap forward with ''The Beach Boys Today!'', an album containing a suite-like structure divided by songs and [[ballad]]s which portended the [[Album Era]] with its cohesive artistic statement.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=111}} During the recording sessions for ''Today!'', Love told [[Melody Maker]] that he and the band wanted to look beyond [[surf rock]] and to avoid living in the past or resting on their laurels.&lt;ref name=Welch1964&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Welch|first1=C|title=Beach Boys Brought their own vegetables - so audiences beware!|journal=Melody Maker|date=November 14, 1964|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting LP had largely guitar-oriented pop songs such as &quot;[[Dance, Dance, Dance (song)|Dance, Dance, Dance]]&quot; and &quot;[[Good to My Baby]]&quot; on side A with B-side ballads such as &quot;[[Please Let Me Wonder]]&quot; and &quot;[[She Knows Me Too Well]]&quot;.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=72}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.allmusic.com/song/dance-dance-dance-t14595755| title =Dance, Dance, Dance| publisher = Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Today!'' marked a maturation in the Beach Boys' lyric content by abandoning themes related to surfing, cars, or teenage love. Some love songs remained, but with a marked increase in depth, along with introspective tracks accompanied by adventurous and distinct arrangements.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=111}}{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=58}}

In June 1965, the band released ''Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)''. The album included a reworked arrangement of &quot;[[Help Me, Rhonda]]&quot; which had become the band's second number one single in the spring of 1965, displacing the Beatles' &quot;[[Ticket to Ride]]&quot;. &quot;[[Let Him Run Wild]]&quot; tapped into the youthful angst that would later pervade their music.{{according to|date=August 2014}} In November 1965, the group followed up their US number-three-charting &quot;California Girls&quot; from ''Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)'' with another top-twenty single, &quot;[[The Little Girl I Once Knew]]&quot;. It was considered the band's most experimental statement thus far,{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=72}} using silence as a pre-chorus, clashing keyboards, moody brass and vocal tics.{{according to|date=August 2014}} The single continued Brian's ambitions for daring arrangements, featuring unexpected tempo changes and numerous false endings.{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=59}} Perhaps too extreme an arrangement{{according to|date=August 2014}}  to go much higher than its number 20 peak, it was the band's second single not to reach the top ten since their 1962 breakthrough.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Capitol demanded a Beach Boys LP for the 1965 Christmas season, and to appease them, Brian conceived ''Beach Boys' Party!'', a live-in-the-studio album consisting mostly of acoustic covers of 1950s rock and R&amp;B songs, in addition to covers of three Beatles songs, [[Bob Dylan]]'s &quot;[[The Times They Are a-Changin' (song)|The Times They Are a-Changin']]&quot;, and idiosyncratic rerecordings of the group's earlier hits.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=71}} In December they scored an unexpected number two hit (number three in the UK) with &quot;[[Barbara Ann]]&quot;, which Capitol released as a single with no band input.

In 1966, the Beach Boys formally established their use of unconventional instruments and elaborate layers of vocal harmonies on their groundbreaking record ''Pet Sounds''.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=72}}{{sfn|Tunbridge|2011|p=173}} It is considered Brian's most concise demonstration of his production and songwriting expertise.{{sfn|MacFarlane|2008|pp=37–38}}{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=113}} With songs such as &quot;[[Wouldn't It Be Nice]]&quot; and &quot;[[Sloop John B]]&quot;, the album's innovative [[soundscape]] incorporates elements of pop, [[jazz music|jazz]], [[classical music|classical]], [[exotica]], and the [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]].{{sfn|Stebbins|2011|p=151}} The instrumentation combines [[found sound]]s such as [[bicycle bell]]s and dog whistles with classically-inspired orchestrations and the usual rock set-up of drums and guitars;{{sfn|Tunbridge|2010|p=173}}{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=72}} among others, [[silver (household)|silverware]], [[accordion]]s, plucked piano strings, barking dogs, and plastic water jugs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis1990&quot;/&gt; For the basic rhythmic feel for &quot;[[God Only Knows]]&quot;, [[harpsichord]], piano with [[slapback echo]], [[sleigh bell]]s, and [[string section|strings]] [[spill (audio)|spilled]] into each other to create a rich blanket of sound.{{sfn|Zak|2001|p=88}} It is considered by some as a Brian Wilson solo album in all but name, as other members contributed relatively little to the compositions or recordings.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=106}}{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=72}}{{sfn|Jones|2008|p=41}} Influenced by [[psychedelic drug]]s, Brian turned inward and probed his deep-seated self-doubts and emotional longings; the piece did not address the problems in the world around them, unlike other [[psychedelic rock]] groups.{{sfn|DeRogatis|2003|pp=34–35}} As [[Jim Miller (musician)|Jim Miller]] wrote of the album's tone, &quot;[It] vented Wilson's obsession with isolation cataloging a forlorn quest for security. The whole enterprise, which smacked of [[song cycle]] pretensions, was streaked with regret and romantic langour.&quot;{{sfn|Miller|1992|p=195}} According to Brian, the album was designed as a collection of art pieces which belong together yet could stand alone.{{sfn|Tunbridge|2010|p=174}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PopGenius&quot;/&gt;

Released in May, ''Pet Sounds'' eventually peaked at number eleven in the US and number two in the UK,{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=85, 88}}{{verification needed|date=December 2014}} an accomplishment which helped the Beach Boys become the strongest selling album act in the UK for the final quarter of 1966, dethroning the three-year reign of native bands such as the Beatles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Andrews |first1=Grame |date=March 4, 1967 |title=Americans Regain Rule in England |journal=Billboard Magazine |volume= 79 |issue= 9 |pages=1, 10 |publisher= Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |doi= |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=CykEAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification needed|date=October 2014}} Met with a lukewarm critical reception in the US,{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=85}} ''Pet Sounds'' was indifferently promoted by Capitol and failed to become the major hit Wilson had hoped it would be.&lt;ref name=pc37&gt;{{Gilliland|url=http://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19796/m1/ |title=Show 37 – The Rubberization of Soul: The great pop music renaissance.

In ''The Album: A Guide to Pop Music's Most Provocative, Influential, and Important Creations'', author James Perone championed the album for its complex orchestrations, sophisticated compositions, and varied [[tone color]]s, calling it a remove from &quot;just about anything else that was going on in 1966 pop music.&quot;{{sfn|Perone|2012|pp=28–30}} In 1976, journalist [[Robin Denselow]] wrote: &quot;With the 1966 ''Pet Sounds'' album … Wilson had become America's equivalent of the Beatles with his ability to expand the limits of popular taste.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Riding a wave&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robin |last=Denselow |title=Feature: ''Riding a wave'' |journal=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |issue=September 1, 1976 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul McCartney]] named it one of his favorite albums of all time on multiple occasions, calling it the primary impetus for the Beatles' album ''[[Sgt.

|title=&quot;Good Vibrations&quot; (1966)
|description=&quot;[[Good Vibrations]]&quot; was the Beach Boys' third song to top the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. For some, the song was clearly linked not only to the beginnings of [[progressive rock]]{{sfn|Romano|2010|p=17}}{{sfn|Martin|1998|p=40}} but also [[acid rock]].{{sfn|Romano|2010|p=17}}

Seeking to expand on ''Pet Sounds''' advances, Wilson began an even more ambitious project: &quot;[[Good Vibrations]]&quot;. Like ''Pet Sounds'', Brian opted for an eclectic array of instruments rarely heard in pop music.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=116}} Described by Brian as a &quot;pocket symphony,&quot;{{sfn|DeRogatis|2003|p=638}} it contains a mixture of classical, rock, and exotic instruments structured around a [[cut-up technique|cut-up mosaic]] of musical sections represented by several discordant key and modal shifts.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|pp=41-46}} It became the Beach Boys' biggest hit to date and a US and UK number one single in 1966. Coming at a time when pop singles were usually made in under two hours, it was one of the most complex pop productions ever undertaken, and the most expensive single ever recorded to that point.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=116}}{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=55}}{{sfn|Harrison|1997|pp=41–46}} The production costs were estimated between $50,000 and $75,000  (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50000|1966|r=-4}}}} and ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|75000|1966|r=-4}}}} today) with sessions for the song stretching over several months in at least four major studios.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|pp=41–46}} According to [[Domenic Priore]], the making of &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; was unlike anything previous in the realms of classical, jazz, international, soundtrack or any other kind of recording.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=55}}

The single was an unequivocal milestone in studio productions,{{sfn|Perone|2004|p=16}}{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=116}}{{sfn|Priore|2005|pp=55–56}}{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=66}} and continued in establishing Brian as an extender of popular tastes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riding a wave&quot;/&gt; To the counterculture of the 1960s, &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; served as an anthem.{{sfn|Guinn|2014|p=130}} Rock critic Gene Sculatti prophesied in 1968, &quot;[It] may yet prove to be the most significantly revolutionary piece of the current rock renaissance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Scalluti1968&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sculatti|first1=Gene|url=http://www.teachrock.org/resources/article/villains-and-heroes-in-defense-of-the-beach-boys/|title=Villains and Heroes: In Defense of the Beach Boys|journal=Jazz &amp; Pop|date=September 1968|accessdate=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its instrumentation included the [[Tannerin]], an easier-to-manipulate version of a [[theremin]] which helped the Beach Boys claim a new [[hippie]] audience.&lt;ref&gt;C. Heylin, ''The Act You've Known For All These Years: the Life, and Afterlife, of Sgt. Pepper'' (London: Canongate Books, 2007), ISBN 1-84195-955-3, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Holmes|2008|p=415}}  Upon release, the single prompted an unexpected revival in theremins while increasing awareness of [[analog synthesizer]]s, leading [[Moog Music]] to produce their own brand of [[ribbon controller|ribbon-controlled]] instruments.{{sfn|Pinch|Trocco|2009|pp=102–3}} Reflecting on this period in 1971, ''[[New York (magazine)|Cue]]'' magazine wrote: &quot;In the year and a half that followed ''Pet Sounds'', the Beach Boys were among the vanguard in practically every aspect of the counter culture – psychedelia, [[art rock]], a return to roots, ecology, organic food, the cooled-out sound – anticipating changes that rock didn't accomplish until 1969–1970.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pet Sounds|journal=Cue|date=1971|volume=40|issue=27|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EwgwAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A short-lived film [[production company]] entitled Home Movies was established by the group during this time. It was supposed to have created live action film and television properties which star the Beach Boys. Only one music video was completed by the company for &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, though various other psychedelic sequences and segments exist.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=116}}

''Smile'' would go on to become the most legendary unreleased album in the history of popular music.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=72}}{{sfn|Jones|2008|p=63}} In the decades following its non-release, it became the subject of intense speculation and mystique.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=118}}{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=55}} Many believe that, had the album been released, it would have substantially altered the group's direction, establishing them at the vanguard of rock innovators.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=119}} Writing about the album for the [[33⅓]] book series, Luis Sanchez believed: &quot;If Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys were going to survive as the defining force of American pop music they were, ''Smile'' was a conscious attempt to rediscover the impulses and ideas that power American consciousness from the inside out. It was a collaboration that led to some incredible music, which, if it had been completed as an album and delivered to the public in 1966, might have had an incredible impact.&quot;{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=112}}

Many factors combined to put intense pressure on Brian Wilson as ''Smile'' neared completion: his own mental instability, the pressure to create against fierce internal opposition to his new music, the relatively unenthusiastic response to ''Pet Sounds'' in the United States, Carl Wilson's [[military draft|draft]] resistance, and a major dispute with Capitol Records.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Furthermore, Wilson's reliance on both prescription drugs and [[amphetamine]]s exacerbated his underlying mental health problems. Comparable to [[Brian Jones]] and [[Syd Barrett]], Brian Wilson's use of psychedelic drugs—especially [[LSD]]—led to a nervous breakdown in the late-1960s.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} As his legend grew, the ''Smile'' period came to be seen as the pivotal episode in his decline and he became tagged as one of the most notorious celebrity drug casualties of the rock era.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=72}}{{failed verification|date=August 2014}}

Some ''Smile'' tracks were salvaged and re-recorded in scaled-down versions at [[Brian Wilson's home studio|Brian's new home studio]]. Along with the single version of &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, these tracks were released on ''Smiley Smile'', an album which elicited positive critical and commercial response abroad, but was the first real commercial failure for the group in the United States.{{sfn|DeRogatis|1996|p=18}} By this time the Beach Boys' management (Nick Grillo and [[David Anderle]]) had created the band's own record label, [[Brother Records|Brother]]. One of the first labels to be owned by a rock group, Brother Records was intended for releases of Beach Boys side projects, and as an invitation to new talent.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The initial output of the label, however, was limited to ''Smiley Smile'' and two resulting singles from the album; the failure of &quot;[[Gettin' Hungry]]&quot; caused the band to shelve Brother until 1970.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Despite the cancellation of ''Smile'', several tracks—including &quot;[[Our Prayer]]&quot;, &quot;[[Cabin Essence]]&quot; and &quot;[[Surf's Up (song)|Surf's Up]]&quot;—continued to trickle out in later albums often as [[filler (media)|filler songs]] to offset Brian's unwillingness to contribute.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=148}} The band was still expecting to complete and release ''Smile'' as late as 1973 before it became clear that only Brian could comprehend the endless fragments that had been recorded.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=179}} ''Smiley Smile'' was followed up three months later with ''[[Wild Honey (album)|Wild Honey]]'', featuring songs written by Wilson and Love, including the hit &quot;[[Darlin' (The Beach Boys song)|Darlin']]&quot; and a rendition of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s &quot;[[I Was Made to Love Her (song)|I Was Made to Love Her]]&quot;. The album fared better than its predecessor, reaching number 24 in the US.

Compounding the group's recent setbacks, their public image took a cataclysmic hit following their withdrawal from the 1967 [[Monterey Pop Festival]]{{sfn|Guinn|2014|p=130}} for the reason that they had no new material to play while their forthcoming single and album lay in limbo.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=122}} Their cancellation was seen as &quot;a damning admission that they were washed up [and] unable to compete with the 'new music'&quot;.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=179}} This notion was exacerbated by ''Rolling Stone'' writer [[Jann Wenner]], whom within contemporary publications criticized Brian Wilson for his oft-repeated &quot;genius&quot; label which he called a &quot;promotional shuck&quot; and an attempt to compare with the Beatles.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=179}} However, Wenner later responded to their ''Wild Honey'' album with more optimism, remarking two months later that &quot;[i]n any case it's good to see that the Beach Boys are getting their heads straight once again&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/wild-honey-19680224|accessdate=June 22, 2013|title=Wild Honey|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|location=New York|date=February 24, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former band publicist [[Derek Taylor]] later recalled a conversation with Brian and Dennis where they denied that the group had ever written surf music or songs about cars, and that the Beach Boys had never been involved with the surf and hot rod fads, as Taylor claimed, &quot;…they would not concede.&quot;{{sfn|Kent|2009|p=31}} As a result of their initial target demographic and subsequent failures to blend with the hippie movement, the group was viewed as unhip relics,{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=154}} even though they had once been, as biographer [[Peter Ames Carlin]] wrote, &quot;the absolute center of the American rock ’n’ roll scene,&quot;{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=138}} a time when they had ushered the psychedelic era.{{sfn|DeRogatis|2003|p=32}}{{sfn|McCleary|2004|p=42}} In early 1969, Brian proposed that the group change their name from &quot;the Beach Boys&quot; to &quot;the Beach&quot;, reasoning for the simple fact that the band members were now grown men. Going to the effort of acquiring a contract which would declare a five-way agreement to officially rename the group, [[Stephen Desper]] reported, &quot;They all just kind of shrugged and said, 'Aw, come on, Brian, we don't wanna do that. That's how the public knows us, man. And that was it. He put the paper on the piano and it stayed there until I picked it up and took it away.&quot;{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=147}}

For a short time in mid-1968, Brian Wilson sought psychological treatment in hospital.{{sfn|Carlin|2006}} During his absence, other members began writing and producing material themselves. To complete their contract with Capitol, they produced one more album. ''20/20'' (1969) was one of the group's most stylistically diverse albums, including [[hard rock]] songs such as &quot;[[All I Want to Do (The Beach Boys song)|All I Want to Do]]&quot;, the [[waltz]]-based &quot;[[Time to Get Alone]]&quot; and a remake of [[the Ronettes]]' &quot;[[I Can Hear Music]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.allmusic.com/song/bluebirds-over-the-mountain-t995513|title =Bluebirds over the Mountain | publisher=Allmusic| accessdate=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.snopes.com/risque/tattled/alliwant.asp|title =All I Want to Do| publisher=Barbra and David P.

In the US, the album reached a modest 68.

In spring 1968, Dennis began a tumultuous [[Charles Manson#Involvement with Wilson, Melcher, et al.|relationship with musician]] [[Charles Manson]] which persisted for several months afterward. Dennis bought him time at Brian's home studio where recording sessions were attempted while Brian stayed in his room.{{sfn|Guinn|2014|pp=168–70, 340}} It was then proposed by Dennis that Manson be signed to Brother Records, though Brian reportedly disliked Charlie, and so a deal was never made.{{sfn|Guinn|2014|p=168}} Without Manson's involvement, the Beach Boys did record one song penned by Manson: &quot;Cease to Exist&quot; rewritten as &quot;[[Never Learn Not To Love]]&quot;. The idea of the Beach Boys recording one of his songs reportedly thrilled Manson, and it was released as a Beach Boys single. After accruing a large monetary debt to the group, Dennis deliberately omitted Manson's credit on its release while also altering the song's arrangement and lyrics.{{sfn|Guinn|2014|p=186}} This greatly angered Manson.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=137–48}}{{sfn|Badman|2004|pp=221–23}} Growing fearful, Dennis gradually distanced himself from Manson, [[Manson family|whose family]] had taken over his home.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=224}} He was eventually convicted for [[Conspiracy (criminal)|murder conspiracy]]; from there on, Dennis was too afraid of the Manson family to ever speak publicly on his relationship, let alone testify against him.{{sfn|Guinn|2014|pp=322–23}}{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=257}}

On April 12, 1969, the band revisited their 1967 lawsuit against Capitol Records after they alleged an audit undertaken revealed the band were owed over US$2,000,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|2000000|1969|r=-4}}}} today) for unpaid royalties and production duties.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=221}} The band's contract with Capitol Records expired on June 30, 1969, after which Capitol Records deleted the Beach Boys' catalog from print, effectively cutting off their royalty flow.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=221}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BBTIMELINE 1969|first=Andrew G. |last=Doe |authorlink=|year=2012 |accessdate=August 14, 2013 |url=http://www.esquarterly.com/bellagio/1969.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1969, Murry Wilson sold [[Sea of Tunes]], the Beach Boys' catalogue, to Irving Almo Music, a decision which according to [[Marilyn Wilson]] &quot;devastated Brian&quot;.{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=224–5}} In late 1969, the Beach Boys reactivated their Brother label and signed with [[Reprise Records|Reprise]]. Around this time, the band commenced recording for a new album. At the time the Beach Boys tenure ended with Capitol in 1969, they had sold 65 million records worldwide, closing the decade as the most commercially successful American group in popular music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | date=November 14, 1970 |title=The Best Kept Secret in the World: &quot;The Most Dynamic Vocal Group Rock Has Produced&quot; |journal=Billboard Magazine |volume= 82 |issue= 46 |page=4 |publisher= Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |doi= |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=sSkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PP4 |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, armed with the new Reprise contract, the band appeared rejuvenated, releasing the album ''Sunflower'' to critical acclaim in the UK but indifference in the US.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=73}} The album features a strong group presence with significant writing contributions from all band members.{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=73}} Brian was active during this period, writing or co-writing seven of the twelve songs on ''Sunflower'' and performing at half of the band's domestic concerts in 1970. ''Sunflower'' reached number 29 in the UK and number 151 in the US, the band's lowest domestic chart showing to that point.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=153–154}} A version of &quot;[[Cottonfields]]&quot; arranged by Al Jardine appeared on European releases of ''Sunflower'' and as a single, reached number one in Australia, Norway, South Africa and Sweden and the top-five in six other countries, including the UK.

After ''Sunflower'', the band hired [[Jack Rieley]] as their manager. Under Rieley's management, the group's music began emphasizing political and social awareness.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=155}} During this time, Carl Wilson gradually assumed leadership of the band and Rieley contributed lyrics. On August 30, 1971 the band released ''Surf's Up'', named after the Brian Wilson/Van Dyke Parks composition &quot;[[Surf's Up (song)|Surf's Up]]&quot;. The album was moderately successful, reaching the US top 30, a marked improvement over their recent releases. While the record charted, the Beach Boys added to their renewed fame by performing a near-sellout set at [[Carnegie Hall]], followed by an appearance with the [[Grateful Dead]] at [[Fillmore East]] on April 27, 1971. The live shows during this era included reworked arrangements of many of the band's previous songs.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=155–8}} A large portion of their [[set list]]s culled from ''Pet Sounds'' and ''Smile'', as author Domenic Priore observes, &quot;They basically played what they could have played at the Monterey Pop Festival in the summer of 1967.&quot;{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=140}}

Johnston ended his first stint with the band shortly after ''Surf's Up'''s release, reportedly{{by whom|date=May 2014}} because of friction with Rieley. At Carl's suggestion, the addition of [[Ricky Fataar]] and [[Blondie Chaplin]] in February 1972 led to a dramatic restructuring in the band's sound. The album ''Carl and the Passions – &quot;So Tough&quot;'' was an uncharacteristic mix that included two songs written by Fataar and Chaplin. For their next project the band, their families, assorted associates and technicians moved to the Netherlands for the summer of 1972. They rented a farmhouse to convert into a makeshift studio where recording sessions for the new project would take place. By the end of their sessions, the band felt they had produced one of their strongest efforts yet.{{according to|date=May 2014}} Reprise, however, felt that the album required a strong single. This resulted in the song &quot;[[Sail On, Sailor]]&quot;, a collaboration between Brian Wilson, [[Tandyn Almer]], [[Raymond Louis Kennedy|Ray Kennedy]], Jack Rieley and Van Dyke Parks featuring a soulful lead vocal by Chaplin.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=184, 305}} Reprise subsequently approved and the resulting album, ''[[Holland (album)|Holland]]'', was released early in 1973, peaking at number 37. Brian's musical children story, &quot;Mount Vernon and Fairway (A Fairy Tale)&quot;, narrated by Rieley and strongly directly influenced by [[Randy Newman]]'s ''[[Sail Away (Randy Newman album)|Sail Away]]'' album, was included as a bonus [[extended play|EP]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=181–2}} Despite indifference from Reprise, the band's concert audience started to grow.

''[[The Beach Boys in Concert]]'', a double album documenting the 1972 and 1973 US tours, was another top-30 album and became the band's first [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] under Reprise. During this period the band established itself as one of America's most popular live acts. Chaplin and Fataar helped organize the concerts to obtain a high quality live performance, playing material off ''Surf's Up'', ''Carl and the Passions'' and ''Holland'' and adding songs from their older catalog. This concert arrangement lifted them back into American public prominence. In late 1973, the soundtrack to [[American Graffiti]], ''[[41 Original Hits from the Soundtrack of American Graffiti]]'', was released to mass commercial and critical success.{{according to|date=May 2014}} The soundtrack included early Beach Boy songs &quot;[[Surfin' Safari]]&quot; and &quot;[[All Summer Long (The Beach Boys song)|All Summer Long]]&quot; and was a catalyst in creating a wave of nostalgia that reintroduced the Beach Boys into contemporary American consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/readers-poll-the-10-greatest-summer-songs-20130522/6-the-beach-boys-all-summer-long-0368776 |title=Readers' Poll: The 10 Greatest Summer Songs Pictures - 6.

The record sleeve's sunny, colorful graphics caught the mood of the nation{{according to|date=May 2014}} and surged to the top of the ''Billboard'' album charts.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=123}} It was the group's first multi-million selling record since &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;, and remained on the album chart for two years.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=123}} The following year, Capitol released a second compilation, ''[[Spirit of America (The Beach Boys album)|Spirit of America]]'', which also sold well. With these compilations, the Beach Boys became one of the most popular acts in rock, propelling themselves from opening for [[Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young]] to headliners selling out basketball arenas in a matter of weeks.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=193–4}} ''Rolling Stone'' named the Beach Boys the &quot;Band of the Year&quot; for 1974, solely on the basis of their juggernaut touring schedule and material written over a decade earlier.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=194}}{{quotation needed|date=May 2014}}

Rieley, who remained in the Netherlands after ''Holland''{{'}}s release, was relieved of his managerial duties in late 1973.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Chaplin also left in late 1973 after an argument with Steve Love, the band's business manager (and Mike's brother).{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=194}} Fataar remained until 1974, when he was offered a chance to join a new group led by future [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] member [[Joe Walsh]].{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=194}} Chaplin's replacement, [[James William Guercio]], started offering the group career advice that resulted in his becoming their new manager.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=194}} Under Guercio, the Beach Boys staged a highly successful 1975 joint concert tour with [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], with each group performing some of the other's songs, including their previous year's collaboration on Chicago's hit &quot;[[Wishing You Were Here]]&quot;.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=194}} Beach Boys vocals were also heard on [[Elton John]]'s 1974 hit &quot;[[Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me]]&quot;.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Nostalgia had settled into the Beach Boys' hype;{{according to|date=May 2014}} the group had not officially released any new material since 1973's ''Holland''.

[[File:Brian Wilson 1976.png|thumb|left|Brian Wilson behind [[Brother Studios]]' mixing console in 1976]]

The album was generally disliked by fans and critics upon release.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=364}} During its sessions, Brian's production role was belittled as group members overdubbed and remixed tracks to fight against his desire for a rough, unfinished sound.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=358}} Carl and Dennis disparaged the album to the press while Brian admitted &quot;[undoubtedly] the new album is nothing too deep,&quot; but remained hopeful that their next release would be on par with the group's &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=364}}

For the remainder of 1976 to early 1977, Brian spent his time making sporadic public appearances and producing the band's next album ''Love You'' (1977), a quirky collection of 14 songs mostly written, arranged and produced by Brian. Brian revealed to Peter Ames Carlin that ''Love You'' is one of his favorite Beach Boys releases, telling him &quot;That's when it all happened for me. That's where my heart lies.&quot;{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=290}} ''Love You'' peaked at number 28 in the UK and number 53 in the US and developed a [[cult following]]; regarded as one of the band's best albums by fans and critics alike, and an early work of [[synthpop]].&lt;ref name=RockHallofFame/&gt;

{{Quote box| width=23%|align=right|quote=&quot;A diseased bunch of motherfuckers if ever there was one … But the miracle is that the Beach Boys have made that disease sound like the literal babyflesh pink of health … Maybe it's just that unprickable and ingenuous wholesomeness that accounts not only for their charm, but for their beauty—a beauty so awesome that listening to them at their best is like being in some vast dream cathedral decorated with a thousand gleaming American pop culture icons.&quot;

Referring to &quot;naysayers&quot; of the album, the underground [[fanzine]] ''Scram'' wrote &quot;fuck [them] … [the album showcases] a truly original mix of humor and sadness. The original numbers always dance just a step away from the cliché, dealing with simple lyrical themes that make you wonder why they had never been explored before.&quot;{{sfn|Cooper|Smay|2004}} ''[[The A.V.

Wilson sings frayed songs about roller-skating, road-tripping, and [[Johnny Carson]]—like a frazzled man sitting in a corner chanting 'calm blue ocean' over and over.

After ''Love You'' was released, Brian began to record and assemble ''Adult/Child'', an unreleased effort largely consisting of songs written by Wilson from 1976 and 1977 with select [[big band]] arrangements by Dick Reynolds.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=222}} Though publicized as the Beach Boys' next release, ''Adult/Child'' caused tension within the group and was ultimately shelved.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=222}} Following this period, his concert appearances with the band gradually diminished and their performances were occasionally erratic.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=226}}

The internal wrangling came to a head after a show at [[Central Park]] on September 1, 1977, when the band effectively split into two camps; Dennis and Carl Wilson on one side, Mike Love and Al Jardine on the other with Brian remaining neutral. Following a confrontation on an airport tarmac,{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=216–217}} the band broke up for two and a half weeks, until a band meeting on September 17, at Brian's house. In light of a potential new Caribou Records the parties negotiated a settlement resulting in Love gaining control of Brian's vote in the group, allowing Love and Jardine to outvote Carl and Dennis Wilson on any matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BBTIMELINE |first=Andrew G. |last=Doe |authorlink=|year=2012 |accessdate=October 26, 2012 |url=http://www.esquarterly.com/bellagio/1977.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Beach Boys' last album for Reprise, ''M.I.U. Album'' (1978), was recorded at [[Maharishi International University]] in Iowa at the suggestion of Love.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=224}} Dennis and Carl made limited contributions; the album was mostly produced by Jardine and Ron Altbach, with Brian appearing as &quot;Executive Producer&quot;.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=225}} ''M.I.U.'' was largely a contractual obligation to finish out their association with Reprise, who likewise did not promote the result.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=224}} The record cemented the divisions in the group. Love and Jardine focused on rock and roll-oriented material while Carl and Dennis chose the progressive focus they had established with the albums ''Carl and the Passions'' and ''Holland''.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Dennis withdrew from the group to focus on his second solo album and follow-up to ''[[Dennis Wilson|Pacific Ocean Blue]]'' entitled ''[[Dennis Wilson#Bambu|Bambu]]''. However, alcoholism and marital problems overcame all three Wilson brothers and ''Bambu'' was shelved.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=124}} Carl appeared intoxicated during concerts (notably at appearances on their disastrous 1978 Australia tour) and Brian gradually slid back into addiction and an unhealthy lifestyle.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=226–7}}

After departing Reprise, the Beach Boys signed with [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]]. They received a substantial advance and were paid $1 million per album even as CBS deemed their preliminary review of the band's first product, ''L.A. (Light Album)'' as unsatisfactory. Faced with the realization that Brian was unable to contribute, the band recruited Johnston as producer. The result paid off, as &quot;[[Good Timin' (The Beach Boys song)|Good Timin']]&quot; became a top 40 single. The group enjoyed moderate success with a disco reworking of the ''Wild Honey'' song &quot;[[Here Comes the Night]]&quot; which was followed by their highest charting UK single in nine years: Jardine's &quot;[[Lady Lynda]]&quot; peaked at number 6 in the UK Singles Chart.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The album was followed in 1980 by ''Keepin' the Summer Alive'', with Johnston once again producing. Barring an appearance on percussion on the closing track, &quot;Endless Harmony&quot;, Dennis Wilson was absent from this album.

In 1981, Carl quit the group due to unhappiness with the band's nostalgia format and lackluster live performances, subsequently pursuing a solo career.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=124}} He returned in May 1982 – after approximately 14 months of being away – on the condition that the group reconsider their rehearsal and touring policies, along with refraining from &quot;[[Las Vegas]]-type engagements&quot;.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=373}}

That year, they released the eponymous album ''The Beach Boys'' and enjoyed a resurgence of interest later in the 1980s, assisted by tributes such as [[David Lee Roth]]'s hit version of &quot;California Girls&quot;.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} &quot;[[Getcha Back]]&quot;, released from the album, gave the group a number 26 single in the US. Following this, the group put out &quot;[[Rock and Roll to the Rescue]]&quot; (US, number 68) and a cover of [[the Mamas &amp; the Papas]]' &quot;[[California Dreamin']] (US, number 57).{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=330}} {{sfn|Warner|1992|p=330}} In 1987, they played with the [[Hip hop music|rap]] group [[The Fat Boys]], performing the song &quot;[[Wipe Out (song)|Wipe Out]]&quot; and filming a [[music video]]. It was a number 12 single in the US.{{sfn|Warner|1992|p=330}}

By 1988, Brian Wilson had officially left the Beach Boys and released his [[Brian Wilson (album)|first solo album]], which received critical acclaim.{{according to|date=May 2014}} During this period the band unexpectedly claimed their first US number one hit single in 22 years with &quot;Kokomo&quot;, which had appeared in the movie ''[[Cocktail (1988 film)|Cocktail]]''. Written by [[John Phillips (musician)|John Phillips]], [[Scott McKenzie]], Mike Love and [[Terry Melcher]], the song became the band's largest selling single of all time.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The video for the song received heavy airplay on the music video channel [[VH1]], and prominently featured actor [[John Stamos]] on [[conga drum]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] earlier in the year, the group became the second artist after [[Aretha Franklin]] to hit number one in the US after their induction.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} They released the album ''Still Cruisin''', which went gold in the US and gave them their best chart showing since 1976.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In 1990, the band gathered several studio musicians and recorded the Melcher-produced title track of the comedy ''[[Problem Child (1990 film)|Problem Child]]''. Stamos again appeared on the video, and later appeared singing lead vocals on &quot;Forever&quot; (written by Dennis Wilson for the ''Sunflower'' album) and on their 1992 album ''Summer in Paradise''. Having no new contributions from Brian Wilson due to interference from caretaker [[Eugene Landy]], ''Summer in Paradise'' was poorly regarded by both critics and fans, was a commercial disaster and would become their last album of original material for two decades.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Members of the band appeared on several television shows such as ''[[Full House]]'', ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'', and ''[[Baywatch]]'' in the late 1980s and 1990s.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In 1989, Wilson filed a lawsuit to reclaim the rights to his songs and the group's publishing company, [[Sea of Tunes]], which he had supposedly signed away to his father Murry in 1969. He successfully argued that he had not been mentally fit to make an informed decision and that his father had potentially forged his signature. While Wilson failed to regain his copyrights, he was awarded $25&amp;nbsp;million for unpaid royalties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beachboys.com/history.html &quot;The Beach Boys – The complete Guide&quot;], ''beachboys.com''&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after Wilson won his case, Love discovered that Murry Wilson had not properly credited him as co-writer on dozens of Beach Boys songs. With Love and Brian Wilson unable to determine exactly what Love was properly owed, Love sued Wilson in 1992, winning $13&amp;nbsp;million in 1994 for lost royalties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1994-12-13/business/fi-8511_1_beach-boys-lead-singer &quot;Company Town : Beach Boys' Mike Love Wins His Case...&quot;] ''Los Angeles Times'' December 13, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; In interviews, Love revealed that on some songs he wrote most of the lyrics, on others only a line or two. Even though Love sued Wilson, both parties said in interviews that there was no malice between them; they simply couldn't come up with an agreeable settlement by themselves.{{quotation needed|date=May 2014}}

In 1993, the band appeared in [[Michael Feeney Callan]]'s film ''The Beach Boys Today'', which included in-depth interviews with all members except Brian. Carl confided to Callan that Brian would record again with the band at some point in the near future.{{quotation needed|date=May 2014}} A few Beach Boys sessions devoted to new Brian Wilson compositions occurred during the mid-1990s, but they remain largely unreleased, and the album was quickly aborted due to tenuous relations.&lt;ref name=mojo2004 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Back To The Beach|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,296612,00.html|accessdate=June 30, 2013 |newspaper=Entertainment|date=Mar 31, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1996, the Beach Boys guested with [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]] on a re-recording of &quot;[[Fun, Fun, Fun]]&quot;, which became a British Top-30 hit.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In June, the group worked with comedian [[Jeff Foxworthy]] on the recording &quot;Howdy From Maui&quot;, and eventually released ''Stars and Stripes Vol. 1'' in August 1996. The album consisted of country renditions of several Beach Boys hits, performed by popular country artists such as [[Toby Keith]] and [[Willie Nelson]]. Brian Wilson, who was in a better mental state at the time, acted as co-producer.

In early 1997, Carl Wilson was diagnosed with [[lung cancer]] and brain cancer after years of heavy smoking. Despite his terminal condition, Carl continued to perform with the band on its 1997 summer tour while undergoing chemotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pond |first=Steve |url=http://search.proquest.com.ezproxy1.library.arizona.edu/iimp/docview/1192920/E7810EDC50B34729PQ/2?accountid=8360 |title=Carl Wilson: 1946-1998 |publisher=University of Arizona}}&lt;/ref&gt; During performances, he sat on a stool and reportedly needed oxygen after every song. Carl was able to stand, however, when he played on &quot;[[God Only Knows]]&quot;.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Carl died on February 6, 1998, two months after the death of the Wilsons' mother, Audree.

===Band split and name conflicts===
[[File:The Beach Boys concierto.jpg|thumb|left|The touring line-up of Mike Love and Bruce Johnston's &quot;The Beach Boys Band&quot;, plus guest member David Marks, in 2008]]
Following Carl's death, the remaining members splintered. Love, Johnston and former guitarist Marks continued to tour without Jardine, initially as &quot;America's Band&quot;, but following several cancelled bookings under that name, they sought authorization through Brother Records Inc. (BRI) to tour as &quot;The Beach Boys&quot; and secured the necessary license.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} In turn Jardine began to tour regularly with his band dubbed &quot;Beach Boys: Family &amp; Friends&quot; until he ran into legal issues for using the name without license; meanwhile, Jardine sued Love and Brian claiming that he had been excluded from their concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jardine Loses &quot;Beach Boys&quot;|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/jardine-loses-beach-boys-20010803|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=August 3, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; BRI, through its longtime attorney, Ed McPherson, sued Jardine in Federal Court. Jardine, in turn, counter-claimed against BRI for wrongful termination. BRI ultimately prevailed after several years. Love was allowed to continue to tour as The Beach Boys, while Jardine was prohibited from touring using any form of the name.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Released from Landy's control, Brian Wilson sought different treatments for his illnesses that aided him in his solo career. He toured regularly with his backing band consisting of members of [[Wondermints]] and other LA/Chicago musicians. Marks also maintained a solo career. Their tours remained reliable draws, with Wilson and Jardine both remaining legal members of the Beach Boys organization and BRI.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The surviving group members appeared as themselves for the 1998 documentary film ''[[Endless Harmony: The Beach Boys Story]]'', directed by [[Alan Boyd]]. Following the success of 1997's ''[[The Pet Sounds Sessions]]'', many compilations were then issued by Capitol containing new archival material: ''[[Endless Harmony Soundtrack]]'' (1998), ''[[Ultimate Christmas]]'' (1998), and ''[[Hawthorne, CA (album)|Hawthorne, CA]]'' (2001).

In 2004, Wilson recorded and released his solo album ''[[Brian Wilson Presents Smile]]'', a reinterpretation of the ''Smile'' project that he initiated with the Beach Boys thirty-six years earlier. That September, Wilson issued a free CD through the ''[[Daily Mail|Mail On Sunday]]'' that included Beach Boys songs he'd recently rerecorded, five of which he'd co-authored with Love. The 10 track compilation had 2.6 million copies distributed and prompted Love to file a lawsuit in November 2005; he claimed the promotion hurt the sales of the original recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/nov/04/entertainment/et-quick4.4 |title=Mike Love sues Brian Wilson |last1=Lewis |first1=Randy |date=November 4, 2005 |website=http://www.latimes.com/ |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Love's suit was dismissed in 2007 when a judge determined that there were no triable issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/16/entertainment/et-quick16.1 |title=Beach Boys lawsuit dismissed |last1=Lewis |first1=Randy |date=May 16, 2007 |website=http://www.latimes.com/ |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=August 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 13, 2006, the five surviving Beach Boys (Wilson, Love, Jardine, Johnston, and Marks) appeared together for the celebration of the 40th anniversary of ''Pet Sounds'' and the double-platinum certification of their greatest hits compilation, ''[[Sounds of Summer: The Very Best of The Beach Boys]]'', in a ceremony atop the Capitol Records building in Hollywood. Plaques were awarded for their efforts, with Wilson accepting on behalf of Dennis and Carl. Throughout the year, it was rumored that the band would reform to perform the ''Pet Sounds'' album live in its entirety in November. Ultimately, Wilson began a brief ''Pet Sounds'' tour with Jardine and no other group members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Doe|first1=Andrew Grayham|title=BBTIMELINE 2006|url=http://www.esquarterly.com/bellagio/2006.html|publisher=Endless Summer Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 31, 2011, the Beach Boys released surviving 1960s recordings from ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]'' in the form of ''[[The Smile Sessions]]''. The album—even in its incomplete form—garnered universal critical acclaim and experienced popular success, charting in both the Billboard US and UK Top 30. The band was rewarded with glowing reviews, including inclusion in Rolling Stone's Top 500 album list at number 381. ''The Smile Sessions'' went on to win Best Historical Album at the 2013 Grammy Awards. Brian Wilson personally accepted the award stating &quot;I guess Van Dyke and I were on to something after all.&quot;{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In February 2011, the Beach Boys released &quot;[[Don't Fight the Sea]]&quot;, a charity single to aid the victims of the 2011 Japan earthquake. The single, released on Jardine's 2011 album ''A Postcard From California'' featured Jardine, Wilson, Love and Johnston, with prerecorded vocals by Carl Wilson.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Rumors then circulated regarding a potential 50th anniversary band reunion.

On December 16, 2011, it was announced that Wilson, Love, Jardine, Johnston and Marks would reunite for a new album and [[Beach Boys 50th Anniversary Reunion Tour|50th anniversary tour in 2012]] to include a performance at the [[New Orleans Jazz Festival]] in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/B/Beach_Boys/2011/12/16/19133156.html|title=Beach Boys gear up for reunion |accessdate=December 16, 2011 | work=Sun Media|first=Darryl|last=Sterdan|date=December 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 12, 2012, the Beach Boys performed at the 2012 Grammy Awards, in what was billed as a &quot;special performance&quot; by organizers.

Later in 2012, the group released the ''[[Fifty Big Ones]]'' and ''Greatest Hits'' compilations along with reissues of 12 of their albums. The next year, the group released ''[[Live – The 50th Anniversary Tour]]'' a 41 song, 2-CD set documenting their ''50th Anniversary Tour''.

===Resumed band split===

In June 2012, Love announced additional touring dates which would not feature Wilson.

On October 5, Love announced in a self-written press release to the ''LA Times'' that the band would return to its pre-50th Reunion Tour lineup with him and Johnston touring as the Beach Boys without Wilson, Jardine, and Marks:

Four days later, Wilson and Jardine submitted a written response to the rumors stating: &quot;After Mike booked a couple of shows with Bruce, Al and I were, of course, disappointed.

==Musical style and development==
{{See also|The Beach Boys lineups}}

In ''Understanding Rock: Essays in Musical Analysis'', [[music theory|music theorist]] [[Daniel Harrison (music theorist)|Daniel Harrison]] summarizes:

{{quote|Even from their inception, the Beach Boys were an [[experimental music|experimental]] group. They combined, as [[Jim Miller (musician)|Jim Miller]] has put it, &quot;the instrumental sleekness of [[the Ventures]], the lyric sophistication of Chuck Berry, and the vocal expertise of some weird cross between [[the Lettermen]] and [[Frankie Lymon]] and [[the Teenagers]]&quot; with lyrics whos images, idioms, and concerns were drawn from the rarefied world of the middle-class white male southern California teenager. … [But] it was the profound vocal virtuosity of the group, coupled with the obsessional drive and compositional ambitions of their leader, Brian Wilson, that promised their survival after the eventual breaking of fad fever. … Comparison to other vocally oriented rock groups, such as [[the Association]], shows the Beach Boys' technique to be far superior, almost embarrassingly so. They were so confident of their ability, and of Brian's skill as a producer to enhance it, that they were unafraid of doing sophisticated, [[a cappella]] glee-club arrangements containing multiple [[suspension (music)|suspension]]s, passing [[musical form|formations]], complex chords, and both [[chromatic]] and [[enharmonic]] [[modulation (music)|modulations]].{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=34}}}}

[[File:The Beach Boys TV.jpg|thumb|The Beach Boys performing in 1964]]

Influenced by [[doo-wop]] and [[rhythm and blues]], they began as a [[garage band]] playing 1950s style [[rock and roll]].{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=15}} During their early years, the Beach Boys released music that displayed an increasing level of sophistication, a period where Brian Wilson consistently acted as the group's primary bandleader, songwriter, producer, and arranger for the group's most commercially and critically successful work.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|pp=105–7}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis1990&quot;/&gt; Together, the band reassembled styles of music such as [[surf music|surf]] to include [[vocal jazz]] [[jazz harmony|harmony]], creating their unique sound.{{sfn|MacFarlane|2008|p=36}}{{sfn|Zager|2011|p=216}} In addition, they introduced their signature approach to common genres such as the [[pop ballad]] by applying harmonic or formal twists not native to rock and roll.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=35}} Miller observed, &quot;On straight rockers they sang tight harmonies behind Love's lead  … on ballads, Brian played his [[falsetto]] off against lush, [[jazz]]-tinged voicings, often using (for rock) unorthodox harmonic structures.&quot;{{sfn|Miller|1992|p=194}} Harrison adds, &quot;But even the least distinguished of the Beach Boys' early uptempo rock 'n' roll songs show traces of structural complexity at some level; Brian was simply too curious and experimental to leave convention alone.&quot;{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=34}} This new sound was quickly associated with the [[modernism (music)|Modernism]] movement blooming in the Los Angeles music scene.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=16}} The band later went on to incorporate many [[genres]], from [[baroque pop]] to [[psychedelic rock|psychedelia]] and [[synthpop]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AllMusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Beach Boys Biography on All Music.com|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3640|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|last=Bush|first=John|accessdate=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1964, Brian began his breakaway from beach-themed music.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=28}} Later in November of the same year, the group expressed desires to advance from the surf rock style for which they initially became known for.&lt;ref name=Welch1964/&gt; Experimentation with [[psychotropic]] substances proved pivotal to the group's development as artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Griffiths|first1=David|title=Dennis Wilson: &quot;I Live With 17 Girls&quot;|journal=Record Mirror|date=December 21, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=58}} The following month, Brian was introduced to [[cannabis]] before quickly progressing to [[LSD]] in early 1965. Of his first [[psychedelic experience|acid trip]],{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=65}} Brian recalled that the drug had subjected him to &quot;a very religious experience&quot; which enlightened him to indescribable philosophies.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=136}} The music for &quot;[[California Girls]]&quot;, the first Beach Boys song which [[Bruce Johnston]] participated in,{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=105}} came from this first LSD experience,{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=65}} as did much of the group's subsequent work where they would often partake in drug use during recording sessions.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=276}}

Brian is quoted saying: &quot;Everyone contributed something. Carl kept us hip to the latest tunes, Al taught us his repertoire of folk songs, and Dennis, though he didn't [initially] play anything, added a combustible spark just by his presence.&quot;{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} Early on, Love sang lead vocals in the rock-oriented songs, while Carl contributed crisp guitar lines on the group's ballads.{{sfn|Miller|1992|p=194}} In a 1966 article which asks &quot;Do the Beach Boys rely too much on sound genius Brian?&quot;, Carl responded that every member of the group contributes ideas, but admitted that Brian was majorly responsible for their music.{{sfn|Priore|2005}}

===Influences===
The band's earliest influences came primarily from the work of [[Chuck Berry]]{{refn|group=nb|&quot;[[Surfin' U.S.A. (song)|Surfin' U.S.A.]]&quot; is a variation of Berry's &quot;[[Sweet Little Sixteen]]&quot;.{{sfn|Curtis|1987|p=105}} Under pressure from Berry's publisher, Wilson's father and manager, [[Murry Wilson]], had given the copyright, including Brian Wilson's lyrics, to Arc Music.&lt;ref&gt;Pegg, Bruce. ''Brown Eyed Handsome Man'' (2002): 162-163&lt;/ref&gt;}} and [[the Four Freshmen]].{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=16}} Performed by the Four Freshmen, &quot;[[Their Hearts Were Full of Spring]]&quot; (1961) was a particular favorite of the group.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|pp=34, 54}} By deconstructing their arrangements of [[pop standards]], Brian educated himself on [[jazz harmony]].{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=5}} Taking this into mind, Philip Lambert noted, &quot;If [[Bob Flanigan (singer)|Bob Flanigan]] helped teach Brian how to sing, then [[George Gershwin|Gershwin]], [[Jerome Kern|Kern]], [[Cole Porter|Porter]], and the other members of this pantheon helped him learn how to craft a song.&quot;{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=6}}  Other general influences on the group included [[the Hi-Los]],{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=16}}{{refn|group=nb|The Four Freshmen and the Hi-Los which were [[vocal group]]s who appropriated their modern jazz progressions from the trio [[Lambert, Hendricks &amp; Ross]].{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=16}}}} [[the Penguins]], [[the Robins]], [[Bill Haley &amp; His Comets]], [[Otis Williams]], [[the Cadets (doo wop)|the Cadets]], [[the Everly Brothers]], [[the Belmonts]], [[the Shirelles]], [[the Regents]], and [[the Crystals]].{{sfn|Lambert|2007|pp=14–15}}{{refn|group=nb|In 1967, [[Lou Reed]] of [[the Velvet Underground]] wrote in ''[[Aspen (magazine)|Aspen]]'' that the Beach Boys created a &quot;hybrid sound&quot; out of old rock and the Four Freshmen, explaining that such songs as &quot;[[Let Him Run Wild]]&quot;, &quot;[[Don't Worry Baby]]&quot;, &quot;[[I Get Around]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Fun, Fun, Fun]]&quot; were not unlike &quot;Peppermint Stick&quot; by the Elchords.{{sfn|Unterberger|2009|p=122}} Similarly, [[John Sebastian]] of [[the Lovin' Spoonful]] noted, &quot;Brian had control of this vocal palette of which we had no idea. We had never paid attention to the Four Freshmen or doo-wop combos like [[the Crew Cuts]]. Look what gold he mined out of that.&quot;{{sfn|Dillon|2012}} }} While the Beach Boys are not often associated with [[blues]], Brian has called this a misapprehension, citing [[Smokey Robinson]] and [[Stevie Wonder]] as influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Head' Games With Brian Wilson|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/67452/head-games-with-brian-wilson|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 8, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding surf rock pioneer [[Dick Dale]], Brian clarified that his influence on the group was limited to Carl and his style of guitar playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaquarian.com/2005/08/10/brian-wilson-interview-with-brian-wilson/|title=Interview with Brian Wilson|publisher=theaquarian.com|accessdate=November 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Brian quoted in September 1965: &quot;I HATE so-called 'surfin' music.” It’s a name that people slap on any sound from California.

The influence of the Beach Boys' peers combined with Brian's competitive nature drove him to reach higher creative peaks.{{sfn|Zak|2001|p=88}}{{refn|group=nb|The Beach Boys and the Beatles are often stated to have directly reciprocated each others' musical developments during the 1960s. Echoing this, Beatles producer [[George Martin]] indicated &quot;no one made a greater impact on the Beatles than Brian [Wilson].&quot;{{sfn|Jones|2008|pp=56–57}} }} Sometime around late 1963, he heard the song &quot;[[Be My Baby]]&quot; (1963) by [[the Ronettes]] for the first time, revamping his creative interests and songwriting.{{sfn|Brown|2008|p=185}} &quot;Be My Baby&quot; is considered the epitome of [[Phil Spector]]'s [[Wall of Sound]] production technique, a recording method that would fascinate Wilson for the next several decades.{{sfn|Howard|2004|pp=56–57}} Brian later reflected: &quot;I was unable to really think as a producer up until the time where I really got familiar with Phil Spector's work. That was when I started to design the experience to be a record rather than just a song.&quot;{{sfn|Leaf|1978|p=73}}{{refn|group=nb|[[Barney Hoskyns]] has speculated, &quot;It was almost certainly [[Bob Norberg|[Bob] Norberg]] who turned Brian on to the productions of Phil Spector.&quot;{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=63}} }} He kept &quot;Be My Baby&quot; on his living room jukebox, and would listen to it whenever the mood struck him.{{refn|group=nb|At one point, he instructed engineer [[Stephen Desper]] to create a [[tape loop]] consisting only of the song's chorus, listening to it for several hours in what Desper saw as &quot;some kind of a [[trance]]&quot;.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=160}} The Beach Boys recorded cover versions of several songs penned by Spector, including &quot;[[Then I Kissed Her]]&quot;, &quot;[[There's No Other (Like My Baby)]]&quot;, &quot;[[Chapel of Love]]&quot;, &quot;[[Just Once in My Life]]&quot;, &quot;[[You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin']]&quot;,{{sfn|Lambert|2007|pp=346, 359}} and &quot;[[I Can Hear Music]]&quot;.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=385}}  [[The Beach Boys' Christmas Album]] (1964) was released as a response to [[Phil Spector's Christmas Album]] (1963).{{sfn|Lambert|2007|pp=168–169}} }} According to engineer [[Larry Levine]], &quot;Brian was one of the few people in the music business Phil respected. There was a mutual respect. Brian might say that he learned how to produce from watching Phil, but the truth is, he was already producing records before he observed Phil. He just wasn't getting credit for it, something that in the early days, I remember really used to make Phil angry. Phil would tell anybody who listened that Brian was one of the great producers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Levine1997&quot;/&gt;

Other prominent inspirations for Brian included Gershwin's &quot;[[Rhapsody in Blue]]&quot; (1924),{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=10}} [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' (1965),{{refn|group=nb|Of the Beatles, Brian identified the main difference between his music approach to theirs is that they simplify songs to their &quot;skeletal form,&quot; whereas he would be &quot;impelled to make [them] more complex,&quot; and that if he had arranged &quot;[[Norwegian Wood]]&quot;, he would have &quot;orchestrated it, put in background voices, [and] done a thousand things&quot;.{{sfn|Fusilli|2005|p=80}} }} and composer [[Burt Bacharach]].{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=64}} Author Domenic Priore wrote that, in a subtle way, Brian grew to appreciate the potential of what a pop song could do after being partially spurred on by the dynamics of Bacharach's &quot;[[Walk On By (Burt Bacharach and Hal David song)|Walk On By]]&quot; (1964), a song which would become just as influential to him as &quot;Be My Baby&quot;, supporting his strive to achieve a sense of dynamics in his recordings while he began pulling away from a purely Spector-inspired approach to production.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=29}} Brian supported this by saying, &quot;Burt Bacharach and [[Hal David]] are more like me. They’re also the best pop team – per se – today. As a producer, Bacharach has a very fresh, new approach.&quot;{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=64}}{{refn|group=nb|The Beach Boys covered &quot;[[My Little Red Book]]&quot; and &quot;[[Walk On By (song)|Walk On By]]&quot; in 1967 and 1968 but left the recordings unreleased.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|pp=284, 352, 354–355}}}}

===Vocal ability===
Brian identified each member individually for their [[vocal range]], once detailing the ranges for Carl, Dennis, Jardine (&quot;[they] progress upwards through G, A, and B&quot;) Love (&quot;can go from bass to the E above middle C&quot;), and himself (&quot;I can take the second D in the [[treble clef]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;PopGenius&quot;/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|Starting with the 1970 sessions for the ''Surf's Up'' album, Stephen Desper remembers the emerging corrosive effects of Brian's incessant [[chain smoking]] and [[cocaine]] use: &quot;He could still do falsettos and stuff, but he'd need Carl to help him. Either that or I'd modify the tape speed-wise to make it artificially higher, so it sounded like the old days.&quot;{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=160}} }} He declared in 1966 that his greatest interest was to expand modern vocal harmony, owing his fascination with voice to the Four Freshmen which he considered a &quot;groovy sectional sound&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PopGenius&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Brian Pop Genius!|journal=Melody Maker|date=May 21, 1966|url=http://i1218.photobucket.com/albums/dd420/kwan_dk/MMMay211966.jpg}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added, &quot;The harmonies that we are able to produce give us a uniqueness which is really the only important thing you can put into records – some quality that no one else has got. I love peaks in a song – and enhancing them on the control panel. Most of all, I love the human voice for its own sake.&quot;{{sfn|Moorefield|2010|p=17}}&lt;ref name=&quot;PopGenius&quot;/&gt; Rock critic [[Erik Davis]] wrote, &quot;The 'purity' of tone and genetic proximity that smoothed their voices was almost creepy, pseudo-[[castrato]], [and] a '[[barbershop music|barbershop]]' sound.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis1990&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Erik|title=Look!

From lowest [[interval (music)|intervals]] to highest, the group's vocal harmony stack usually began with Love or Dennis, followed by Jardine or Carl, and finally Brian on top.&lt;ref name=Sharp2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sharp|first1=Ken|title=Al Jardine of the Beach Boys: Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About &quot;SMiLE&quot; (Interview)|url=http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2013/04/02/al-jardine-smile-beach-boys-interview/|website=Rock Cellar Magazine|accessdate=2 July 2014|date=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jardine explains, &quot;We always sang the same vocal intervals. … As soon as we heard the chords on the piano we’d figure it out pretty easily. If there was a vocal move [Brian] envisioned, he’d show that particular singer that move. We had somewhat photographic memory as far as the vocal parts were concerned so that never a problem for us.&quot;&lt;ref name=Sharp2013/&gt; Striving for absolute perfection, Brian's intricate vocal arrangements exercised the group's calculated blend of [[intonation (music)|intonation]], [[attack (music)|attack]], [[phrase (music)|phrasing]], and [[musical expression|expression]].{{sfn|Moorefield|2010|pp=17–19}} Sometimes, he would sing each vocal harmony part alone through multi-track tape.{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=106}} [[Jimmy Webb]] has said, &quot;They used very little [[vibrato]] and sing in very straight tones. The voices all lie down beside each other very easily – there's no bumping between them because the pitch is very precise.&quot;{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=65}}

===As instrumentalists===
The group's instrumental combo initially involved Brian on bass guitar and keyboards, Carl on guitar, and Dennis on drums.{{sfn|Zager|2011|pp=215–16}} From an early age, Brian demonstrated an extraordinary skill for [[learning music by ear]] on keyboard.{{sfn|Lambert|2007|pp=2, 8}} Using major Hollywood [[recording studio]]s, he arranged many of his compositions for a conglomerate of [[session musician]]s informally known as [[the Wrecking Crew (music)|the Wrecking Crew]] due to the increasingly complicated nature of the material.{{sfn|Trynka|Bacon|1996|p=127}}{{refn|group=nb|Many of the musicians and studios Brian used happened to overlap with those used by Phil Spector.{{sfn|Zak|2001|p=88}} }} As a result, a number of songs do not credit the Beach Boys as instrumentalists, but nearly invariably as lead, harmony, or backing vocalists.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} It's the belief of [[Richie Unterberger]] that &quot;before session musicians took over most of the parts, the Beach Boys could play respectably gutsy surf rock as a self-contained unit.&quot;{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=71}} In spite of this, Carl Wilson continued to play beside these musicians whenever he was available to attend sessions.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=114}} In archivist Craig Slowinski's view, &quot;One should not sell short Carl's own contributions; the youngest Wilson had developed as a musician sufficiently to play alongside the horde of high-dollar session pros that big brother was now bringing into the studio. Carl's guitar playing [was] a key ingredient.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tiptopwebsite.com/custommusic2/craigslowinskicom.pdf#page=42 |title= The Beach Boys - The Beach Boys Today! |first= Craig|last=Slowinski|year=2007 |accessdate=October 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian's experiments with his Wollensack tape recorder provide early examples of his flair for [[exotica]] and unusual percussive patterns and arranging ideas that he would recycle in later prominent work.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=23}} Through attending Phil Spector's sessions sporadically, Brian learned how to act as a producer for records while being educated on the [[Wall of Sound]] process.{{sfn|Moorefield|2010|p=17}} From then on, Brian received some production advice from [[Jan Berry]]. As they collaborated on several hit singles written and produced for other artists, they recorded what would later be regarded the [[California Sound]].{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=24}}{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=57}} The positive commercial response to Brian's structurally irregular and harmonically varied pop compositions gave him the prestige, resources, and courage to further his creative aspirations.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|pp=36–37}} He proceeded to explore many unusual combinations of instruments while emphasizing inventive percussion and progressively ambitious lyricism.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|pp=36–38}}{{sfn|Miller|1992|pp=194–95}}

Although he was often dubbed a perfectionist, Brian was an inexperienced musician, and his understanding was mostly self-taught.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|pp=105, 114}}{{refn|group=nb|In his youth, Brian received a six-week lesson on how to play the [[accordion]].{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=11}} According to the Wilsons' mother, &quot;The teacher said, 'I don't think he's reading. He hears it just once and plays the whole thing perfectly.'&quot;{{sfn|Lambert|2007|p=2}} While majoring in [[psychology]] at the [[El Camino College|El Camino Community College]] in Los Angeles, he took additional music classes.{{sfn|Badman|2004|p=15}} }} He handled most stages of the group's recording process from the beginning, despite [[Nik Venet]] being credited for producing their early recordings.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=105}}{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=26}} With regards to Brian's mid 1960s productions, ethnomusicologist [[David Toop]] characterized his style as &quot;[[cartoon]] music and [[Disney]] influence mutating into [[avant-garde music|avant-garde pop]]&quot;.{{sfn|Toop|1995|p=114}} Before 1966, Brian's mastery of songwriting proved that he was capable of applying odd [[chord progression|harmonic progression]]s, unexpected disruptions of [[hypermeter]],{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=3}} [[jazz harmony|jazz theory]],&lt;ref name=JazzTheory /&gt; [[Metric modulation|tempo changes]], [[Meter (music)|metrical ambiguity]], and unusual [[tone color]]s successfully within a pop context.{{sfn|Perone|2012|p=28}} He made on-the-spot decisions about [[note]]s, [[articulation (music)|articulation]], and [[timbre]]; composing at the mixing board and using the studio as a musical instrument.{{sfn|Moorefield|2010|p=17}} Despite this, in most cases he was forced to rely on outside collaborators when it came to adding lyricism to his compositions. It was at this stage that Brian usually worked with bandmate [[Mike Love]]{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=73}} whose assertive persona provided youthful swagger that contrasted Brian's explorations in romanticism and sensitivity.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=108}} Luis Sanchez noted a pattern where Brian would spare surfing imagery when working with collaborators outside of his band's circle in the examples &quot;[[Lonely Sea]]&quot; and &quot;[[In My Room]]&quot;.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=27}}

He preferred mixing live as performances were recorded, as opposed to mixing after the fact.{{sfn|Trynka|Bacon|1996|p=127}} He was open to changes suggested by others while recording, often taking advice and even incorporating apparent mistakes if they provided a useful or interesting alternative.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=114}}{{sfn|Everett|2008}} He experimented with processed effects including [[varispeed]], [[reverberation]], [[delay (audio effect)|slapback echo]], and filtering signals through a [[Leslie speaker]].{{sfn|Everett|2008|pp=341, 351}} Lyric collaborator [[Tony Asher]] remembers that in the 1960s: &quot;People would try whatever they could think of that was unexpected, just for its own sake...spend three days and call in a bunch of oboe players. Try an instrument just because nobody had ever used it, and in the end, it wasn't in the final mix. That never happened with Brian. He did the same kind of experimenting, not to see if he could accidentally stumble onto something unique, but he did these unique things because that's what he wanted to hear. And most of the time, it ended up on the record.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tony Asher interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Asher|first=Tony|title=Tony Asher interview|url=http://www.albumlinernotes.com/Tony_Asher_Interview.html|accessdate=December 26, 2014|website=Album Liner Notes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once an instrumental track was completed, vocals would then be [[overdub]]bed by the group.{{sfn|Tunbridge|2010|p=173}} On ''[[Surfin' U.S.A.]]'' (1963), Brian began [[doubletracking]].{{sfn|Trynka|Bacon|1996|p=126}} As was practiced by other record producers from the 1960s, most of his mixes ended up in single-channel [[monaural]],{{sfn|Everett|2008|p=359}} believing that varied stereo speaker placement took his control over the sound image away to the listener.{{sfn|Zak|2001|p=148}}

Eschewing [[Capitol Studios]] which Brian considered inadequate,{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=55}}{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=65}}{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=9}} engineer [[Chuck Britz]] often collaborated with him at Western 3 of [[United Western Recorders]],{{sfn|Cogan|Clark|2003|p=32}} also serving as a buffer between Brian and the oft-berating Murry whenever he was present.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|pp=105–6}} Once Britz assembled a preliminary recording setup, Brian would take over the console, directing the instrumentalists from the booth using an intercom or verbal gestures after supplying them with [[chord chart]]s which were sometimes written incorrectly.{{sfn|Moorefield|2010|p=19}} It's reported that even though Britz was responsible for setting up recording, Brian would then adjust his configuration to a large extent.{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=81}} Asher adds: &quot;As unorganized or even unproductive as he [Brian] could be in other situations, when he got into a recording session, you had the sense he had ideas that were gonna get away from him if he didn't get 'em done right away. He was willing to have people be relaxed and joke a little bit, but he wanted to get work done. And he sometimes lost his temper just a little bit if Chuck couldn't find a take.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tony Asher interview&quot; /&gt; At [[Gold Star Studios]], Brian worked mainly with engineers [[Stan Ross (studio executive)|Stan Ross]] and, with lesser frequency, Larry Levine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Levine1997&quot;&gt;{{cite AV media notes|first=|last=|authorlink=|chapter=Musician Comments: Larry Levine|title=The Pet Sounds Sessions|others=The Beach Boys|year=1997|publisher=[[Capitol Records]]|type=Booklet|chapter-url=http://albumlinernotes.com/Larry_Levine.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ross said of Brian, &quot;[he] liked the sound Gold Star got on the instrumentation, but he did the voices elsewhere because we were limited to two or three tracks and that wasn't enough for voice overdubbing. ...

But when you've only got 4 or 5 or a small number of voices, everything's audible, and there's nothing to distract people's ear from what you're writing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tony Asher interview&quot; /&gt; Session bassist [[Carol Kaye]] noted, &quot;We had to create [instrumental] parts for all the other groups we cut for, but not Brian. We were in awe of Brian.&quot;{{sfn|Howard|2004|p=58}} Friend [[Danny Hutton]] expressed similar feelings while highlighting Brian's studio proficiency, citing what he believed to be an extraordinary talent at harnessing several different studio spaces while piecing together discrete instrumental patterns and timbres cohesively. He noted, &quot;Somebody could go in right after Brian’s session and try to record, and they could never get the sound he got. There was a lot of subtle stuff he did. … People don’t talk that much about it. They always talk about his music. He was fabulous in the studio, in terms of getting sounds. You’d sit there, and that was him. He was just hands-on. He would change the [[reverb]] and the echo, and all of a sudden, something just – ''whoa!'' – got twice as big and fat.&quot;{{sfn|Priore|2005|pp=55, 80}}

Foreshadowed by ''Beach Boys' Party!'' (1965), much of the group's recordings from 1967–1970 displayed sparse instrumentation, a more relaxed ensemble, and a seeming inattention to production quality.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|pp=41, 46}} Brian briefly experimented with ''[[musique concrete]]''{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=70}} and [[minimalist music|minimalist rock]] approaches to music{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=47}} before retreating to [[Brian Wilson's home studio|his home recording studio]] to record &quot;manic&quot; material in the 1970s, enacting [[syncopation|syncopated exercises]] and [[counterpoint]]s layered on jittery [[eighth note]] [[tone cluster]]s and loping [[Swing (jazz performance style)|shuffle grooves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chidester|first=Brian|title=Brian Wilson's Secret Bedroom Tapes|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2014-01-30/music/brian-wilsons-secret-bedroom-tapes/|accessdate=February 1, 2014|newspaper=LA Weekly|date=January 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the infancy of Brian's home studio, the group was forced to improvise many technical aspects of recording.

When Brian abdicated from the group, the other members were forced to take a more active production role.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=46}} This is believed to have faltered the quality of their music.{{sfn|Guinn|2014|p=130}} [[Richie Unterberger]] believes that after the December 1967 release of ''Wild Honey'', &quot;the Beach Boys were revealed as a group that, although capable of producing some fine and interesting music, were no longer innovators on the level of the Beatles and other figureheads.&quot;{{sfn|Bogdanov|Woodstra|Erlewine|2002|p=72}} The album marked the beginning of Carl's increased role as producer, who described it as &quot;music for Brian to cool out by,&quot;{{sfn|Gaines|1986|p=184}} signaling a mellower approach which would pervade into the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis1990&quot;/&gt; In 1968, Dennis contributed original songs to ''Friends'', revealing himself as a broodingly soulful songwriter and singer, while Bruce Johnston devised a moody instrumental, &quot;The Nearest Faraway Place&quot;,  for ''20/20'' the following year.{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=120–21}} ''[[Sunflower (The Beach Boys album)|Sunflower]]'' (1970) marked an end to the experimental songwriting and production phase initiated by ''[[Smiley Smile]]'' (1967).{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=52}} Of the albums between ''[[Surf's Up (album)|Surf's Up]]'' (1971) and ''Holland'' (1973), Daniel Harrison wrote that they &quot;contain a mixture of middle-of-the-road music entirely consonant with pop style during the early 1970s with a few oddities that proved that the desire to push beyond conventional boundaries was not dead.&quot;{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=52}} While Harrison adamantly states &quot;1974 is the year in which the Beach Boys ceased to be a rock 'n' roll act and became an oldies act,&quot;{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=52}} ''[[Love You (album)|Love You]]'' (1977) is perceived by some as an oddity that sounds like no other record in their catalog&lt;ref name=&quot;Kempke&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Kempke|first=D.

Regarded by some critics as one of the greatest American rock groups and an important catalyst in the evolution of popular music, the Beach Boys are one of the most critically acclaimed and [[list of best-selling musical artists|commercially successful bands of all time]].&lt;ref name=RockHallofFame /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Greatest Artists: The Beach Boys|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/the-beach-boys-19691231|publisher=Rolling Stone|last=Buckingham|first=Lindsey|accessdate=October 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Beach Boys' sales estimates range from 100 to 350 million records worldwide, and have influenced artists spanning many genres and decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2306391/Lost-Beach-Boys-lyrics-music-photographs-expected-sell-10m-lying-Florida-storage-unit-years.html|title=Lost treasure trove of Beach Boys lyrics, music and photographs expected to sell for $10m after lying in storage unit for years|date=April 9, 2013|first=Harriet|last=Arkell|work=[[Daily Mail]]|accessdate=April 13, 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group's early songs made them major pop stars in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and other countries, having sixteen hit singles between 1962 and 1965.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} They were one of the few American bands formed prior to the 1964 [[British Invasion]] to continue their success.{{sfn|Curtis|1987|p=101}} Among artists of the 1960s, they are one of few central figures in the histories of rock.{{sfn|Jones|2008|p=56}} Their early hits helped raise the profile of the state of California, creating its first major regional style with national significance, and establishing a musical identity for [[Southern California]], as opposed to [[Hollywood]].{{sfn|Curtis|1987|p=103}} This also associated the band with surfing, [[hot-rod]] racing, and a contemporaneous teenage lifestyle and fantasy.{{sfn|Perone|2004|p=21}}{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|pp=62–64}}{{sfn|Miller|1992|pp=192–94}} There had been surf bands formed prior to the Beach Boys, but none which projected a world view as the Beach Boys did.{{sfn|Miller|1992|p=193}}

Brian's work is credited as a major innovation in the field of music production.{{sfn|Moorefield|2010|p=16}} According to [[Erik Davis]], &quot;Not only did the Beach Boys write a soundtrack to the early '60s, but Brian let loose a delicate and joyful [[art pop]] unique in music history and presaged the mellowness so fundamental to '70s California pop.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis1990&quot;/&gt; ''[[The A.V.

====Reappraisal====

Professor of cultural studies James M. Curtis wrote in 1987,

{{quote| … we can say that the Beach Boys represent the outlook and values of [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|white Protestant Anglo-Saxon]] teenagers in the early sixties. Having said that, we immediately realize that they must mean much more than this. Their stability, their staying power, and their ability to attract new fans prove as much.{{sfn|Curtis|1987|p=101}} }}

[[File:The Beach Boys (1965).png|thumb|left|The Beach Boys in a promotional shot used for their 1965 single &quot;[[California Girls]]&quot;]]

Throughout their career, the Beach Boys struggled with their public image and audiences.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=61–63, 122, 138}}{{sfn|Gaines|1986|pp=154, 179}}{{sfn|Dillon|2012}}{{sfn|Guinn|2014|p=130–31}}{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=25}} Musicologist [[Charlie Gillett]] explains, &quot;By 1965, the Beach Boys had become an American pop institution, but although they continued to cultivate a visual image in line with their name and early repertoire, there was a limit to how many different ways Wilson could celebrate the wonders of living in Southern California … Originally, many serious pop fans dismissed the group as trashy pop for kids, the Beach Boys began to attract wide admiration just as Brian Wilson found the strain of public adulation more than he had bargained for; retreating from live performances, Wilson spent most of his time in the recording studio, constructing the songs.&quot;{{sfn|Gillett|1996|p=328–29}} Their growing complexity caused their live performances to suffer in the mid 1960s, when the group began to be derided by audiences for their uniformed striped shirts{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=97}} compounded by low key reproductions of songs which demanded complicated orchestrations.{{sfn|Badman|2005|p=187}} In their earliest public appearances, the band wore heavy wool jacket-like shirts which were favored by local surfers{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=19}} before switching to their trademark striped shirts and white pants{{sfn|Badman|2005|p=187}}{{sfn|Schinder|2007|p=106}} inspired by [[the Kingston Trio]].{{sfn|Sanchez|2010|p=92}} In the latter half of the decade, the Beach Boys promoted [[anti-war]] activism,{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=234}} [[Transcendental Meditation]]{{sfn|Perone|2004|p=151}}{{sfn|Hoskyns|2009|p=156}} and [[environmentalism]]. In 1970, the group ceased wearing matching uniforms on stage and began emphasizing political and social awareness.{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=155}}{{sfn|Perone|2004|pp=8, 16–17}} Drawing from their associations with [[Charles Manson]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], Erik Davis observed, &quot;the Beach Boys may be the only bridge between those deranged poles. There is a wider range of political and aesthetic sentiments in their records than in any other band in those heady times—like the state [of California], they expand and bloat and contradict themselves.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis1990&quot;/&gt;

Peter Ames Carlin noted that while the Beach Boys' contemporaries grew more intellectually aware, &quot;Capitol continued to bill them as 'America’s Top Surfin' Group!' Their TV appearances still took place on sets dressed with surfboards, beach balls, and chicks doing the twist in candy-colored bikinis. And when the summer sales season neared, everyone still expected Brian to crank out another batch of ready-made tunes set on the beaches, highways, and backseats he’d long since lost interest in describing.&quot;{{sfn|Carlin|2006|p=62}} He adds, &quot;Clearly, the group’s disconnect from the cultural avant-garde was not all Capitol’s doing or even entirely a product of the group’s own commercial motivations. Bear in mind that the Beach Boys themselves were still college-aged, only none of them had been to college, nor (with the possible exception of Brian) had they shown much discernible interest in what you might call the world of ideas. … This makes the humanities students among us slap our foreheads and moan with sorrow.&quot;{{sfn|Carlin|2006|pp=62–63}} Collaborator [[Van Dyke Parks]] has spoken that he and Brian were conscious of the counterculture, and that the two had felt estranged from it, but also that it was necessary to adhere to due to a willingness to &quot;get out of the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]] mindset.&quot;{{sfn|Priore|2005|p=39}} Parks stresses, &quot;At the same time, he didn't want to lose that kind of gauche sensibility that he had. He was doing stuff that nobody would dream of doing. You would never, for example, use one string on a banjo when you had five; it just wasn't done.

Despite the group's immense popularity and success, some consider that the extent of their contribution to Western music canon is undervalued. In 1967, [[Lou Reed]] famously wrote, &quot;Will none of the powers that be realize what Brian Wilson did with ''the chords''?&quot;{{sfn|Unterberger|2009|p=122}} [[Pitchfork Media]] posited, &quot;At some point, you learn that the Beach Boys weren't just a fun 1960s surf band with a run of singles that later came to be used in commercials; at their best, they were making capital-A Art. … Once you've absorbed  [''Pet Sounds''], you find yourself going back through songs like &quot;[[Don't Worry Baby]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Warmth of the Sun]]&quot;, and &quot;[[I Get Around]]&quot;, finding a deeper brilliance where you once heard only pop craftsmanship.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richardson|first=Mark|title=The Smile Sessions review|journal=Pitchfork|date=November 2, 2011 |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16000-the-smile-sessions/|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discussing the 2011 release of ''The Smile Sessions'', ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, &quot;…certainly every library of American recording history needs this; university composition departments, music professors, budding recording engineers and composers should study it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Randall|title='Smile Sessions' reveals creation|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/nov/06/entertainment/la-ca-beach-boys-smile-notebook-20111106/2|accessdate=July 2, 2014|agency=The Los Angeles Times|date=November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online publication ''[[NewMusicBox]]'' – which normally devotes itself to new American music that is outside the commercial mainstream – argued,

{{quote|[Will the] carefully reassembled reconstruction of the lost ''Smile'' album finally earn Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys the same pride of place in American music history held by other great innovators like, say,  [[Charles Ives|Ives]], [[George Gershwin|Gershwin]], [[John Cage|Cage]], [[John Coltrane|Coltrane]], [[James Brown]], etc.? Sadly, probably not. But this has more to do with the vagaries of reception history than with actual history. For many people, the Beach Boys will always be perceived as a light-hearted party band that drooled over &quot;[[California Girls]]&quot; while on a &quot;[[Surfin' Safari|Surfing Safari]]&quot;. That image of the group has not been helped by the endless recycling of their greatest hits on recording compilations, their latter-day cover-band-version-of-their-former-selves concert appearances, and the lasting presence of these early songs as the soundtracks for countless commercials over the years encouraging revelers to have some &quot;Summer Fun.&quot;&lt;ref name=Oteri2011&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oteri|first1=Frank J.|title=Sounds Heard: The Beach Boys—The Smile Sessions|url=http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/sounds-heard-the-beach-boys-the-smile-sessions/|website=New Music Box|accessdate=July 2, 2014|date=December 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The group's legitimacy in rock music is an oft-repeated criticism toward the band.{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=18, 33–36}} Luis Sanchez refers to &quot;one of the smuggest accounts of the Beach Boys' music&quot; in an essay written by Mark Sten for the book ''Rock Almanac: Top Twenty American and British Singles and Albums of the '50s, '60s and '70s'' where Sten denounces the group for celebrating a &quot;politically unconscious youth culture.&quot; He writes of their hot rod and surfing themes, &quot;the Klean Kut Kar Krazy Kalifornia Kwintet finally came out and said it, embracing the high school status quo and generally coming off as mindless hedonistic reactionaries. Well, shit, it mattered to me.&quot;{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|p=34}} Sanchez responds, &quot;It is one of The Beach Boys' enduring legacies that, for all the wresting of creative proprietorship, you can’t ignore the line of corniness running through their music. But what does that mean? If only they had had a better sense of their position as rock revolutionaries, they wouldn't have made the music they did, much less music that reflects what a critic like Sten finds too quaint and reactionary?&quot; Sanchez argues that it's typical of a &quot;rockist&quot; outlook to create prevalence on &quot;an apparent lack of commitment to a code of authenticity than to risk taking the music at face value, to consider what it is that might make it distinct and worthy simply as music.&quot;{{sfn|Sanchez|2014|pp=35–36}}

Daniel Harrison contests that the group produced work which could &quot;almost&quot; be considered art music in the Western classical tradition, and that group's innovations in the musical language of rock can be compared to those that introduced [[atonality|atonal]] and other nontraditional techniques into that classical tradition. He explains, &quot;The spirit of experimentation is just as palpable in ''[[Smiley Smile]]'' as it is in, say, [[Schoenberg]]'s [[Drei Klavierstücke|op. 11 piano pieces]].&quot;{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=47}} While the group &quot;went into the great void beyond,&quot; such notions were not widely acknowledged by rock audiences nor by the classically-minded at the time.{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=59}} Harrison concludes: &quot;What influences could these innovations then have? The short answer is, not much. ''Smiley Smile'', ''Wild Honey'', ''Friends'', and ''20/20'' sound like few other rock albums; they are ''sui generis''. … It must be remembered that the commercial failure of the Beach Boys' experiments was hardly motivation for imitation. In the end, we must conclude that the Beach Boys' late-1960s experiments were not reproducible.&quot; Referring to the groups' reaction to the commercial success of their 1974 greatest hits compilation ''Endless Summer'', Harrison writes, &quot;they returned to the beach, knowing they would never leave it again.&quot;{{sfn|Harrison|1997|p=59}} Erik Davis wrote that by 1990, &quot;the Beach Boys are either dead, deranged, or dinosaurs; their records are Eurocentric, square, unsampled; they've made too much money to merit hip revisionism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis1990&quot;/&gt; From the same period, Jim Miller wrote, &quot;They have become a figment of their own past, prisoners of their unflagging popularity—incongruous emblems of a sunny myth of eternal youth belied by much of their own best music. … The group is still largely identified with its hits from the early Sixties.&quot;{{sfn|Miller|1992|pp=192, 195}}

The Wilsons' California house, where the Wilson brothers grew up and the group began, was demolished in 1986 to make way for [[Interstate 105 (California)|Interstate 105]], the Century Freeway.
