It is bordered by [[India]] to its west, north and east; [[Burma]] to its southeast and separated from [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]] by the [[Siliguri Corridor|Chicken’s Neck]] corridor. To its south, it faces the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Bangladesh is the world's [[List of countries by population|eighth-most populous country]], with over [[Demographics of Bangladesh|160 million people]], and among the [[List of countries by population density|most densely populated countries]]. It forms part of the ethno-linguistic region of [[Bengal]], along with the neighbouring Indian states of [[West Bengal]] and [[Tripura]].

The present-day borders of Bangladesh took shape during the [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Partition of Bengal]] and [[Partition of India|British India]] in 1947, when the [[East Bengal|region]] used to be known as [[East Pakistan]], as a part of the newly formed state of [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]]. It was separated from [[West Pakistan]] by 1,400&amp;nbsp;km of Indian territory. Due to political exclusion, ethnic and linguistic discrimination and economic neglect by the politically dominant western wing, [[Bengali nationalism|nationalism]], popular agitation and [[civil disobedience]] led to the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] and independence in 1971. After independence, the new state endured poverty, famine, political turmoil and [[Military coups in Bangladesh|military coups]]. The [[Bangladeshi constitutional referendum, 1991|restoration of democracy in 1991]] has been followed by relative calm and economic progress. In 2014, the Bangladeshi general election was boycotted by major opposition parties, resulting in a parliament and government dominated by the [[Awami League]] and its smaller coalition partners.

Bangladesh is a unitary [[parliamentary republic]] with an elected parliament called the [[Jatiyo Sangshad]]. The native [[Bengali people|Bengalis]] form the country's largest ethnic group, along with [[Ethnic groups in Bangladesh|indigenous peoples]] in northern and [[Chittagong Hill Tracts|southeastern]] districts. Geographically, the country is dominated by the fertile [[Bengal delta]], the world's largest delta. This also gives Bangladesh a unique name tag &quot;The land of rivers&quot;.

Bangladesh is a [[Next Eleven]] [[emerging economy]]. It has achieved significant strides in human and social development since independence, including in progress in gender equity, universal primary education, food production, health and population control.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Development Programme in Bangladesh: ''[http://www.undp.org.bd/info/events.php?newsid=734 HDR 2010 recognises Bangladesh's great progress over time]''. 5 November 2010.

Bangladesh is a founding member of [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation|SAARC]], the [[Developing 8 Countries]] and [[BIMSTEC]]. It contributes one of the largest [[Bangladesh UN Peacekeeping Force|peacekeeping forces]] to the [[United Nations peacekeeping|United Nations]]. It is a member of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the [[Organization of Islamic Cooperation]] and the [[Non-Aligned Movement]].

== Etymology == &lt;!--linked--&gt;

While the word &quot;Bengali&quot; ({{lang-bn|বাঙালি ''Bāṅgāli''}}) is generally used to refer to [[Bengali people|people of ethnic Bengali descent]], including those living in India and other  countries, the demonym &quot;[[Bangladeshi]]&quot; ({{lang-bn|বাংলাদেশী ''Bānlādēśī''}}) is being used to describe all citizens of Bangladesh, including non-Bengalis. The origin of the name [[Bengal]] (known as ''Bangla'' and ''Bongo'' in [[Bengali language]]) is unknown. One theory suggests that the word derives from &quot;Bang&quot;, a [[Dravidian peoples|Dravidian]] tribe that settled the region around 1000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+bd0014%29|title= Bangladesh: early history, 1000&amp;nbsp;B.C.–A.D. 1202 |date=September 1988 |work= Bangladesh: A country study|publisher=Library of Congress |location= Washington, D.C. |accessdate=1 December 2014|quote=Historians believe that Bengal, the area comprising present-day Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal, was settled in about 1000 B.C. by Dravidian-speaking peoples who were later known as the Bang. Their homeland bore various titles that reflected earlier tribal names, such as Vanga, Banga, Bangala, Bangal, and Bengal.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word might have been derived from the ancient [[Vanga Kingdom|kingdom of ''Vanga'']] (or ''Banga''), which came from the [[Austric]] word &quot;Bonga&quot; meaning the Sun-god.&lt;ref&gt;Scroll Paintings of Bengal: Art in the Village  by Amitabh Sengupta p.14&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indo-Aryan language|Indo-Aryan]] suffix &quot;''(-desh)''&quot; is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word  ''{{IAST|deśha-}}'' (&quot;region, province, country&quot;) (see [[Desi]]) means &quot;land&quot; or &quot;country&quot; in Bengali language, so ''Bangladesh'' means &quot;The land of Bengal&quot;.

The earliest reference to &quot;Vangala&quot; (''Bangla'') has been traced in the Nesari plates (805 AD) of [[Rashtrakuta]] [[Govinda III]] which speak of [[Dharmapala of Bengal|Dharmapala]] as the king of Vangala. The records of [[Rajendra Chola I]] of the [[Chola dynasty]], who invaded Bengal in the 11th century, speak of [[Govindachandra]] as the ruler of Vangaladesa.&lt;ref&gt;India: A History  by John Keay p.220&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge Shorter History of India p.145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Indian History and Civilization  by Sailendra Nath Sen p.281&lt;/ref&gt;

Remnants of [[civilization]] in the greater Bengal region date back four thousand years to when the region was settled by ancient [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]], [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]], [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]] and [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] peoples. The exact origin of the word &quot;Bangla&quot; or &quot;Bengal&quot; is unclear, though it is believed to be derived from ''Bang/Vanga'', the Dravidian-speaking tribe that settled in the area around the year 1000&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;congress&quot;&gt;{{cite book |publisher=Library of Congress |url=http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/bdtoc.html |chapter=Early History, 1000 B.C.-A.D. 1202 |title=Bangladesh: A country study |editor=James Heitzman and Robert L.

Publishing Corp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Islamic rule, the region came to be known to the Muslim world in Persian as ''Bangalah''.

The region was known to the ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] world{{cn|date=January 2015}} as ''[[Gangaridai]]'' or ''nation of Ganges''. Though still largely unclear, the early history of Bengal featured a succession of city states, maritime kingdoms and pan-Indian empires, as well as a tussle between Hinduism and Buddhism for dominance. The ancient political units of the region consisted of [[Vanga]], [[Samatata]], [[Harikela]] and [[Pundravardhana]]. The [[Mauryan Empire]] led by [[Ashoka the Great]] conquered Bengal in the second century BCE. After the collapse of the [[Gupta Empire]], a local ruler named [[Shashanka]] rose to power and founded the [[Gauḍa (city)|Gauda]] kingdom. After a [[Matsanayam|period of anarchy]], the Bengali [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Pala Empire|Pala dynasty]] ruled the region for four hundred years, followed by the Hindu [[Sena Dynasty]] and [[Candra Dynasty]].

[[Islam]] was introduced to the Bengal region during the 7th century by Arab Muslim traders and [[Sufism|Sufi]] missionaries, and the subsequent Muslim conquest of Bengal in the 12th century lead to the rooting of Islam across the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;eaton&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Eaton |first=R |year=1996 |title=The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-20507-3 |oclc=26634922 76881262}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bakhtiyar Khalji|Bakhtiar Khilji]], a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] general, defeated [[Lakshman Sen]] of the Sena dynasty and conquered large parts of Bengal in the year 1204.

The region was ruled by the [[Sultanate of Bengal]] and the [[Baro-Bhuiyan#Baro-Bhuyians of Bengal|Baro-Bhuiyan confederacy]] for the next few hundred years. By the 16th century, the [[Mughal Empire]] controlled Bengal, and Dhaka became an important provincial centre of Mughal administration.

Bengal was probably the wealthiest part of the subcontinent until the 16th century. From 1517 onwards, [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] traders from Goa were traversing the sea route to Bengal. Only in 1537 were they allowed to settle and open customs houses at Chittagong. In 1577, the Mughal emperor Akbar permitted the Portuguese to build permanent settlements and churches in Bengal.&lt;ref name=&quot;D'Costa&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The influence of European traders grew until the [[British East India Company]] gained control of Bengal following the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757.&lt;ref name=&quot;baxter&quot;&gt;Baxter&lt;/ref&gt; The bloody rebellion of 1857—known as the [[Sepoy Mutiny]]—resulted in a transfer of authority to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|crown]] with a British [[viceroy]] running the administration.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, pp. 30–32&lt;/ref&gt; During colonial rule, famine racked South Asia many times, including the war-induced [[Bengal famine of 1943|Great Bengal famine]] of 1943, which claimed 3&amp;nbsp;million lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;sen&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Sen |first=Amartya |year=1973 |title=Poverty and Famines |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-828463-2 |oclc=10362534 177334002 191827132 31051320 40394309 53621338 63294006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the foundation of the [[British Raj|British Indian Empire]], Bengal was still under the heavy influence of British culture including architecture and art. The [[Indian Independence Movement]] was still underway in effort to overthrow the British Empire, and many Bengali people contributed to that effort. At the same time as the Islamic and Hindu conflicts occurred, Bengal would be split into two states. Between 1905 and 1911, an [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|abortive attempt]] was made to divide the province of Bengal into two zones.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the exit of the [[British Empire]] in 1947, Bengal was [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|partitioned]] along religious lines, with the western part going to newly created [[India]] and the eastern part (Muslim majority) joining [[Pakistan]] as a province called [[East Bengal]] (later renamed [[East Pakistan]]), with Dhaka as its capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;collins&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Collins |first=L |author2=D Lapierre |year=1986 |title=Freedom at Midnight, Ed. 18 |publisher=Vikas Publishers, New Delhi |isbn=0-7069-2770-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:21 Feb 1953 Dhaka University female students procession.png|thumb|upright|[[Bengali Language Movement]]]]
In 1950, land reform was accomplished in East Bengal with the abolishment of the feudal [[zamindar]]i system.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the economic and demographic weight of the east, Pakistan's government and military were largely dominated by the upper classes from the west. The [[Bengali Language Movement]] of 1952 was the first sign of friction between the two wings of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt; Dissatisfaction with the central government over economic and cultural issues continued to rise through the next decade, during which the [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami League]] emerged as the political voice of the Bengali-speaking population. It agitated for [[Six point movement|autonomy]] in the 1960s, and in 1966, its president, [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] (Mujib), was jailed; he was released in 1969 after an unprecedented popular uprising. In 1970, a massive [[1970 Bhola cyclone|cyclone]] devastated the coast of East Pakistan, killing up to half a million people,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1483615/Bangladesh-cyclone-of-1991 Bangladesh cyclone of 1991]. Britannica Online Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; and the central government's response was seen as poor. The anger of the Bengali population was compounded when Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, whose [[Awami League]] had won a majority in Parliament in the 1970 elections,&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, pp. 78–79&lt;/ref&gt; was blocked from taking office.

After staging compromise talks with Mujibur Rahman, President [[Yahya Khan]] and military officials launched [[Operation Searchlight]],&lt;ref name=&quot;salik&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Salik |first=Siddiq |year=1978 |title=Witness to Surrender |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-577264-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; a sustained military assault on East Pakistan, and arrested Mujibur Rahman in the early hours of 26 March 1971. Yahya's methods were extremely bloody, and the violence of the war resulted in many civilian deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rummel&quot;&gt;Rummel, Rudolph J., [http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/SOD.CHAP8.HTM &quot;Statistics of Democide: Genocide and Mass Murder Since 1900&quot;], ISBN 3-8258-4010-7, Chapter 8, table 8.1.

Awami League leaders set up a government-in-exile in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], India. The exile government formally took oath at Meherpur, in the Kustia district of East Pakistan, on 17 April 1971, with [[Tajuddin Ahmad]] as the first Prime Minister and Syed Nazrul Islam as the Acting President. The [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] lasted for nine months. A resistance force known as the [[Mukti Bahini]] was formed from the [[Bangladesh Forces]] (consisting of Bengali regular forces) in alliance with civilian fighters such as the [[Kader Bahini]] and the [[Hemayet Bahini]]. Led by General [[M. A. G. Osmani]], the Bangladesh Forces were organized into [[list of Sectors in Bangladesh Liberation War|eleven sectors]] and, as part of Mukti Bahini, conducted a massive guerrilla war against the Pakistan Forces. The war witnessed the [[1971 Bangladesh genocide]], in which the [[Pakistan Army]] and its allied religious militias carried out a wide-scale elimination of Bengali civilians, intellectuals, youth, students, politicians, activists and religious minorities. By winter, [[Mitro Bahini|Bangladesh-India Allied Forces]] defeated the Pakistan Army, culminating in its [[Surrender of Pakistan|surrender]] and the Liberation of Dhaka on 16 December 1971.

After independence, the [[Constitution of Bangladesh]] established a unitary secular multiparty parliamentary democratic system. The Awami League won the first general elections in 1973 with a massive mandate, gaining an absolute parliamentary majority. A nationwide famine occurred during 1973 and 1974,&lt;ref name=&quot;sen&quot; /&gt; and in early 1975, Mujib initiated a one-party socialist rule with his newly formed [[BAKSAL]]. On 15 August 1975, Mujib and most of his family members were assassinated by mid-level military officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;mascarenhas&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Mascarenhas |first=A |year=1986 |title=Bangladesh: A Legacy of Blood |publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton, London |isbn=0-340-39420-X |oclc=13004864 16583315 242251870}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vice President Khandaker Mushtaq Ahmed was sworn in as President with most of Mujib's cabinet intact. Two Army uprisings on 3 November and 7 November 1975 led to a reorganised structure of power. A [[state of emergency]] was declared to restore order and calm. Mushtaq resigned, and the country was placed under temporary martial law, with three service chiefs serving as deputies to the new president, Justice Abu Sayem, who also became the Chief Martial Law Administrator. Lieutenant General [[Ziaur Rahman]] took over the presidency in 1977 when Justice Sayem resigned. President Zia reinstated multi-party politics, introduced free markets, and founded the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP). Zia's rule ended when he was assassinated by elements of the military in 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;mascarenhas&quot; /&gt;
Bangladesh's next major ruler was Lieutenant General [[Hossain Mohammad Ershad]], who gained power in a coup on 24 March 1982, and ruled until 6 December 1990, when he was forced to resign after a revolt of all major political parties and the public, along with pressure from Western donors (which was a major shift in international policy after the fall of the Soviet Union).

Since then, Bangladesh has reverted to a parliamentary democracy. Zia's widow, [[Khaleda Zia]], led the Bangladesh Nationalist Party to parliamentary victory at the general election in 1991 and became the first female Prime Minister in Bangladeshi history. However, the Awami League, headed by [[Sheikh Hasina]], one of Mujib's surviving daughters, won the next election in 1996. The Awami League lost again to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party in 2001. Widespread political unrest followed the resignation of the BNP in late October 2006, but the caretaker government worked to bring the parties to election within the required ninety days. At the last minute in early January, the Awami League withdrew from the election scheduled for later that month. On 11 January 2007, the military intervened to support both a state of emergency and a continuing but neutral caretaker government under a newly appointed [[Chief Advisor]], who was not a politician. The country had suffered for decades from extensive corruption,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4353334.stm |title=Bangladesh tops most corrupt list |publisher=BBC News |date=18 October 2005 |accessdate=13 April 2007 |first=Waliur |last=Rahman}}&lt;/ref&gt; disorder, and political violence. The caretaker government worked to root out corruption from all levels of government. It arrested on corruption charges more than 160 people, including politicians, civil servants, and businessmen, among whom were both major party leaders, some of their senior staff, and two sons of Khaleda Zia.

After working to clean up the system, the caretaker government held what was described by observers as a largely free and fair election on 29 December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/30/world/asia/30iht-bangla.5.19007747.html|title=Bangladesh election seen as fair, though loser disputes result|work=The New York Times|date=30 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Awami League's Sheikh Hasina won with a two-thirds landslide in the elections; she took the oath of Prime Minister on 6 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/01/06/us-bangladesh-hasina-idUSTRE5053GG20090106 |title= Hasina takes oath as new Bangladesh prime minister|agency=Reuters |date= 6 January 2009|accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bangladesh is dominated by the low-lying [[Ganges Delta]], but has highlands in the north and southeast. The Ganges delta is formed by the confluence of the Ganges (local name [[Padma River|Padma]] or ''Pôdda''), [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] ([[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]] or ''Jomuna''), and [[Meghna River|Meghna]] rivers and their respective tributaries. The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna, finally flowing into the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The [[Alluvium|alluvial soil]] deposited by the rivers when they overflow their banks has created some of the most fertile plains in the world. Bangladesh has 57 [[trans-boundary river]]s, making water issues politically complicated to resolve&amp;nbsp;– in most cases as the lower [[riparian zone|riparian]] state to India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Suvedī | first = Sūryaprasāda | title = International watercourses law for the 21st century | publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. | year = 2005 | pages = 154–166 | isbn = 0-7546-4527-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In southeastern Bangladesh, experiments have been done since the 1960s to 'build with nature'. Construction of cross dams has induced a natural accretion of silt, creating new land. With Dutch funding, the Bangladeshi government began promoting the development of this new land in the late 1970s. The effort has become a multiagency endeavor, building roads, culverts, embankments, cyclone shelters, toilets and ponds, as well as distributing land to settlers. By fall 2010, the program will have allotted some {{convert|27000|acre|ha|0|abbr=on}} to 21,000 families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pulitzercenter.org/articles/bangladesh-fights-survival-against-climate-change|title=&quot;Bangladesh fights for survival against climate change,&quot; by William Wheeler and Anna-Katarina Gravgaard, The Washington Times |publisher=Pulitzercenter.org |accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Straddling the [[Tropic of Cancer]], Bangladeshi climate is tropical with a mild winter from October to March, and a hot, humid summer from March to June.

In September 1998, Bangladesh saw [[1998 Bangladesh floods|the most severe flooding]] in modern world history. As the Brahmaputra, the Ganges and [[Meghna]] spilt over and swallowed 300,000 houses, {{convert|9700|km|mi|abbr=on}} of road and {{convert|2700|km|mi|abbr=on}} of embankment, 1,000&amp;nbsp;people were killed and 30&amp;nbsp;million more were made homeless, with 135,000 cattle killed, {{convert|50|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} of land destroyed and {{convert|11000|km|mi|abbr=on}} of roads damaged or destroyed. Two-thirds of the country was underwater.
There were several reasons for the severity of the flooding. Firstly, there were unusually high [[monsoon]] rains. Secondly, the [[Himalayas]] shed off an equally unusually high amount of melt water that year. Thirdly, trees that usually would have intercepted rain water had been cut down for firewood or to make space for animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;EWG&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Haggett|first=Peter |title= Encyclopedia of World Geography |url= http://books.google.com/?id=IROIY4ONOSEC&amp;pg=PA2634|accessdate=2 May 2008 |publisher= Marshall Cavendish |year= 2002|location= New York |isbn=0-7614-7308-4 |oclc= 46578454|pages=2, 634 |chapter=The Indian Subcontinent |origyear=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently it has 350 members (including 50 reserved seats for women) elected from single-member constituencies. The [[Prime Minister]], as the [[head of government]], forms the cabinet and runs the day-to-day affairs of state. The [[Prime Minister]] is formally appointed by the [[President of Bangladesh|President]] but must also be a [[member of parliament]] who commands the confidence of the majority.

The officers of the caretaker government must be non-partisan and are given three months to complete their task.

[[List of political parties in Bangladesh|Major parties]] in Bangladesh include the [[Awami League]], the [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]] (BNP), the [[Jatiya Party]] and the [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami|Jamaat-e-Islami]]. [[Sheikh Hasina]]'s Awami League aligns with more [[Left-wing politics|leftist]] parties, whereas [[Khaleda Zia]]'s BNP has politically been allied with [[Islamist]] parties like the Jamaat but practices secular politics. The former two have been bitter, dominant political rivals for over 15 years; each is related to one of the leaders of the independence movement. The Awami League-BNP rivalry has been punctuated by protests, violence and murder. Student politics are particularly strong in Bangladesh, a legacy from the liberation movement era, as almost all parties have highly active student wings, and student leaders have been elected to the Jatiyo Sangshad.

On 11 January 2007, following widespread political unrest, emergency law was declared and a caretaker government was appointed to administer the next general election. The 22 January 2007 election was postponed indefinitely as the Army-backed caretaker government of [[Fakhruddin Ahmed]] aimed to prepare a new voter list and crack down on corruption. They also assisted the interim government of Bangladesh in a drive against corruption, which resulted in Bangladesh's position in [[Transparency International]]'s [[Corruption Perceptions Index]] changed from the very bottom, where they had been for 3 years in a row, to 147th in just 1 year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2008/cpi2008/cpi_2008_table |title=cpi 2008 table /cpi2008/2008/in focus/news room |publisher=Transparency.org |accessdate=3 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100614084815/http://www.transparency.org/news_room/in_focus/2008/cpi2008/cpi_2008_table| archivedate= 14 June 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large alliance led by the Bangladesh Awami League won in a 29 December 2008 landslide victory, gaining 230 seats among 300 seats in the parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://123.49.39.5/result/report4.php?lang=en |title=Bangladesh Election Commission |publisher=123.49.39.5 |date=2 April 2009 |accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law &amp; Judiciary ===
Bangladeshi law is primarily in accordance with the English legal system, although since 1947 the legal scenario of Bangladesh has significantly drifted from the West owing to differences in socio-cultural values and religious guidelines. Laws are loosely based on English common law, but family laws such as marriage and inheritance are based on religious scriptures, and therefore differ between religious communities. The Constitution of Bangladesh was drafted in 1972 and has undergone 15 amendments.[54]

The highest judicial body is the Supreme Court, with justices appointed by the President. The judicial and law enforcement institutions are comparatively weak.[57] On 1 November 2007, Bangladesh successfully separated the Judiciary Branch from the Executive, but several black laws, including the Special Powers Act, still influence the rulers.[58] It is expected that this separation will make the judiciary stronger and more impartial.

Bangladesh pursues a moderate foreign policy which places heavy reliance on multinational diplomacy, especially at the United Nations. In 1974, Bangladesh joined both the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]] and has since been elected to serve two terms on the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]&amp;nbsp;– in 1978–1979 and 2000–2001. In the 1980s, Bangladesh pioneered the creation of the [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC), the first regional intergovernmental body in South Asia. It is also a founding member of the [[BIMSTEC|Bay of Bengal Initiative]] and the [[Developing 8 Countries]].

Bangladesh's most important and complex foreign [[Bangladesh-India relations|relationship]] is with neighbouring [[India]]. The [[Bangladesh-India relations|relationship]] is borne out of historical and cultural affinities, as well as India's alliance with Bangladeshi nationalists during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|liberation of Bangladesh]] in 1971. However, bilateral ties have gone through several hiccups in the last forty years. A major source of tension is water-sharing on 56 common rivers, as well as border security and India's barriers to trade and investments. Both countries have also at times accused each other of harbouring insurgent groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;MMAli&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first=M.M.|last=Ali |title= India's Major Gains and Losses in World Affairs |url= http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0397/9703025.htm|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20050410152043/http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/0397/9703025.htm|archivedate= 10 April 2005|journal=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs|date= March 1997|accessdate=29 April 2008|page=25|volume=0397}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognising the importance of good relations, regional security and South Asian economic integration, the two countries have sought to revive relations in recent years, and have formed strategic partnerships to develop regional connectivity, infrastructure, greater trade, mutual access to markets, energy, environmental protection and cultural projects.

Bangladesh enjoys [[Bangladesh-China relations|very warm ties]] with the [[People's Republic of China]], and particularly in the last decade there has been increased economic cooperation between them. Between 2006 and 2007, trade between the two nations rose by 28.5% and there have been agreements to grant various Bangladeshi commodities tariff-free access to the Chinese market. Cooperation between the [[Military of Bangladesh]] and the [[People's Liberation Army]] is also increasing, with joint military agreements signed and Bangladesh purchasing Chinese arms which range from small arms to large naval surface combat ships such as the Chinese [[Jianghu class frigate|Type 053H1]] Missile Frigate.

Bangladesh is a major [[South Asian foreign policy of the Barack Obama administration|South Asian ally]] of the [[United States]]. The two countries have long-standing partnerships in development, defense, energy, business, trade, education, health and the environment. As of 2011, American aid to Bangladesh totalled over US$6 billion. American companies are the largest foreign investors in country, and the US is also the largest market for Bangladeshi exports. In the 1991 [[Gulf War]], Bangladesh participated in the US-led multinational coalition to liberate Kuwait. It supports the US-led reconstruction of [[Afghanistan]], where Bangladeshi non-governmental agencies, such as [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]], are extensively involved in Afghan reconstruction efforts. The [[US Military]] and the [[Bangladesh Armed Forces]] have long-standing strategic relations and host frequent joint military exercises, particularly in [[counter-terrorism]] and maritime security. The US has also assisted Bangladesh with massive relief operations in the aftermath of several natural disasters, such as the [[1991 Bangladesh cyclone]] and [[Cyclone Sidr]]. In 2010, President [[Barack Obama]] announced a $1 billion aid package for Bangladesh, to be utilized from 2010 to 2015, in addressing challenges of food security, health and climate change. In 2011, Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] and Foreign Minister [[Dipu Moni]] launched annual strategic dialogues between the two countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;state.gov&quot; /&gt;

{{Further|Divisions of Bangladesh|Districts of Bangladesh|Upazilas of Bangladesh}}
{{stack|{{Bangladesh Divisions Image Map}}}}
Bangladesh is divided into seven administrative divisions,&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web |author=Central Intelligence Agency |title=Bangladesh |work=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency |location=Langley, Virginia |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bg.html|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dev-bd.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=151976&amp;cid=2 |title=Rangpur becomes a division |publisher=bdnews24.com |date=25 January 2010 |accessdate=6 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; each named after their respective divisional headquarters: [[Barisal Division|Barisal]], [[Chittagong Division|Chittagong]], [[Dhaka Division|Dhaka]], [[Khulna Division|Khulna]], [[Rajshahi Division|Rajshahi]], [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet]] and [[Rangpur Division|Rangpur]].

Divisions are subdivided into districts (''zila''). There are 64 districts in Bangladesh, each further subdivided into ''upazila'' (subdistricts) or ''thana''. The area within each police station, except for those in metropolitan areas, is divided into several ''[[Union Councils of Bangladesh|unions]]'', with each union consisting of multiple villages. In the metropolitan areas, police stations are divided into wards, which are further divided into ''mahallas''. There are no elected officials at the divisional or district levels, and the administration is composed only of government officials. Direct elections are held for each union (or ward), electing a chairperson and a number of members. In 1997, a parliamentary act was passed to reserve three seats (out of 12) in every union for female candidates.&lt;ref&gt;''Local Government Act'', No. 20, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dhaka]] is the capital and largest city of Bangladesh. The cities with a [[city corporation]], having mayoral elections, include [[Dhaka]] South, [[Dhaka]] North, [[Chittagong]], [[Khulna]], [[Sylhet]], [[Rajshahi]], [[Barisal]], [[Rangpur, Bangladesh|Rangpur]], [[Comilla]] and [[Gazipur, Dhaka Division|Gazipur]]. Other major cities, these and other municipalities electing a chairperson, include [[Mymensingh]], [[Gopalganj, Bangladesh|Gopalganj]], [[Jessore]], [[Bogra]], [[Dinajpur Sadar|Dinajpur]], [[Saidpur, Rangpur Division|Saidapur]], [[Narayanganj]] and [[Rangamati]]. Both the municipal heads are elected for a span of five years.

Bangladesh has seen a dramatic increase in [[foreign direct investment]]. In order to enhance economic growth, the government set up several export processing zones to attract foreign investment. These are managed by the [[Bangladesh Export Processing Zone Authority]].

[[Goldman Sachs]] recognized the Bangladeshi economy as one of the [[Next Eleven]]. [[Citigroup]] identified Bangladesh as a [[3G (countries)|3G country]] with significant potential to generate global growth.

The insufficient power supply constitutes an obstacle to growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bangladesh Power Development Board&quot;&gt;[http://www.bpdb.gov.bd/bpdb/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3&amp;Itemid=84 BPDB Power Availability Goals], June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; According to the World Bank, &quot;among Bangladesh’s most significant obstacles to growth are poor governance and weak public institutions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;worldbank-brief&quot;&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/SOUTHASIAEXT/BANGLADESHEXTN/0,,menuPK:295769~pagePK:141132~piPK:141107~theSitePK:295760,00.html Bangladesh&amp;nbsp;– Country Brief], [[World Bank]], July 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2010, [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] awarded Bangladesh a BB- for a long term in [[credit rating]] which is below India and well over Pakistan and Sri Lanka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=133282 |title=Bangladesh Gets first Credit Rating |work=The Daily Star |accessdate=7 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100407232636/http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=133282| archivedate= 7 April 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One significant contributor to the development of the economy has been the widespread propagation of [[microcredit]] by [[Muhammad Yunus (economist)|Muhammad Yunus]] (awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 2006) through the [[Grameen Bank]]. By the late 1990s, Grameen Bank had 2.3&amp;nbsp;million members, along with 2.5&amp;nbsp;million members of other similar organisations.&lt;ref name=&quot;schreiner&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schreiner |first=Mark |year=2003 |title=A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh |journal=Development Policy Review |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=357–382 |doi=10.1111/1467-7679.00215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bangladesh government is planning for construction of the largest deep sea port in South Asia at Sonadia Island. The 500 billion [[Bangladeshi taka|taka]] project will be completed in multiple phases and enable Bangladesh to service the whole region as a maritime transport and logistics hub.

[[Jute]] was once the economic engine of the country. Its share of the world export market peaked in the Second World War and the late 1940s at 80%&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wood | first = Geoffrey D. | title = Bangladesh: Whose ideas, whose interests? | publisher = Intermediate Technology Publications| year = 1994 | page = 111 | isbn = 1-85339-246-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even in the early 1970s accounted for 70% of its export earnings. However, [[polypropylene]] products began to substitute for jute products worldwide and the jute industry started to decline. Bangladesh grows very significant quantities of rice, tea, potato, mango, onion and [[Mustard plant|mustard]].

=== Industry ===
[[File:Garments Factory in Bangladesh.JPG|thumb|200px|Bangladesh is the world's second largest exporter of [[Bangladeshi RMG Sector|garments and textiles]] after China.]]
More than three-quarters of Bangladesh’s export earnings came from the [[garment industry]]&lt;ref name=&quot;garments&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Roland |first=B |title=Bangladesh Garments Aim to Compete |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4118969.stm | date=6 January 2005 | accessdate=1 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005. The industry began attracting foreign investors in the 1980s because of cheap labour and low conversion cost. As of 2014, Bangladesh is the world's second largest apparel exporter.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibtimes.com/despite-low-pay-poor-work-conditions-garment-factories-empowering-millions-bangladeshi-women-1563419&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been a significant growth to Bangladesh's ship building industry in the last few years. The required ships and vessels in the country are being produced by the local shipbuilders. Furthermore, they have already started taking orders and executing them perfectly for foreign companies from Germany, Denmark and other European countries who prefer the cheap market of Bangladesh over their local market. The [[Khulna Shipyard]] have successfully completed building a Khulna Class LPC(Large [[Patrol Craft]]) and a [[LCVP]](Landing Craft, Vehicle, Personnel) for the [[Bangladesh Navy]] and [[Bangladesh Army]] respectively, the cost being almost half of their import price. They are to build 5 more LPCs of the same class in the coming year.

Bangladesh's population growth rate was among the highest in the world in the 1960s and 1970s, when its population grew from 65 to 110&amp;nbsp;million. With the promotion of [[birth control]] in the 1980s, the growth rate began to slow. The fertility rate now stands at 2.55, lower than India (2.58) and Pakistan (3.07) The population is relatively young, with 34% aged 15 or younger and 5% 65 or older. [[Life expectancy]] at birth is estimated to be 70 years for both males and females in 2012.&lt;ref name=CIA /&gt; Despite the rapid economic growth, about 26% of the country still lives below the [[international poverty line]] which means living on less than $1.25 per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bangladesh: Human Development Indicators|url=http://hdrstats.undp.org/en/countries/profiles/BGD.html|accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a small but growing population of [[Rohingya people|Rohingya]] refugees from [[Burma]] around [[Cox's Bazaar]], which Bangladesh seeks to repatriate to Burma. The tribal peoples are concentrated in the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] in the southeast. There are 45 tribal groups located in this region, the largest being the [[Chakma people|Chakma]].

After Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan, [[Secularism]] was included in the original [[Constitution of Bangladesh]] in 1972 as one of the Four State Principles, the others being [[Democracy]], [[Nationalism]] and [[Socialism]]. In 2010, the High Court upheld the secular principles of the 1972 constitution but allowed to keep Islam as the state religion. Bangladesh follows secular government system in democratic state.

== Education ==
{{Main|Education in Bangladesh}}

[[File:Curzon hall front.jpg|thumb|Once known as the ''Oxford of the East'', the [[University of Dhaka]] is the country's oldest and highest ranking university]]

Bangladesh has a low [[literacy rate]], estimated at 61.3% for males and 52.2% for females in 2010.&lt;ref name=CIA /&gt; The educational system in Bangladesh is three-tiered and highly subsidized. The government of Bangladesh operates many schools in the primary, secondary, and higher secondary levels. It also subsidises parts of the funding for many private schools. In the tertiary education sector, the government also funds more than 15 state universities through the [[University Grants Commission of Bangladesh|University Grants Commission]].

The education system is divided into 5 levels: Primary (from grades 1 to 5), Junior Secondary (from grades 6 to 8), Secondary (from grades 9 to 10), Higher Secondary (from grades 11 to 12) and tertiary.&lt;ref name=CompEd&gt;{{cite book|author=T. Neville Postlethwaite|title=The Encyclopedia of Comparative Education and National Systems of Education|page=130|publisher=Pergamon Press|year=1988|isbn=0-08-030853-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five years of lower secondary education concludes with a [[Secondary School Certificate]] (SSC) Examination, but since 2009 it concludes with a Primary Education Closing (PEC) Examination. Also earlier Students who pass this examination proceed to four years Secondary or matriculation training, which culminate in a Secondary School Certificate (SSC) Examination, but since 2010 the Primary Education Closing (PEC) passed examinees proceed to three years Junior Secondary, which culminate in a [[Junior School Certificate]] (JSC) Examination. Then students who pass this examination proceed to two years Secondary or matriculation training, which culminate in a Secondary School Certificate (SSC) Examination. Students who pass this examination proceed to two years of Higher Secondary or intermediate training, which culminate in a [[Higher Secondary School Certificate]] (HSC) Examination.&lt;ref name=CompEd /&gt;

Education is mainly offered in [[Bengali language|Bengali]], but English is also commonly taught and used. A large number of Muslim families send their children to attend part-time courses or even to pursue full-time religious education, which is imparted in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in madrasahs.&lt;ref name=CompEd /&gt;

Bangladesh conforms fully to the [[Education For All]] (EFA) objectives, the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDG) and international declarations. &lt;!-- Who set the EFA and MDG declarations? --&gt; Article 17 of the [[Bangladesh Constitution]] provides that all children between the ages of six and ten years receive a basic education free of charge.

[[Universities in Bangladesh]] are mainly categorized into three different types: public university (government owned and subsidized), private university (private sector owned universities) and international university (operated and funded by international organizations). Bangladesh has some thirty-four public, sixty-four private and two international [[List of universities in Bangladesh|universities]]. [[Bangladesh National University|National University]] has the largest enrollment among them and [[University of Dhaka]] (established 1921) is the oldest university of the country. [[Islamic University of Technology]], commonly known as IUT is a subsidiary organ of the Organisation of the Islamic Cooperation ([[OIC]]), representing fifty seven member countries from Asia, Africa, Europe and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugc.gov.bd/university/?action=international|title= IUT is categorized as International University by UGC |publisher= UGC, Bangladesh  |accessdate=23 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology|BUET]] and [[Shahjalal University of Science and Technology|SUST]] are also two top universities of the country.

[[File:A community health worker conducting a survey in the Korail slum, Bangladesh (8630810827).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Community health worker]]s form the backbone of rural health services]]

In the rural areas, village doctors with little or no formal training constitute 62% of the healthcare providers practicing modern medicine and the formally trained providers are occupying a mere 4% of the total health workforce. A survey conducted by Future Health Systems revealed significant deficiencies in treatment practices of village doctors, with a wide prevalence of harmful and inappropriate drug prescriptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;FHS Research Brief 2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bhuiya|first=Abbas|title=Costs of utilizing healthcare services in Chakaria, a rural area in Bangladesh|journal=FHS Research Brief|date=June 2009|issue=2|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/fhs-bangladesh-research-brief-2-costs-of-utilizing-healthcar.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are market incentives for accessing health care through informal providers and it is important to understand these markets in order to facilitate collaboration across actors and institutions in order to provide incentives for better performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bloom|first=G|author2=et al.|title=Making Health Markets Work Better for Poor People: The Case of Informal Providers|journal=Health Policy and Planning|year=2011|volume=26|issue=Suppl 1|pages=i45&amp;nbsp;– i52|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/making-health-markets-work-better-for-poor-people-the-case-o.html|accessdate=26 May 2012|doi=10.1093/heapol/czr025|pmid=21729917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 study of 1000 households in rural Bangladesh found that direct costs (payment to formal and informal health care providers) and indirect costs (loss of earnings associated with workdays lost because of illness) associated with illness were important deterrents to accessing health care from qualified healthcare providers.&lt;ref name=&quot;FHS Research Brief 2&quot; /&gt; A community survey with 6183 individuals in rural Bangladesh found a clear gender difference in treatment-seeking behaviour, with women less likely to seek treatment compared to men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bhuiya|first=Abbas|title=Health Seeking Behaviour In Chakaria|journal=FHS Research Brief|date=September 2008|issue=1|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/fhs-bangladesh-research-brief-1-health-seeking-behaviour-in.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of skilled birth attendants, however, has risen between 2005 and 2007 by women in all wealth quintiles except the highest quintile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bhuiya|first=Abbas|author2=et al.|title=Three methods to monitor utilization of healthcare services by the poor|journal=Int J for Equity in Health|year=2009|volume=8|page=29|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/three-methods-to-monitor-utilization-of-healthcare-services.html|accessdate=26 May 2012|doi=10.1186/1475-9276-8-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A pilot community empowerment tool, called a health watch, was successfully developed and implemented in south-eastern Bangladesh in order to improve uptake and monitoring of public health services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aziz|first=Rumesa|title=A community health watch to establish accountability and improve performance of the health system|journal=FHS Research Brief|date=November 2009|issue=3|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/fhs-bangladesh-research-brief-3-a-community-health-watch-to.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poor health conditions in Bangladesh is attributed by the lack of healthcare and services provision by the government. The total expenditure on healthcare as a percentage of their GDP was only 3.35% in 2009, according to a World Bank report published in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;apps.who.int&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO {{!}} Global Health Observatory Data Repository|url=http://apps.who.int/ghodata/?vid=4200&amp;theme=country#|accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of hospital beds per 10,000 population is 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hospital Beds (Per 10,000 Population) – Globalhealthfacts.org|url=http://www.globalhealthfacts.org/data/topic/map.aspx?ind=78|accessdate=14 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The General government expenditure on healthcare as a percentage of total government expenditure was only 7.9% as of 2009 and the citizens pay most of their health care bills as the out-of-pocket expenditure as a percentage of private expenditure on health is 96.5%.&lt;ref name=&quot;apps.who.int&quot; /&gt;

[[Bengali language|Bengali]] has a rich literary heritage, which Bangladesh shares with the Indian state of West [[Bengal]]. The earliest literary text in Bengali is the 8th century [[Charyapada]]. Medieval Bengali literature was often either religious (for example, [[Chandidas]]), or adapted from other languages (for example, [[Alaol]]). Bengali literature reached its full expression in the 19th century, with its greatest icons being poets, the national poet [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay|Sarat Chandra]], [[Jasim Uddin]], [[Jibanananda Das]], [[Shamsur Rahman]], [[Al Mahmud]], [[Sukanta Bhattacharya]], [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]], [[Michael Madhusudan Dutt]] and present day [[Humayun Ahmed]], [[Muhammed Zafar Iqbal]]. Bangladesh also has a long tradition in folk literature, for example ''[[Maimansingha Gitika]]'', ''[[Thakurmar Jhuli]]'' and stories related to ''[[Gopal Bhar]]'', ''Birbal'' and ''Molla Nasiruddin''.

=== Cinema ===
{{Main|Cinema of Bangladesh}}
The Bangladeshi film industry has been based in Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, since 1956. As of 2004, it produced approximately 100 movies a year, with an average movie budget of about 20,000,000 Bangladeshi taka. The film industry is known as ''Dhallywood'', a portmanteau of the words Dhaka and Hollywood. Bangladesh produces about 80 films a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Logan | first = Stephen | title = Asian communication handbook 2008 | publisher = AMIC | year = 2008  | page = 115 | isbn = 981-4136-10-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ektara.JPG|thumb|upright|The one string [[ektara]] is often played by [[Baul]] folk minstrels]]
The musical tradition of Bangladesh is lyrics-based (''Baniprodhan''), with minimal instrumental accompaniment. Numerous musical traditions exist including [[Gombhira]], [[Bhatiali]] and [[Bhawaiya]], varying from one region to the next. Folk music is accompanied by the [[ektara]], an instrument with only one string. Other instruments include the [[dotara]], [[dhol]], [[flute]], and [[tabla]]. Bangladesh also has an active heritage in [[Hindustani classical music|North Indian classical music]]. Similarly, Bangladeshi dance forms draw from folk traditions, especially those of the tribal groups, as well as the broader Indian dance tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = London | first = Ellen | title = Bangladesh | publisher = Gareth Stevens Pub. | year = 2004 | page = 29 | isbn = 0-8368-3107-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Baul]] tradition was included in the list of &quot;[[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]&quot; by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref name=unesco&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=30973&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity].

Several private FM radio stations ([[Radio Foorti]], [[ABC Radio (Bangladesh)|ABC Radio]], [[Radio Today]], [[Radio Amar]] etc.) are popular among urban youths. International Bengali-language broadcasts include [[BBC Bangla]] and [[Voice of America]]. The dominant television channel is the state-owned [[Bangladesh Television]], but in the last few years, privately owned channels have developed considerably. Some popular privately owned TV channels are [[ATN Bangla]], [[Channel i]], [[NTV (Bangladesh)|NTV]], [[Ekushey Television]], [[Desh TV]], [[RTV (Bangladesh)|RTV]], [[Banglavision]], [[Islamic TV]], [[Boishakhi TV]], [[Mohona TV]], [[ATN News]], [[Somoy TV]], [[Independent Television (Bangladesh)|Independent TV]], [[Channel 9 Bangladesh]] etc.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Bangladeshi cuisine}}
The culinary tradition of Bangladesh has close relations to surrounding Bengali and North-East Indian cuisine as well as having its own unique traits. Rice and fish are traditional favourites. With an emphasis on fish, vegetables and lentils served with rice as a staple diet. [[Biryani]] is a favourite dish of Bangladesh and this includes egg biryani, mutton biryani and beef biryani. Bengaladeshi cuisine is known for its subtle (yet sometimes fiery) flavours, and its huge spread of confectioneries and desserts. Bangladeshis make distinctive [[confectionary|sweetmeats]] from milk products, some common ones being ''[[Rasgulla|Rôshogolla]]'', ''Rasmalai'', ''Rôshomalai'', ''chômchôm'' and ''kalojam''.
It also has the only traditionally developed multi-course tradition from the [[Indian subcontinent]] that is analogous in structure to the modern ''[[service à la russe]]'' style of [[French cuisine]], with food served course-wise rather than all at once.

=== Textiles and craftsmanship ===
[[File:Blue jamdani.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Jamdani]] [[muslin]] is [[Intangible cultural heritage|UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage]]]]
{{Main|Bangladesh textile industry|Textile arts of Bangladesh}}
The [[Sari]] ({{lang|bn|শাড়ি}} ''shaŗi'') is by far the most widely worn dress by Bangladeshi women. A guild of weavers in Dhaka is renowned for producing saris from exquisite [[Jamdani]] [[muslin]]. The [[salwar kameez]] ''(shaloar kamiz)'' is also quite popular, especially among the younger females, and in urban areas some women wear western attire. Among men, western attire is more widely adopted. Men also wear the ''[[kurta]]-paejama'' combination, often on special occasions, and the [[lungi]], a kind of long skirt for men.

=== Festivals ===
{{Main|Public holidays in Bangladesh}}
The Muslim holidays of [[Eid al-Fitr]] and [[Eid al-Adha]], the [[Pohela Boishakh|Bengali New Year]], [[Independence Day (Bangladesh)|Independence day]], [[Victory Day (Bangladesh)|Victory Day]], the Hindu festivals of [[Durga Puja]] and [[Krishna Janmashtami]],&lt;!--Please note that remembrance is a major part of Language Movement Day and therefore can't be classed as a celebration--&gt; the Buddhist festival of [[Vesak|Buddha Purnima]], which marks the birth of [[Gautama Buddha]], and [[Christmas]], called ''Borodin'' (&quot; the Great day&quot;), are [[Public holidays in Bangladesh|national holidays]] in Bangladesh and see the most widespread celebrations in the country.

''[[Pohela Boishakh]]'', the Bengali new year, is the major festival of [[Culture of Bengal|Bengali culture]] and sees widespread festivities. Of the major holidays celebrated in Bangladesh, only ''Pohela Boishakh'' comes without any preexisting expectations (specific religious identity, culture of gift-giving, etc.). Unlike holidays like Eid al-Fitr, where dressing up in lavish clothes has become a norm, or Christmas where exchanging gifts has become an integral part of the holiday, Pohela Boishakh is really about celebrating the simpler, rural roots of the Bengal. As a result, more people can participate in the festivities together without the burden of having to reveal one's class, religion, or financial capacity. Other cultural festivals include [[Nabanna|Nabonno]], and ''Poush porbon'' (festival of [[Poush]]), both Bengali harvest festivals.

Alongside these are national days like the remembrance of 21 February 1952 [[Language Movement Day]] ([[International Mother Language Day]]), Independence Day and [[Victory day of Bangladesh|Victory Day]]. On Language Movement Day, people congregate at the [[Shaheed Minar, Dhaka|Shaheed Minar]] in Dhaka to remember the national heroes of the [[Bengali Language Movement]], and at the [[Jatiyo Smriti Soudho]] on Independence Day and Victory Day to remember the national heroes of the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. These occasions are observed with public ceremonies, parades, rallies by citizens, political speeches, fairs, concerts, and various other public and private events celebrating the history and traditions of Bangladesh. TV and radio stations broadcast special programs and patriotic songs. And many schools and colleges organise fairs, festivals, and concerts in which citizens from all levels of society can participate.
