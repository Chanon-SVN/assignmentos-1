===Nationally===
The [[Bastille Day Military Parade]] opens with [[cadet]]s from the [[École polytechnique]], [[École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr]], [[École Navale]], and so forth, then other [[infantry]] troops, then motorized troops; [[aircraft]] of the [[Patrouille de France]] aerobatics team fly above. In recent times, it has become custom to invite units from France's allies to the parade. In 2004 during the centenary of the [[Entente Cordiale]], [[British Armed Forces|British troops]] (the band of the [[Royal Marines]], the [[Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment]], [[Grenadier Guards]] and [[King's Troop, Royal Horse Artillery]]) led the Bastille Day parade in Paris for the first time, with the [[Red Arrows]] flying overhead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entente-cordiale.org/en/6a_c.php?id=1] {{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the German 26th Airborne Brigade led the march followed by British Royal Marines. In 2013, [[Military of Mali|Malian soldiers]] opened the parade, following the Franco-Malian military [[Operation Serval]]. Members of the [[United Nations]]' [[United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali|MINUSMA]] forces also took part in the parade, including soldiers from twelve other African countries, notably [[Chad]]. [[United Nations Secretary General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] attended the parade alongside French President [[François Hollande]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Le Monde.fr 2013&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=14-Juillet : les troupes africaines à l'honneur sur les Champs-Elysées|website=Le Monde.fr|date=14 July 2013|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/international/article/2013/07/14/14-juillet-les-troupes-africaines-a-l-honneur-sur-les-champs-elysees_3447369_3210.html|language=fr|accessdate=18 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Prise de la Bastille.jpg|thumb|right|none|225px|''Storming of the Bastille'', by Jean-Pierre-Louis-Laurent Houel]]

===Storming of the Bastille===
{{main|Storming of the Bastille}}

On 19 May 1789, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] convened the [[Estates-General of 1789|Estates-General]] to hear their grievances. The deputies of the Third Estate, representing the common people (the two others were the [[Catholic Church]] and [[nobility]]), decided to break away and form a [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]]. On 20 June the deputies of the Third Estate took the [[Tennis Court Oath]], swearing not to separate until a constitution had been established. They were gradually joined by delegates of the other estates; [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] started to recognize their validity on 27 June. The assembly renamed itself the National Constituent Assembly on 9 July, and began to function as a legislature and to draft a constitution.{{citation needed|date = July 2014}}

In the wake of the 11 July dismissal of [[Jacques Necker]] (the finance minister, who was sympathetic to the Third Estate), the people of [[Paris]], fearful that they and their representatives would be attacked by the royal army, and seeking to gain ammunition and gunpowder for the general populace, stormed the [[Bastille]], a fortress-prison in Paris which had often held people jailed on the basis of ''[[lettre de cachet|lettres de cachet]]'', arbitrary royal indictments that could not be appealed. Besides holding a large cache of ammunition and gunpowder, the Bastille had been known for holding political prisoners whose writings had displeased the royal government, and was thus a symbol of the [[political absolutism|absolutism]] of the monarchy. As it happened, at the time of the attack in July 1789 there were only seven inmates, none of great political significance.{{citation needed|date = July 2014}}

When the crowd—eventually reinforced by mutinous ''[[Gardes Françaises|gardes françaises]]''—proved a fair match for the fort's defenders, [[Bernard-René de Launay|Governor de Launay]], the commander of the Bastille, capitulated and opened the gates to avoid a mutual massacre. However, possibly because of a misunderstanding, fighting resumed. Ninety-eight attackers and just one defender died in the actual fighting, but in the aftermath, de Launay and seven other defenders were killed, as was the 'prévôt des marchands' (roughly, mayor) [[Jacques de Flesselles]].{{citation needed|date = July 2014}}

Shortly after the storming of the Bastille, on 4 August, [[feudalism]] was abolished.  On 26 August, the ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]]'' was proclaimed.{{citation needed|date = July 2014}}

===''Fête de la Fédération''===
{{main|Fête de la Fédération}}

The Fête de la Fédération on the 14 July 1790 was a celebration  the unity of the [[France|French Nation]] during the [[French Revolution]].The aim of this Celebration was to symbolize Peace one year after the [[Storming of the Bastille]].  The event took place on the Champ de Mars, which was at the time far outside Paris. The place had been transformed on a voluntary basis by the population of Paris itself, in what was recalled as the Journée des brouettes (&quot;Wheelbarrow Day&quot;).

A mass was celebrated by [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord|Talleyrand]], [[bishop of Autun]]. The popular [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|General Lafayette]], as captain of the National Guard of Paris and confidant of the king, took his oath to the constitution, followed by King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]. After the end of the official celebration, the day ended in a huge four-day popular feast and people celebrated with fireworks, as well as fine wine and running naked through the streets in order to display their great freedom.

===Origin of the present celebration===
On 30 June 1878, a feast had been arranged in Paris by official decision to honour the French Republic (the event was commemorated in a painting by [[Claude Monet]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Adamson|first=Natalie|title=Painting, politics and the struggle for the École de Paris, 1944-1964|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EgNGAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=13 July 2011|date=2009-08-15|publisher=Ashgate|isbn=978-0-7546-5928-0|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 July 1879, another feast took place, with a semi-official aspect; the events of the day included a reception in the Chamber of Deputies, organised and presided over by [[Léon Gambetta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nord|first=Philip G.|title=Impressionists and politics: art and democracy in the nineteenth century|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=cNSVHrVlGMQC&amp;pg=PA37|accessdate=13 July 2011|year=2000|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-20695-2|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; a military review in Longchamp, and a Republican Feast in the [[Bois de Boulogne|Pré Catelan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nord|first=Philip G.|title=The republican moment: struggles for democracy in nineteenth-century France|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RDo7CFULR74C&amp;pg=PA205|accessdate=13 July 2011|year=1995|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-76271-8|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; All through France, ''[[Le Figaro]]'' wrote, &quot;people feasted much to honour the storming of the Bastille&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paris Au Jour Le Jour|url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k277157p/f4.image|accessdate=15 January 2013|newspaper=Le Figaro|date=16 July 1879|page=4|quote=On a beaucoup banqueté avant-hier, en mémoire de la prise de la Bastille, et comme tout banquet suppose un ou plusieurs discours, on a aussi beaucoup parlé.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 May 1880, [[Benjamin Raspail]] proposed a law to have &quot;the Republic choose the 14 July as a yearly national holiday&quot;. The Assembly voted in favour of the proposal on 21 May and 8 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lüsebrink|first1=Hans-Jürgen|last2=Reichardt|first2=Rolf|title=The Bastille: a history of a symbol of despotism and freedom|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jN9WU-2X8t4C&amp;pg=PA229|accessdate=13 July 2011|year=1997|publisher=[[Duke University Press]]|isbn=978-0-8223-1894-1|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate approved on it 27 and 29 June, favouring 14 July against 4 August (honouring the [[The Abolition of Feudalism|end of the feudal system]] on 4 August 1789). The law was made official on 6 July 1880, and the Ministry of the Interior recommended to Prefects that the day should be &quot;celebrated with all the brilliance that the local resources allow&quot;.{{Cite quote|date=July 2011}} Indeed, the celebrations of the new holiday in 1880 were particularly magnificent.

In the debate leading up to the adoption of the holiday, [[Henri Martin (historian)|Henri Martin]], chairman of the French Senate, addressed that chamber on 29 June 1880:
{{Quote|text=Do not forget that behind this 14&amp;nbsp;July, where victory of the new era over the ''[[ancien régime]]'' was bought by fighting, do not forget that after the day of 14&amp;nbsp;July 1789, there was the day of 14&amp;nbsp;July 1790.... This [latter] day cannot be blamed for having shed a drop of blood, for having divided the country. It was the consecration of the unity of France.... If some of you might have scruples against the first 14&amp;nbsp;July, they certainly hold none against the second. Whatever difference which might part us, something hovers over them, it is the great images of national unity, which we all desire, for which we would all stand, willing to die if necessary.|sign=[[Henri Martin (historian)|Henri Martin]], Chairman of the Sénat, 1880 &lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.greetingcarduniverse.com/2011/07/le-quatorze-juillet/ Le Quatorze Juillet] at the [http://blog.greetingcarduniverse.com/ Greeting Card Universe Blog]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Bastille Day Military Parade===
{{main|Bastille Day Military Parade}}
The [[Bastille Day Military Parade]] is the French [[military parade]] that has been held on the morning of 14 July each year in [[Paris]] since 1880. While previously held elsewhere within or near the capital city, since 1918 it has been held on the [[Champs-Élysées]], with the participation of the Allies as represented in the Versailles Peace Conference, and with the exception of the period of German occupation from 1940 to 1944 (when the ceremony took place in London under the command of [[General de Gaulle]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.garnison-paris.terre.defense.gouv.fr/14juillet2008/les-coulisses/historique-du-defile.htm Défilé du 14 juillet, des origines à nos jours] (14 July Parade, from its origins to the present)&lt;/ref&gt; The parade passes down the Champs-Élysées from the [[Arc de Triomphe]] to the [[Place de la Concorde]], where the [[President of the French Republic]], his government and foreign ambassadors to France stand. This is a popular event in [[France]], broadcast on French TV, and is the oldest and largest regular military parade in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;paris1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;paris-attractions1&quot;/&gt; In some years, invited detachments of foreign troops take part in the parade and foreign statesmen attend as guests.

Smaller military parades are held in French garrison towns, including [[Toulon]] and [[Belfort]], with local troops.
