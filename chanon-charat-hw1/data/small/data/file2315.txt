'''Bigfoot''' (also known as '''Sasquatch''') is the name given to a [[cryptid]] [[ape]]- or [[Hominidae|hominid]]-like creature that reputedly inhabits forests, mainly in the [[Pacific Northwest]] region of [[North America]]. Bigfoot is usually described as a large, hairy, [[Bipedalism|bipedal]] [[humanoid]]. The term ''sasquatch'' is an anglicized derivative of the [[Halkomelem]] word ''sásq'ets''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bright&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bright|first=William|authorlink=William Bright|title=Native American Placenames of the United States|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5XfxzCm1qa4C&amp;pg=PA422|accessdate=November 10, 2014|year=2004|publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]]|isbn=978-0-8061-3598-4|page=422}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Galloway|first=Brent D.|title=Dictionary of Upriver Halkomelem, Volume I|year=2009|publisher=University of California Press|page=558}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com|Sasquatch|accessdate=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scientists discount the existence of Bigfoot and consider it to be a combination of [[folklore]], misidentification, and [[hoax]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dae04|Daegling 2004]], pp. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than a living animal, because of the lack of physical evidence and the large numbers of creatures that would be necessary to maintain a breeding population.&lt;ref name=&quot;skepdic&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;breedingpop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://home.clara.net/rfthomas/news/bfhunting.html |title= Bigfoot hunting |author= Earls, Stephanie |accessdate= January 2, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100129061319/http://home.clara.net/rfthomas/news/bfhunting.html| archivedate= January 29, 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists [[Grover Krantz]] and [[Jeffrey Meldrum]] have focused research on the creature for the greater parts of their careers.

==Description==

==History==

===Before 1958===
Wildmen stories are found among the [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast|indigenous population]] of the Pacific Northwest. The legends existed before a single name for the creature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dae04_p28&quot;&gt;[[#Dae04|Daegling 2004]], p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; They differed in their details both regionally and between families in the same community. Similar stories of wildmen are found on every continent except Antarctica.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dae04_p28&quot; /&gt; Ecologist [[Robert Michael Pyle]] argues that most cultures have human-like giants in their folk history: &quot;We have this need for some larger-than-life creature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodavage&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodavage |first=Maria |title=Hunt for Bigfoot Attracts True Believers |publisher=''USA TODAY''/bz050 |date=May 24, 1996 |url=http://web.ncf.ca/bz050/HomePage.usatbf.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the [[Lummi]] tell tales about ''Ts'emekwes'', the local version of Bigfoot. The stories are similar to each other in the general descriptions of ''Ts'emekwes'', but details about the creature's diet and activities differed between family stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rasmus|first1=Stacy M.|title=Repatriating Words: Local Knowledge in a Global Context|journal=[[American Indian Quarterly]]|date=2002|volume=26|issue=2|pages=286–307|doi=10.1353/aiq.2003.0018|jstor=4128463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some regional versions contained more nefarious creatures. The ''stiyaha'' or ''kwi-kwiyai'' were a nocturnal race that children were told not to say the names of lest the monsters hear and come to carry off a person—sometimes to be killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rigsby&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Rigsby |first=Bruce |title=Some Pacific Northwest Native Language Names for the Sasquatch Phenomenon |publisher=Bigfoot: Fact or Fantasy? |url=http://home.clara.net/rfthomas/papers/rigsby.html |accessdate=August 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, Paul Kane reported stories by the native people about ''skoocooms'': a race of cannibalistic wildmen living on the peak of [[Mount St. Helens]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SI_Nickell&quot; /&gt; The ''[[Skookum#monsters|skoocooms]]'' appear to have been regarded as supernatural, rather than natural.&lt;ref name=&quot;SI_Nickell&quot; /&gt;&lt;!--strikes me as POV in nature; natives do NOT see it that way; rather the natural and supernatural are one; this is an example of systemic bias; there are few indigenous sources cited in this article, only bigfoot theorists and anti-theorists--&gt;

Less menacing versions such as the one recorded by Reverend Elkanah Walker exist. In 1840, Walker, a Protestant missionary, recorded stories of giants among the Native Americans living in [[Spokane, Washington]]. The Indians claimed that these giants lived on and around the peaks of nearby mountains and stole salmon from the fishermen's nets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfootencounters.com/classics/walker.htm |title=The Diary of Elkanah Walker |publisher=Bigfoot Encounters |accessdate=August 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local legends were compiled by Indian Agent J.&amp;nbsp;W. Burns in a series of Canadian newspaper articles in the 1920s recounting stories told to him by the [[Sts'Ailes people]] of [[Chehalis, British Columbia|Chehalis]] and others.  The Sts'Ailes maintain, as do other indigenous peoples of the region, that the Sasquatch are very real, not legendary, and take great umbrage when it is suggested that they are.  According to Sts'Ailes eyewitness accounts, the Sasquatch prefer to avoid white men, and speak the &quot;Douglas language&quot;, i.e. ''Ucwalmicwts'', the language of the people at [[Port Douglas, British Columbia]] at the head of [[Harrison Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bigfootencounters.com/legends/jwburns.htm ''The Hairy Giants of British Columbia'', told by J.W. Burns, Indian Agent and teacher, Chehalis Indian Reserve, set down by C.V.

A story told to [[Charles Hill-Tout]] by Chief Mischelle of the [[Nlaka'pamux]] at [[Lytton, British Columbia]] in 1898 gives another Salishan variant of the name, meaning &quot;the benign-faced-one&quot;.

Each language had its own name for the local version. Many names meant something along the lines of &quot;wild man&quot; or &quot;hairy man&quot; although other names described common actions it was said to perform, ''e.g.'', eating clams.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mil07&quot; /&gt;

===After 1958===
In 1951, [[Eric Shipton]] photographed what he described as a [[Yeti]] footprint,&lt;ref name=&quot;missingLinks&quot; /&gt; which generated considerable attention and led to the story of the Yeti entering popular consciousness. The notoriety of ape-men grew over the decade, culminating in 1958 when large footprints were found in [[Del Norte County, California]] by bulldozer operator Gerald Crew. Sets of large tracks appeared multiple times around a road-construction site in Bluff Creek. After not being taken seriously about what he was seeing, Crew brought in his friend, Bob Titmus, to cast the prints in plaster. The story was published in the ''[[Times-Standard|Humboldt Times]]'' along with a photo of Crew holding one of the casts.&lt;ref name=&quot;SI_Nickell&quot; /&gt;

Locals had been calling the unseen track-maker &quot;Big Foot&quot; since the late summer, which ''Humboldt Times'' columnist Andrew Genzoli shortened to &quot;Bigfoot&quot; in his article.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Buhs|Blu Buhs 2009]], pp. 69, 75&lt;/ref&gt; Bigfoot gained international attention when the story was picked up by the [[Associated Press]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SI_Nickell&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Big Footprints: A Scientific Inquiry into the Reality of Sasquatch |last=Krantz |first=Grover |authorlink=Grover Krantz |year=1992 |publisher=Johnson Books |isbn=1-55566-099-1 |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of [[Raymond L. Wallace|Ray Wallace]] – a local logger – his family attributed the creation of the footprints to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;skepdic&quot; /&gt; The wife of L.&amp;nbsp;W. &quot;Scoop&quot; Beal, the editor of the ''Humboldt Standard'', which later combined with the ''Humboldt Times'', in which Genzoli's story had appeared,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Buhs|Blu Buhs 2009]], p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; has stated that her husband was in on the hoax with Wallace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last=Driscoll | first=John  | title=Birth of Bigfoot | newspaper=The Times-Standard | publication-place=Eureka, CA | date=October 30, 2008 | url=http://www.times-standard.com/ci_10853838 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1958 was a watershed year not just for the Bigfoot story itself but also for the culture that surrounds it. The first Bigfoot hunters appeared following the discovery of footprints at Bluff Creek, California. Within a year, Tom Slick, who had funded searches for Yeti in the Himalayas earlier in the decade, organized searches for Bigfoot in the area around Bluff Creek.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dae04|Daegling 2004]], p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

As Bigfoot has become better known and a [[Bigfoot in popular culture|phenomenon in popular culture]], sightings have spread throughout North America. In addition to the Pacific Northwest, the [[Great Lakes region]] and the [[Southeastern United States]] have had many reports of Bigfoot sightings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfro.net/GDB/ |title=Geographical Database of Bigfoot/Sasquatch Sightings &amp; Reports |publisher=[[BFRO]] |accessdate=April 10, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090228213753/http://www.bfro.net/GDB/| archivedate= February 28, 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate over the legitimacy of Bigfoot sightings reached a peak in the 1970s, and Bigfoot has been regarded as the first widely popularized example of pseudoscience in American culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLeod 2009 4&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Anatomy of a Beast: Obsession and Myth on the Trail of Bigfoot|last=McLeod|first=Michael|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=978-0-520-25571-5|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_6FmjJYd13wC&amp;pg=PA4|page=4|year=2009|location=Berkley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The supposed incident was widely reported at the time.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Gorilla Seeahtik Indians and prospectors,&quot; ''Engineering and Mining Journal-Press'', August 16, 1924, p.242.&lt;/ref&gt; Beck wrote a book about the alleged event in 1967, in which he argued that the creatures were mystical beings from another dimension, claiming that he had experienced psychic premonitions and visions his entire life of which the apemen were only one component.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Fred; told to Ronald A. Beck. (1967) [http://www.bigfootencounters.com/classics/beck.htm ''I Fought The Apemen of Mount St. Helens, WA.'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Speleology|Speleologist]] William Halliday argued in 1983 that the story arose from an incident in which hikers from a nearby camp had thrown rocks into the canyon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ape Cave and the Mount St. Helens Apes |first=William R. |last=Halliday |year=1983 |isbn=1-886168-00-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also local rumors that pranksters harassed the men and planted faked footprints.&lt;ref name=&quot;SI_Nickell&quot; /&gt;

*'''1958''': Bulldozer operator Jerry Crew took to a newspaper office a cast of one of the enormous footprints he and other workers had seen at an isolated work site at Bluff Creek, California. The crew was overseen by Wilbur L. Wallace, brother of [[Raymond L. Wallace]].

*'''1967''': Roger Patterson and Robert Gimlin reported that on October 20 they had captured a purported Sasquatch on film at Bluff Creek, California. This came to be known as the [[Patterson–Gimlin film]]. Many years later, Bob Heironimus, an acquaintance of Patterson's, said that he had worn an ape costume for the making of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;SI_Nickell&quot; /&gt; However, Patterson and Gimlin claimed that they sought various experts to examine the film. Patterson claimed to have screened the film for unnamed technicians &quot;in the special effects department at [[Universal Studios]] in [[Hollywood]] ...

==Proposed explanations for sightings==
Various types of creatures have been suggested to explain both the sightings and what type of creature Bigfoot would be if it existed. The scientific community typically attributes sightings to either hoaxes or misidentification of known animals and their tracks. While [[Cryptozoology|cryptozoologists]] generally explain Bigfoot as an unknown ape, some believers in Bigfoot attribute the phenomenon to [[Unidentified flying object|UFOs]] or other [[paranormal]] causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/scenes_from_a_bigfoot_conference |last=Boston |first=Rob |title=Scenes from a Bigfoot Conference |publisher=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=December 2003 |accessdate=August 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misidentification===

In 2007, the [[Pennsylvania Game Commission]] said that photos the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization claimed showed a juvenile Bigfoot were probably of a bear with [[mange]].&lt;ref name = &quot;ap_bigfoot&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-490638/Is-Bigfoot---bear-bad-skin.html|title=Is this Bigfoot ... or is it a bear with bad skin?|publisher=[[Mail Online]]|date=October 30, 2007 |accessdate=August 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21518056/ |title=Hunter's pics revive lively Bigfoot debate |publisher=MSNBC |date=October 29, 2007 |accessdate=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jeffrey Meldrum]], on the other hand, said the limb proportions of the suspected juvenile in question were not bear-like, and stated that he felt they were &quot;more like a chimpanzee.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earthfiles333.com/earthfiles/Episode27mp3.html |title=Young Sasquatch?

===Hoaxes===
Both scientists and Bigfoot believers agree that many of the sightings are hoaxes or misidentified animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;SI_Radford&quot; /&gt;

Bigfoot sightings or footprints are often demonstrably hoaxes. Author Jerome Clark argues that the [[Jacko hoax|Jacko Affair]], involving an 1884 newspaper report of an apelike creature captured in British Columbia, was a hoax. Citing research by John Green, who found that several contemporary British Columbia newspapers regarded the alleged capture as very dubious, Clark notes that the ''Mainland Guardian'' of [[New Westminster]], [[British Columbia]], wrote, &quot;Absurdity is written on the face of it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=195 |last=Clark |first=Jerome |title=Unexplained! 347 Strange Sightings, Incredible Occurrences and Puzzling Physical Phenomena |publisher=Visible Ink |year=1993 |isbn=0-8103-9436-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 14, 2005, [[Tom Biscardi]], a long-time Bigfoot enthusiast and CEO of Searching for Bigfoot Inc., appeared on the ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'' paranormal radio show and announced that he was &quot;98% sure that his group will be able to capture a Bigfoot which they have been tracking in the [[Happy Camp, California]] area.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Biscardi_C2C&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oregonbigfoot.com/georgia_bigfoot_dead_body_in_freezer_dyer_whitton_biscardi.php |title= Georgia Bigfoot body in freezer |accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, Biscardi announced on the same radio show that he had access to a captured Bigfoot and was arranging a [[pay-per-view]] event for people to see it. Biscardi appeared on ''Coast to Coast AM'' again a few days later to announce that there was no captive Bigfoot. Biscardi blamed an unnamed woman for misleading him and the show's audience for being gullible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biscardi_C2C&quot; /&gt;

On July 9, 2008, [[Rick Dyer]] and Matthew Whitton posted a video to [[YouTube]] claiming that they had discovered the body of a dead Sasquatch in a forest in northern [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Tom Biscardi was contacted to investigate.

===''Gigantopithecus''===
[[File:Gigantopithecus blacki mandible 010112.jpg|250px|thumb|Fossil jaw of ''Gigantopithecus blacki'', an extinct primate]]
Bigfoot proponents [[Grover Krantz]] and [[Geoffrey H. Bourne]] believed that Bigfoot could be a [[relict|relict population]] of ''[[Gigantopithecus]]''. Bourne contends that as all ''Gigantopithecus'' fossils were found in Asia, and as many species of animals migrated across the [[Beringia|Bering land bridge]], it is not unreasonable to assume that ''Gigantopithecus'' might have as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Gentle Giants: The Gorilla Story |last=Bourne |first=Geoffrey H. |author2=Cohen, Maury |year=1975 |publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons |isbn=0-399-11528-5 |page=296 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Gigantopithecus'' hypothesis is generally considered entirely speculative. ''Gigantopithecus'' fossils are not found in the Americas.  As the only recovered fossils are of [[mandible]]s and teeth, there is some uncertainty about ''Gigantopithecus's'' locomotion. Krantz has argued, based on his extrapolation of the shape of its mandible, that ''[[Gigantopithecus|Gigantopithecus blacki]]'' could have been bipedal.  However, the relevant part of mandible is not present in any fossils.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dae04|Daegling 2004]], p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; The mainstream view is that ''Gigantopithecus'' was [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]], and it has been argued that ''Gigantopithecus's'' enormous mass would have made it difficult for it to adopt a bipedal gait.

Matt Cartmill presents another problem with the ''Gigantopithecus'' hypothesis: &quot;The trouble with this account is that ''Gigantopithecus'' was not a hominin and maybe not even a crown-group hominoid; yet the physical evidence implies that Bigfoot is an upright biped with buttocks and a long, stout, permanently adducted hallux. These are hominin autapomorphies, not found in other mammals or other bipeds. It seems unlikely that ''Gigantopithecus'' would have evolved these uniquely [[hominini|hominin]] traits in parallel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Car08|Cartmill 2008]], p. 117&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernard G. Campbell wrote: &quot;That ''Gigantopithecus'' is in fact extinct has been questioned by those who believe it survives as the Yeti of the Himalayas and the Sasquatch of the north-west American coast. But the evidence for these creatures is not convincing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Humankind Emerging |last=Campbell |first=Bernard G.|year=1979 |publisher= Little, Brown and Company |id=Library of Congress Catalog Card No. 78-78234 |page=100 |isbn=0-673-52170-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extinct hominidae===
A species of ''[[Paranthropus]]'', such as ''[[Paranthropus robustus]]'', with its crested skull and bipedal gait, was suggested by [[Primatology|primatologist]] [[John R. Napier]] and anthropologist Gordon Strasenburg as a possible candidate for Bigfoot's identity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bfro.net/REF/scinafaq.htm |title=Scientific Names for Bigfoot |last=Coleman |first=Loren |publisher=BFRO |accessdate=August 19, 2008 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080909091922/http://www.bfro.net/REF/scinafaq.htm| archivedate= September 9, 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that fossils of ''Paranthropus'' are found only in Africa.

Michael Rugg, of the Bigfoot Discovery Museum, presented a comparison between human, ''Gigantopithecus'' and ''[[Meganthropus]]'' skulls (reconstructions made by [[Grover Krantz]]) in episodes 131 and 132 of the Bigfoot Discovery Museum Show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bigfootdiscoveryproject.com/media.php |title=Bigfoot Discovery Project Media |accessdate=April 4, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100419030214/http://www.bigfootdiscoveryproject.com/media.php| archivedate= April 19, 2010 | deadurl= no}} {{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He favorably compares a modern tooth suspected of coming from a Bigfoot to the ''Meganthropus'' fossil teeth, noting the worn enamel on the [[occlusion (dentistry)|occlusal]] surface. The ''Meganthropus'' fossils originated from Asia, and the tooth was found near Santa Cruz, California.

Some suggest [[Neanderthal]], ''[[Homo erectus]]'', or ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' to be the creature, but no remains of any of those species have been found in the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dae04|Daegling 2004]], p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific view==
The scientific community discounts the existence of Bigfoot, as there is no evidence supporting the survival of such a large, prehistoric ape-like creature. The evidence that does exist points more towards a hoax or delusion than to sightings of a genuine creature.&lt;ref name=&quot;skepdic&quot; /&gt; In a 1996 ''[[USA Today]]'' article, Washington State zoologist John Crane said, &quot;There is no such thing as Bigfoot. No data other than material that's clearly been fabricated has ever been presented.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodavage&quot;/&gt; In addition to the lack of evidence, scientists cite the fact that Bigfoot is alleged to live in regions unusual for a large, nonhuman primate, i.e., temperate latitudes in the northern hemisphere; all recognized apes are found in the [[tropics]] of Africa and Asia.

The subject of Bigfoot is not considered an area of credible science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=MjKkFG8qVjcC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=scientific+study+bigfoot#v=onepage&amp;q=scientific%20study%20bigfoot&amp;f=false|title=Intelligent design: William A. Dembski &amp; Michael Ruse in dialogue|author=Robert B. Stewart|page=83|isbn=9780800662189|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there have been a limited number of formal scientific studies of Bigfoot.

Supposed evidence, like the 1967 Patterson-Gimlin film, has provided &quot;no supportive data of any scientific value&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=G3z5VVbGfbgC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=pyle+bigfoot+-inauthor:pyle#v=onepage&amp;q=scientific&amp;f=false|title=Bigfoot exposed: an anthropologist examines America's enduring legend|author=David J. Daegling|isbn=9780759105393|date=October 30, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with other proposed megafauna cryptids, climate and food supply issues would make such a creature's survival in reported habitats unlikely.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sjögren, Bengt 1980&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= Sjögren, Bengt |title= ''Berömda vidunder'' |publisher= Settern |year= 1980 |isbn= 91-7586-023-6|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Great apes are not found in the fossil record in the Americas, and no Bigfoot remains are known to have been found. Scientific consensus is that the breeding population of such an animal would be so large that it would account for many more purported sightings than currently occur, making the existence of such an animal an almost certain impossibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;breedingpop&quot;/&gt; In the 1970s, when Bigfoot &quot;experts&quot; were frequently given high-profile media coverage, the scientific community generally avoided lending credence to the theories by debating them.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLeod 2009 4&quot;/&gt;

===Researchers===
[[Ivan T. Sanderson]] and [[Bernard Heuvelmans]] have spent parts of their career searching for Bigfoot.&lt;ref name=Sci99&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Science |date=November 5, 1999 |volume=286 |issue=5442 |page=1079|doi=10.1126/science.286.5442.1079c}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later scientists who researched the topic included [[Carleton S.

[[Jeffrey Meldrum]] has said that the fossil remains of an ancient giant ape called ''Gigantopithecus'' could turn out to be ancestors of today's commonly known Bigfoot, but this claim hasn't been accepted by the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=When Legend Meets Science: A Scientific analysis to the Sasquatch – or Bigfoot – debate|last=Meldrum |first=Jeffrey |authorlink=Jeffrey Meldrum |year=2006 |publisher=Johnson Books |isbn= 0-7653-1216-6 |page=320 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isu.edu/~meldd/fxnlmorph.html |title= Evaluation of Alleged Sasquatch Footprints and their Inferred Functional Morphology |accessdate=October 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; John Napier asserts that the scientific community's attitude towards Bigfoot stems primarily from insufficient evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nap73|Napier 1973]]&lt;/ref&gt; Other scientists who have shown varying degrees of interest in the legend are [[Patterson–Gimlin film#David J.

[[Jane Goodall]], in a September 27, 2002, interview on National Public Radio's &quot;Science Friday&quot;, expressed her ideas about the existence of Bigfoot. First stating &quot;I'm sure they exist&quot;, she later went on to say, chuckling, &quot;Well, I'm a romantic, so I always wanted them to exist&quot;, and finally: &quot;You know, why isn't there a body?

===Formal studies===
The first scientific study of available evidence was conducted by John Napier and published in his book, ''Bigfoot: The Yeti and Sasquatch in Myth and Reality,'' in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Napier, John. ''Bigfoot: The Yeti and Sasquatch in Myth and Reality.'' 1973, ISBN 0-525-06658-6&lt;/ref&gt; Napier wrote that if a conclusion is to be reached based on scant extant &quot;'hard' evidence,&quot; science must declare &quot;Bigfoot does not exist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Napier, 197&lt;/ref&gt; However, he found it difficult to entirely reject thousands of alleged tracks, &quot;scattered over 125,000 square miles&quot; or to dismiss all &quot;the many hundreds&quot; of eyewitness accounts. Napier concluded, &quot;I am convinced that Sasquatch exists, but whether it is all it is cracked up to be is another matter altogether. There must be ''something'' in north-west America that needs explaining, and that something leaves man-like footprints.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Napier, 205&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, the [[National Wildlife Federation]] funded a field study seeking Bigfoot evidence. No formal federation members were involved and the study made no notable discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;Bourne, Geoffrey H, ''The Gentle Giants: The Gorilla Story'' 1975, ISBN 0-399-11528-5, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 1970s, physical anthropologist [[Grover Krantz]] published several articles and four book-length treatments of Sasquatch. However, his work was found to contain multiple scientific failings including falling for hoaxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buhs|first=Joshua Blu|title=Bigfoot: The Life and Times of a Legend|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=RI4SlHwH7h0C&amp;pg=PA227|accessdate=November 10, 2014|date=August 1, 2009|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn=978-0-226-50215-1|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in for the [[Journal of Biogeography]] in 2009 by J.D. Lozier et al. used ecological niche modeling on reported sightings of Bigfoot, using their locations to infer Bigfoot's preferred ecological parameters. They found a very close match with the ecological parameters of the [[American black bear]], ''Ursus americanus''. They also note that an upright bear looks much like Bigfoot's purported appearance and consider it highly improbable that two species should have very similar ecological preferences, concluding that Bigfoot sightings are likely sightings of black bears.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lozier2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lozier|first1=J.

In the first ever systematic genetic analysis of 30 hair samples which were suspected to be from bigfoot, yeti, sasquatch, almasty or other anomalous primates, none was found to be primate in origin except that one sample is identified to be human.  A joint study by [[University of Oxford]] and [[Musée Cantonal de Zoologie |Lausanne’s Cantonal Museum of Zoology]] and published in the [[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] in 2014, the team used a previously published cleaning method to remove all surface contamination and the [[ribosomal]] [[mitochondrial DNA]] 12S fragment of the sample was sequenced and then compared to [[GenBank]] to identify the species origin.  The samples submitted were from different parts of the world, including USA, Russia, Himalayan region and Sumatra.  Other than one sample of human origin, all but two are from common animals.  Black and brown bear accounted for most of the samples, other animals include cow, horse, dog/wolf/coyote, sheep, goat, raccoon, porcupine, deer and tapir.  The last two samples matched a fossilized genetic sample of a 40,000 year old polar bear of the [[Pleistocene]] era. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sykes|first1=B|last2=Mullis|first2=R|last3=Hagenmuller|first3=C|last4=Melton|first4=T|last5=Sartori|first5=M|title=Genetic analysis of hair samples attributed to yeti, bigfoot and other anomalous primates|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=281|issue=1789|pages=|year=2 July 2014|publisher=The Royal Society|doi=10.1098/rspb.2014.0161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After what ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' described as &quot;a five-year study of purported Bigfoot (also known as Sasquatch) DNA samples,&quot;&lt;ref name=HuffingtonPost&gt;{{cite web|last=Speigel|first=Lee|title=Bigfoot DNA Tests: Science Journal's Credibility Called Into Question|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/14/bigfoot-dna-results-final_n_2681135.html|date=February 14, 2013|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=March 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texas veterinarian Melba Ketchum and her team announced that they had found proof that the Sasquatch &quot;is a human relative that arose approximately 15,000 years ago as a hybrid cross of modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' with an unknown primate species.&quot; Ketchum called for this to be recognized officially, saying that &quot;Government at all levels must recognize them as an indigenous people and immediately protect their human and Constitutional rights against those who would see in their physical and cultural differences a 'license' to hunt, trap, or kill them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholson&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Nicholson|first=Eric|title=A Texas Geneticist Apparently Invented a Science Journal to Publish Her DNA Proof of Bigfoot |url=http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/unfairpark/2013/02/a_texas_geneticist_apparently.php |accessdate=March 2, 2013 |newspaper=Dallas Observer|date=February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Failing to find a [[scientific journal]] that would publish their results, Ketchum announced on February 13, 2013 that their research had been published in the ''DeNovo Journal of Science''. ''The Huffington Post'' discovered that the journal's domain had been registered anonymously only nine days before the announcement. The only edition of DeNovo was listed as Volume 1, Issue 1, and its only content was the Bigfoot research.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ketchum |first=M.

==Bigfoot organizations==
There are several organizations dedicated to the research and investigation of Bigfoot sightings in the United States. The oldest and largest is the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO).&lt;ref name=&quot;BFRO&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://animal.discovery.com/tv-shows/finding-bigfoot/about-bigfoot/bigfoot-field-researchers-organization.htm | title=BFRO Animal Planet | publisher=Discovery Communications, LLC | accessdate=January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BFRO also provides a free database to individuals and other organizations. Their Web site includes reports from across North America that have been investigated by researchers to determine credibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bigfoot!:The True Story of Apes in America |last=Coleman |first=Loren |year=2003 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |page=233|isbn=1439187789 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
{{main|Bigfoot in popular culture}}
Bigfoot has had a demonstrable impact as a [[popular culture]] phenomenon. It has &quot;become entrenched in American popular culture and it is as viable an icon as Michael Jordan&quot; with more than forty-five years having passed since reported sightings in California, and neither an animal nor &quot;a satisfying explanation as to why folks see giant hairy men that don't exist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dae04|Daegling 2004]], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
