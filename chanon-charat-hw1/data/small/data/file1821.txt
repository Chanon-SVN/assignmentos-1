In 1836, the [[Georgia General Assembly]] voted to build the [[Western and Atlantic Railroad]] in order to provide a link between the port of [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] and the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].&lt;ref name=W&amp;ARR&gt;{{cite web | title = Creation of the Western and Atlantic Railroad | work=About North Georgia | publisher=Golden Ink | url = http://ngeorgia.com/railroads/warr01.html | accessdate=November 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial route was to run southward from Chattanooga to a terminus east of the [[Chattahoochee River]], which would then be linked to Savannah. After engineers surveyed various possible locations for the terminus, the &quot;zero milepost&quot; was driven into the ground in what is now [[Five Points (Atlanta)|Five Points]]. A year later, the area around the milepost had developed into a settlement, first known as &quot;Terminus&quot;, and later as &quot;Thrasherville&quot; after a local merchant who built homes and a [[general store]] in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu/gahistmarkers/thrashervillehistmarker.htm Thrasherville State Historical Marker], retrieved on November 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1842, the town had six buildings and 30 residents, and was renamed &quot;Marthasville&quot; to honor the [[Wilson Lumpkin|Governor's]] daughter.&lt;ref name=shorthistory&gt;{{cite web | title = A Short History of Atlanta: 1782–1859 | publisher=CITY-DIRECTORY, Inc. | date = September 22, 2007 | url = http://www.city-book.com/Overview/history/history1.htm | accessdate=December 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J.

In 1864, following the capture of Chattanooga, the [[Union Army]] moved southward and began its [[Atlanta campaign|invasion of north Georgia]]. The region surrounding Atlanta was the location of several major army [[battle]]s, culminating with the [[Battle of Atlanta]] and a four-month-long siege of the city by the [[Union Army]] under the command of General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]. On September 1, 1864, [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] General [[John Bell Hood]] made the decision to retreat from Atlanta, ordering all public buildings and possible assets to the Union Army destroyed. On the next day, Mayor [[James Calhoun]] surrendered Atlanta to the Union Army, and on September 7, General Sherman ordered the city's civilian population to evacuate. On November 11, 1864, in preparation of the Union Army's [[Sherman's March to the Sea|march to Savannah]], Sherman ordered Atlanta to be burned to the ground, sparing only the city's churches and hospitals.&lt;ref name=shorthistory2&gt;{{cite web | title = A Short History of Atlanta: 1860–1864 | publisher=CITY-DIRECTORY, Inc. | date= September 22, 2007 | url = http://www.city-book.com/Overview/history/history2.htm | accessdate=December 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] ended in 1865, Atlanta was gradually rebuilt. Due to the city's superior [[rail transportation]] network, the [[List of U.S. state historical capitals|state capital]] was moved to Atlanta from [[Milledgeville, Georgia|Milledgeville]] in 1868.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Jackson | first = Edwin L. | title = The Story of Georgia's Capitols and Capital Cities | publisher=Carl Vinson Institute of Government, University of Georgia | url = http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/capital.htm#anchor671763 | accessdate=November 13, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071009145856/http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/capital.htm#anchor671763 |archivedate = October 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1880 Census, Atlanta surpassed Savannah as Georgia's largest city.
Beginning in the 1880s, [[Henry W. Grady]], the editor of the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]'' newspaper, promoted Atlanta to potential investors as a city of the &quot;[[New South]]&quot; that would be based upon a modern economy and less reliant on agriculture. By 1885, the founding of the Georgia School of Technology (now [[History of Georgia Tech|Georgia Tech]]) and the city's black colleges had established the city as a center for higher education. In 1895, Atlanta hosted the [[Cotton States and International Exposition]], which attracted nearly 800,000 attendees and successfully promoted the New South's development to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F40813FB3C5811738DDDA10894DE405B8585F0D3|title=The South: Vast Resources, Rapid Development, Wonderful Opportunities for Capital and Labor...|work=[[New York Times]]|date=June 8, 1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first decades of the 20th century, Atlanta experienced a period of unprecedented growth. In three decades' time, Atlanta's population tripled as the city limits expanded to include nearby streetcar suburbs; the city's skyline emerged with the construction of the [[Equitable Building (Atlanta 1892)|Equitable]], [[Flatiron Building (Atlanta)|Flatiron]], [[J.

Atlanta played a vital role in the Allied effort during [[World War II]] due the city's war-related manufacturing companies, railroad network, and military bases, leading to rapid growth in the city's population and economy. In the 1950s, the city's newly constructed freeway system allowed middle class Atlantans the ability to relocate to the suburbs. As a result, the city began to make up an ever smaller proportion of the metropolitan area's population. {{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Most of Atlanta was burned during the Civil War, depleting the city of a large stock of its historic architecture. Yet architecturally, the city had never been particularly &quot;southern&quot;—because Atlanta originated as a railroad town, rather than a [[Aristocracy (class)|patrician]] southern seaport like [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] or [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], many of the city's landmarks could have easily been erected in the Northeast or Midwest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gournay&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Midtown HDR Atlanta.jpg|thumb|The skyline of Midtown (viewed from [[Piedmont Park]]) emerged with the construction of modernist [[Colony Square]] in 1972.]]
During the Cold War era, Atlanta embraced global modernist trends, especially regarding commercial and institutional architecture. Examples of [[modern architecture|modernist architecture]] include the [[Westin Peachtree Plaza]] (1976), [[Georgia-Pacific Tower]] (1982), the [[State of Georgia Building]] (1966), and the [[Atlanta Marriott Marquis]] (1985). In the latter half of the 1980s, Atlanta became one of the early adopters of postmodern designs that reintroduced classical elements to the cityscape. Many of Atlanta's tallest skyscrapers were built in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with most displaying tapering spires or otherwise ornamented crowns, such as [[One Atlantic Center]] (1987), [[191 Peachtree Tower]] (1991), and the [[Four Seasons Hotel Atlanta]] (1992). Also completed during the era is Atlanta's tallest skyscraper, the [[Bank of America Plaza (Atlanta)|Bank of America Plaza]] (1992), which, at {{convert|1023|ft|m|0}}, is the [[List of tallest buildings in the world|61st-tallest building in the world]] and the 9th-tallest building in the United States. The [[Bank of America Plaza (Atlanta)|Bank of America Plaza]] is currently the tallest building outside of [[New York City]] and [[Chicago]], and was the last building built in the United States to be in the top 10 tallest buildings in the world until [[One World Trade Center]] was completed externally on May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0001338.html|title=World's Tallest Buildings | publisher=Infoplease |accessdate=June 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city's embrace of modern architecture, however, translated into an ambivalent approach toward historic preservation, leading to the destruction of notable architectural landmarks, including the [[Equitable Building (Atlanta 1892)|Equitable Building]] (1892–1971), [[Terminal Station (Atlanta)|Terminal Station]] (1905–1972), and the [[Atlanta-Fulton Public Library System#The Carnegie Library|Carnegie Library]] (1902–1977).

Gentrification of the city's neighborhoods is one of the more controversial and transformative forces shaping contemporary Atlanta. The [[gentrification of Atlanta]] has its origins in the 1970s, after many of Atlanta's neighborhoods had undergone the urban decay that affected other major American cities in the mid-20th century. When neighborhood opposition successfully prevented two [[Interstate 485 (Georgia)|freeways]] from being built through city's the east side in 1975, the area became the starting point for Atlanta's [[gentrification]]. After Atlanta was awarded the Olympic games in 1990, [[gentrification]] expanded into other parts of the city, stimulated by infrastructure improvements undertaken in preparation for the games. Gentrification was also aided by the [[Atlanta Housing Authority]]'s eradication of the city's public housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Search Site |url=http://www.city-journal.org/2010/20_4_atlanta-public-housing.html |title=Atlanta's Public-Housing Revolution by Howard Husock, City Journal Autumn 2010 |publisher=City-journal.org |date= |accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gentrification of the city's neighborhoods has been the topic of social commentary, including ''[[The Atlanta Way (film)|The Atlanta Way]]'', a documentary detailing the negative effects gentrification has had on the city and its inhabitants.

The [[2010 United States Census]] reported that Atlanta had a population of 420,003. The [[population density]] was 3,154 per square mile (1232/km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The racial makeup and population of Atlanta was 54.0% Black or African American, 38.4% White, 3.1% Asian and 0.2% Native American. Those from some other race made up 2.2% of the city's population, while those from two or more races made up 2.0%.

In the 2010 Census, Atlanta was recorded as the nation's fourth largest majority black city, and the city has long been known as a center of African American political power, education, and culture, often called a [[black mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A CHAMPION FOR ATLANTA: Maynard Jackson: 'Black mecca' burgeoned under leader&quot;, ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'', June 29, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;the city that calls itself America's 'Black Mecca{{'&quot;}} in &quot;Atlanta Is Less Than Festive on Eve of Another 'Freaknik{{'&quot;}}, ''Washington Post'', April 18, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/us/atlanta-emerges-as-a-center-of-black-entertainment.html?pagewanted=all &quot;Atlanta emerges as a center of black entertainment&quot;, ''New York Times'', November 26, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[African Americans in Atlanta|African American Atlantans]] have rapidly suburbanized in recent decades, and from 2000 to 2010, the city's black population decreased by 31,678 people, shrinking from 61.4% of the city's population in 2000 to 54.0% in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;blogs.ajc.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;clatl.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Wheatley |first=Thomas |url=http://clatl.com/freshloaf/archives/2011/03/21/atlantas-census-numbers-reveal-dip-in-black-population-and-lots-of-people-who-mysteriously-vanished |title=Thomas Wheatley, &quot;Atlanta's census numbers reveal dip in black population – and lots of people who mysteriously vanished&quot;, Creative Loafing, March 21, 2011 |publisher=Clatl.com |date=March 21, 2011 |accessdate=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atlanta has recently undergone a drastic demographic increase in its white population. Between 2000 and 2010, the proportion of whites in the city's population grew faster than that of any other U.S. city. In that decade, Atlanta's white population grew from 31% to 38% of the city's population, an absolute increase of 22,753 people, more than triple the increase that occurred between 1990 and 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;blogs.ajc.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;clatl.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;clatl.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gurwitt |first=Rob |url=http://www.governing.com/articles/0807atlanta.htm |title=Governing Magazine: Atlanta and the Urban Future, July 2008 |publisher=Governing.com |date=July 1, 2008 |accessdate=April 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of the total population five years and older, 83.3% spoke only English at home, while 8.8% spoke Spanish, 3.9% another Indo-European language and 2.8% an Asian language.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Census 2008 American Community Survey&lt;/ref&gt; Atlanta's dialect has traditionally been a variation of [[Southern American English]].

[[Religion in Atlanta]], while historically centered on [[Protestant Christianity]], now involves many faiths as a result of the city and metro area's increasingly international population. While Protestant Christianity still maintains a strong presence in the city, in recent decades [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta|Catholicism]] has gained a strong foothold due to migration patterns. Metro Atlanta also has a considerable number of ethnic Christian congregations, including Korean and Indian churches. Large non-Christian faiths are present in the form of Judaism and Hinduism. Overall, there are over 1,000 places of worship within Atlanta.&lt;ref name=infoplease&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0108481.html|title=Atlanta, Ga. | work= Information Please Database | publisher= Pearson Education, Inc | accessdate=May 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atlanta began as a railroad town and [[logistics]] has remained a major component of the city's economy to this day. Atlanta is an important rail junction and contains major [[classification yard]]s for [[Norfolk Southern]] and [[CSX Transportation|CSX]]. Since its construction in the 1950s, [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport]] has served as a key engine of Atlanta's economic growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;allen&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen |first=Frederick |title=Atlanta Rising |year=1996 |publisher=Longstreet Press |location=Atlanta, Georgia |isbn=1-56352-296-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Delta Air Lines]], the city's largest employer and the metro area's third largest, operates the world's largest airline hub at [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport]] and has helped make Hartsfield-Jackson the [[world's busiest airport]], both in terms of passenger traffic and aircraft operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=[[Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce]] | title = Atlanta's top employers, 2006 | url=http://www.metroatlantachamber.com/macoc/business/img/TopEmployers2006.pdf | accessdate=August 8, 2007 |format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070225123824/http://www.metroatlantachamber.com/macoc/business/img/TopEmployers2006.pdf |archivedate = February 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly due to the airport, Atlanta has become a hub for diplomatic missions; as of 2012, the city contains 25 general consulates, the seventh-highest [[List of diplomatic missions in Atlanta|concentration of diplomatic missions]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgia.org/BusinessInGeorgia/InternationalBusiness/Pages/Consulates.aspx |title=Consulates &amp; Consular Services |publisher=Georgia.org |accessdate=June 27, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110716041101/http://www.georgia.org/BusinessInGeorgia/InternationalBusiness/Pages/Consulates.aspx| archivedate= July 16, 2011 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media is also an important aspect of Atlanta's economy. The city is a major [[cable TV|cable television]] programming center. [[Ted Turner]] established the headquarters of both the [[Cable News Network]] (CNN) and the [[Turner Broadcasting System]] (TBS) in Atlanta. [[Cox Enterprises]], the country's third-largest cable television service and the publisher of over a dozen major American newspapers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = About Cox  | publisher=Cox Communications, Inc  | url = http://www.cox.com/about/  | accessdate=August 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; is headquartered in the city.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.coxinc.com/corp/presscenter/viewPressRelease.asp?articleid=575 Cox Enterprises, Inc.

Information technology, an economic sector that includes publishing, software development, entertainment and data processing has garnered a larger percentage of Atlanta's economic output. Indeed, Atlanta has been nicknamed the [[Silicon peach]] due to its burgeoning technology sector.  As of 2013, Atlanta contains the fourth-largest concentration of information technology jobs in the United States, numbering 85,000. Atlanta also ranks as the sixth-fastest growing city for information technology jobs, with an employment growth of 4.8% in 2012 and a three-year growth near 9%, or 16,000 jobs.

== Culture ==
[[File:Museum oF Design Atlanta.jpg|thumb|The Museum of Design Atlanta (MODA)]]
Atlanta, while located in the [[Southern United States|South]], has a culture that is no longer strictly [[Culture of the Southern United States|Southern]]. This is due to a large population of migrants from other parts of the U.S., in addition to many recent [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants to the U.S.]] who have made the metropolitan area their home, establishing Atlanta as the cultural and economic hub of an increasingly [[Multi-culturalism|multi-cultural]] metropolitan area.&lt;ref&gt;18.6% of City of Atlanta born in US outside South and 8.0% foreign born (compare to 7.1%/3.0% for Macon, GA and 7.7%/3.2% for Birmingham, AL): [http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml PLACE OF BIRTH BY CITIZENSHIP STATUS, 2010 ACS 1-year estimates, U.S. Census American Fact Finder]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garner |first=Marcus K. |url=http://www.ajc.com/news/foreign-born-population-continues-780806.html |title=Foreign-born population continues to grow in metro Atlanta |publisher=ajc.com |date=December 18, 2010 |accessdate=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, although traditional Southern culture is part of Atlanta's cultural fabric, it is mostly the backdrop to one of the nation's most cosmopolitan cities. This unique cultural combination reveals itself in the arts district of Midtown, the quirky neighborhoods on the city's [[Eastside (Atlanta)|eastside]], and the multi-ethnic enclaves found along [[Buford Highway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frommers.com/destinations/atlanta/0002010001.html |title=Introduction in Atlanta at Frommer's |publisher=Frommers.com |accessdate=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arts and theater ===
{{Main|Arts in Atlanta}}
Atlanta is one of few United States cities with permanent, professional, resident companies in all major performing arts disciplines: opera ([[Atlanta Opera]]), ballet ([[Atlanta Ballet]]), music ([[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra]]), and theater (the [[Alliance Theatre]]).

Atlanta's performing arts district is concentrated in [[Midtown Atlanta]] at the [[Woodruff Arts Center]], which is home to the [[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Alliance Theatre]]. The city also frequently hosts touring Broadway acts, especially at The [[Fox Theatre (Atlanta, Georgia)|Fox Theatre]], a historic landmark that is among the highest grossing theatres of its size.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;1988: ''Performance'' magazine names the Fox Theatre the number one grossing theatre in the 3,000–5,000 seat category with the most events, the greatest box office receipts, and the highest attendance in the U.S.&quot; and &quot;2009: Billboard magazine names the Fox the No. 1 non-residency theatre for the decade with 5,000 seats or less.&quot; on [http://www.foxtheatre.org/foxtimeline.aspx ''Timeline'', Fox Theatre website]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[List of capitals in the United States|state capital]], Atlanta is the site of most of Georgia's state government. The [[Georgia State Capitol]] building, located downtown, houses the offices of the [[Governor of Georgia|governor]], lieutenant governor and secretary of state, as well as the [[Georgia General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The [[Georgia Governor's Mansion|Governor's Mansion]] is located in a residential section of Buckhead.

Historically, Atlanta has been a stronghold for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Although municipal elections are officially nonpartisan, nearly all of the city's elected officials are registered Democrats. The city is split between 14 state house districts and four state senate districts, all held by Democrats. At the federal level, Atlanta is split between two congressional districts. The northern three-fourths of the city is located in the 5th district, represented by Democrat [[John Lewis (U.S. politician)|John Lewis]]. The southern fourth is in the 13th district, represented by Democrat [[David Scott (Georgia politician)|David Scott]].

The city is served by the [[Atlanta Police Department]], which numbers 2,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myajc.com/news/news/local/apd-reaches-a-once-elusive-goal-of-2000-officers/ | title=APD reaches a once-elusive goal of 2,000 officers}}&lt;/ref&gt; officers and oversaw a 40% decrease in the city's crime rate between 2001 and 2009.

[[Georgia State University]], a public research university located in [[Downtown Atlanta]], is the second largest of the 35 colleges and universities in the University System of Georgia and a major contributor to the revitalization of the city's central business district. Atlanta is also home to nationally renowned private colleges and universities, most notably [[Emory University]], a leading liberal arts and research institution that ranks among the top 20 schools in the United States and operates [[Emory Healthcare]], the largest health care system in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

== Media ==
{{Main|Media in Atlanta}}
The primary network-affiliated television stations in Atlanta are [[WXIA-TV]] (NBC), [[WGCL-TV]] (CBS), [[WSB-TV]] (ABC), and [[WAGA-TV]] (Fox). The Atlanta metropolitan area is served by two public television stations and one public radio station. [[WGTV]] is the flagship station of the statewide [[Georgia Public Television]] network and is a [[Public Broadcast Service|PBS]] member station, while [[WPBA (TV)|WPBA]] is owned by [[Atlanta Public Schools]]. Georgia Public Radio is listener-funded and comprises one [[NPR]] member station, [[WABE]], a classical music station operated by [[Atlanta Public Schools]].

Atlanta is served by the ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', its only major daily newspaper with wide distribution. The ''Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' is the result of a 1950 merger between ''The Atlanta Journal'' and ''The Atlanta Constitution'', with staff consolidation occurring in 1982 and separate publication of the morning ''Constitution'' and afternoon ''Journal'' ceasing in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-1807 |title=New Georgia Encyclopedia: Atlanta Journal-Constitution |publisher=Georgiaencyclopedia.org |date= |accessdate=July 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alternative weekly]] newspapers include ''[[Creative Loafing (Atlanta)|Creative Loafing]]'', which has a weekly print circulation of 80,000.

[[File:ATL airport interior.jpg|thumb|Concourse B at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the world's busiest airport]]
[[File:Bright Atlanta.jpg|thumb|The [[Downtown Connector]], seen at night in Midtown.]]
Atlanta's transportation infrastructure comprises a complex network that includes a [[heavy rail]] subway system, a [[streetcar]] line, multiple interstate highways, the world's busiest airport, and over {{convert|45|mi|0|abbr=off}} of bike paths.

The [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority]] (MARTA) provides public transportation in the form of buses and heavy rail. Notwithstanding heavy automotive usage in Atlanta, the city's [[rapid transit|subway]] system is the [[List of United States Rapid Transit systems by Ridership|eighth busiest in the country]].&lt;ref name=APTA&gt;American Public Transportation Association, [http://www.apta.com/research/stats/ridership/riderep/documents/07q4hr.pdf Heavy Rail Transit Ridership Report], Fourth Quarter 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; MARTA rail lines connect many key destinations, such as the airport, Downtown, Midtown, Buckhead, and Perimeter Center. However, significant destinations, such as Emory University, [[Cumberland, Georgia|Cumberland]] and Turner Field, remain unserved. As a result, a 2012 [[Brookings Institution]] study placed Atlanta 87th of 100 metro areas for transit accessibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2012/07/11-transit-jobs-tomer/~/media/Research/Files/Papers/2012/7/transit%20labor%20tomer/pdf/Atlanta.pdf|title=&quot;Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Marietta, GA Metro Area&quot;, part of &quot;Missed Opportunity: Transit and Jobs in Metropolitan America&quot;, Brookings Institute |format=PDF |date=June 2012|accessdate=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emory University]] operates its [[The Cliff (Emory)|Cliff]] shuttle buses with 200,000 boardings per month, while private [[minibus]]es ply [[Buford Highway]].
