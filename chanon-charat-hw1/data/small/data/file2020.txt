Bosnia and Herzegovina is a region that traces permanent human settlement back to the [[Neolithic]] age, during and after which it was populated by several [[Illyria]]n and [[Celts|Celtic]] civilizations. Culturally, politically, and socially, the country has one of the richest histories in the region, having been first settled by the [[Slavic peoples]] that populate the area today from the 6th through to the 9th centuries CE. They then established the first independent [[ban (title)|ban]]ate in the region, known as the [[Banate of Bosnia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Paul Mojzes. Religion and the war in Bosnia.

The Ottomans brought [[Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Islam]] to the region, and altered much of the cultural and social outlook of the country. This was followed by [[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1878–1918)|annexation into the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]], which lasted up until [[World War I]]. In the interwar period, Bosnia was part of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and after [[World War II]], the country was granted full republic status in the newly formed [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. Following the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the country [[Breakup of Yugoslavia#Independence of the Republic of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina|proclaimed independence]] in 1992, which was followed by the [[Bosnian War]], lasting until late 1995.

Today, the country maintains high [[List of countries by Human Development Index|literacy, life expectancy and education]] levels and is one of the [[Tourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina|most frequently visited countries in the region]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/bosnia-and-hercegovina |title=Lonely Planet's Bosnia and Herzegovina Tourism Profile |publisher=Lonely Planet}}&lt;/ref&gt; projected to have the third highest tourism growth rate in the world between 1995 and 2020.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newfound&quot;&gt;[http://features.us.reuters.com/destinations/news/L20239376.html Bosnia's newfound tourism], [[Reuters]].&lt;/ref&gt; Bosnia and Herzegovina is regionally and internationally renowned for its natural beauty and [[Culture of Bosnia and Herzegovina|cultural heritage]] inherited from six historical civilizations, its [[Bosnia and Herzegovina cuisine|cuisine]], [[Tourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina#Winter sports|winter sports]], its eclectic and unique [[Music of Bosnia and Herzegovina|music]], [[Architecture of Bosnia and Herzegovina|architecture]] and its [[Sarajevo#Festivals|festivals]], some of which are the largest and most prominent of their kind in Southeastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sff.ba/content.php/en/festival?set_culture=en |title=About the Sarajevo Film Festival |publisher=Sarajevo Film Festival Official Website}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidefilm.com/europe.html |title=Inside Film's Guide to Film Festivals in  |publisher=Inside Film}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country is home to three ethnic groups or, officially, [[Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina|constituent peoples]], a term unique for Bosnia and Herzegovina. [[Bosniaks]] are the largest group of the three, with [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Serbs]] second and [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Croats]] third. Regardless of ethnicity, a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina is often identified in English as a [[Bosnians|Bosnian]]. The terms [[Herzegovina|Herzegovinian]] and [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]n are maintained as a regional rather than ethnic distinction, and the region of Herzegovina has no precisely defined borders of its own. Moreover, the country was simply called &quot;Bosnia&quot; until the Austro-Hungarian occupation at the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utoronto.ca/tsq/03/vinko.shtml |title=The Language Situation in Post-Dayton Bosnia and Herzegovina |publisher=Toronto Slavic Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosnia and Herzegovina has a [[bicameral]] legislature and a three-member Presidency composed of a member of each major ethnic group. However, the central government's power is highly limited, as the country is largely decentralized and comprises two autonomous entities: the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Republika Srpska]], with a third region, the [[Brčko District]], governed under local government. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is itself complex and consists of 10 federal units – [[Cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|cantons]]. The country is a [[Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union|potential candidate for membership to the European Union]] and has been a candidate for [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] membership since April 2010, when it received a [[Membership Action Plan]] at a summit in [[Tallinn]]. Additionally, the country has been a member of the [[Council of Europe]] since April 2002 and a founding member of the [[Union for the Mediterranean|Mediterranean Union]] upon its establishment in July 2008.

== Etymology ==&lt;!--linked [where?]--&gt;

The first preserved mention of the name &quot;Bosnia&quot; is in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', a politico-geographical handbook written by the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Constantine VII]] in the mid-10th century (between 948 and 952) describing the &quot;small country&quot; (χωρίον in [[Greek language|Greek]]) of &quot;Bosona&quot; (Βοσώνα).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thezaurus.com/sloveniana/glagolitic_script.htm |title=De administrando imperio |publisher=Thezaurus.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja]] from 1172–96 of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bar|Bar's Roman Catholic Christian Archbishop]] names Bosnia, and references an earlier source from the year of 753 – the De Regno Sclavorum (Of the Realm of Slavs). The name &quot;Bosnia&quot; probably comes from the name of the [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]] river around which it has been historically based, which was recorded in the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]] under the name ''Bossina''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;&gt;Malcolm, Noel (1994). Bosnia A Short History. New York University Press. ISBN 0-8147-5520-8.&lt;/ref&gt; More direct roots of the river's names are unknown. Philologist Anton Mayer proposed a connection with the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root ''*bos'' or ''*bogh'', meaning &quot;running water&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Imamovic&quot;&gt;Imamović, Mustafa (1996). Historija Bošnjaka. Sarajevo: BZK Preporod. ISBN 9958-815-00-1&lt;/ref&gt; Certain [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sources similarly mention ''Bathinus flumen'' as a name of the [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]] ''Bosona'', both of which would mean &quot;flowing water&quot; as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Imamovic&quot;/&gt; Other theories involve the rare [[Latin]] term ''Bosina'', meaning boundary, and possible [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] origins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Imamovic&quot;/&gt;

The origins of the name ''Herzegovina'' may be identified with greater precision. In the [[Middle Ages#Early Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]] the corresponding region was known as [[Zahumlje]] (Hum), after the ''Zachlumoi'' tribe of southern Slavs which inhabited it. In the 1440s, the region – adjoined to medieval Bosnia since the early 1300s – was ruled by the powerful Bosnian nobleman [[Stjepan Vukčić Kosača|Stephen Vukčić Kosača]]. In 1448, Kosača dropped the title &quot;[[Voivode]] of Bosnia&quot; and instead assumed the title &quot;Herceg (Herzog) of Hum and the Coast&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Fine | first=John Van Antwerp | page=578 | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LvVbRrH1QBgC&amp;pg=PA578| title=The Late Medieval Balkans: A Critical Survey from the Late Twelfth Century to the Ottoman Conquest | year=1994 | publisher=University of Michigan Press | isbn=9780472082605}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herzog being the German word for &quot;[[duke]]&quot;, and so the lands he controlled would later be known as ''Herzegovina'' (&quot;Dukedom&quot;, from the addition of ''-ovina'', &quot;land&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt; The region was administered by the Ottomans as the [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]] (Hersek) within the [[Eyalet of Bosnia]] up until the formation of the short-lived [[Herzegovina Eyalet]] in the 1830s. Following the death of its founder and ruler [[vizier]] [[Ali-paša Rizvanbegović]] in the 1850s, the two eyalets were merged, and the new joint-entity was thereafter commonly referred to as Bosnia and Herzegovina.

On initial proclamation of independence in 1992 the country's official name was the ''[[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]'' but following the 1995 [[Dayton Agreement]] and the new constitution that accompanied it the name was officially changed to ''Bosnia and Herzegovina''.

===Early history===
{{main|Early history of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
Bosnia has been inhabited since at latest the [[Neolithic]] age. The earliest Neolithic population became known in the [[Classical Antiquity|Antiquity]] as the [[Illyrians]]. [[Celts|Celtic]] migrations in the 4th century&amp;nbsp;BC were also notable. Concrete historical evidence for this period is scarce, but overall it appears that the region was populated by a number of different peoples speaking distinct languages. Conflict between the Illyrians and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] started in 229&amp;nbsp;BC, but Rome did not complete its annexation of the region until AD&amp;nbsp;9.

[[File:Daorson.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Walls of ancient [[Daorson]], Ošanići, near [[Stolac]], Bosnia and Herzegovina (3rd century BC).]]
It was precisely in what is now Bosnia and Herzegovina that Rome fought one of the most difficult battles in its history since the [[Punic Wars]], as described by the Roman historian [[Suetonius]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], Tiberius 16,17&lt;/ref&gt; This was the Roman campaign against the revolt of indigenous communities from [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], known in history as the [[Great Illyrian Revolt]], and also as the [[Pannonian revolt]], or [[Bellum Batonianum]], the latter named after two leaders of the rebellious Illyrian communities, [[Bato I|Bato]] of the [[Daesitiates]], and Bato of the [[Breuci]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Norma. Tacitus: Annals I, 2002, ISBN 1-85399-358-1. It had originally been joined to Illyricum, but after the great Illyrian/Pannonian revolt of AD 6 it was made a separate province with its own governor&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Illyrian revolt was a rising up of Illyrians against the Romans, more specifically a revolt against [[Tiberius]]' attempt to recruit them for his war against the [[Germans]]. The Illyrians put up a fierce resistance to the most powerful army on earth at the time (the [[Roman Army]]) for four years (AD 6 to AD 9), but they were finally subdued by Rome in AD 9.

The last Illyrian stronghold, of which their defence won the admiration of Roman historians, is said to have been Arduba.&lt;ref&gt;Stipčević, Aleksandar, The Illyrians-History and Culture, 1974, Noyess Press&lt;/ref&gt; Bato of Daesitiates was captured and taken to Italy. It is alleged that when Tiberius asked Bato and the Daesitiates why they had rebelled, Baton was reputed to have answered: &quot;''You Romans are to blame for this; for you send as guardians of your flocks, not dogs or shepherds, but wolves''.&quot; Bato spent the rest of his life in the Italian town of Ravenna.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Roman period, Latin-speaking settlers from the entire [[Roman Empire]] settled among the Illyrians, and Roman soldiers were encouraged to retire in the region.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |last=Malcolm |first=Noel |title=Bosnia: A Short History |publisher=[[New York University Press]] |year=1996 |chapter=|isbn=0-8147-5561-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The land was originally part of [[Illyria]] up until the Roman occupation. Following the split of the Roman Empire between 337 and 395 AD, Dalmatia and Pannonia became parts of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. Some claim that the region was conquered by the [[Ostrogoths]] in 455 AD. It subsequently changed hands between the [[Alans]] and the [[Huns]]. By the 6th century, Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]] had reconquered the area for the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Illyrians were conquered by the [[European Avars|Avars]] in the 6th century.

However, the Illyrians did not entirely vanish from Bosnia and Herzegovina with the arrival of new cultures. A large part of the remaining Illyrian culture intermingled with those of new settlers,  some of it is believed to have been adopted by the latter, and some survived up to date, such as architectural remains (e.g. [[Daorson]] near [[Stolac]]), certain customs and traditions (e.g.tattooing, the 'gluha kola' dances, the 'ganga' singing, zig-zag and concentric circles in traditional decorations),  place names (e.g. [[Čapljina]], from 'čaplja', a south Slavic word for 'heron', coincides with 'Ardea', a [[Latin]]  word for 'heron', and 'Ardea', in turn, bears striking similarity with the name of [[Ardiaei]], the native Illyrian people of the wider Neretva valley region, where the town of Čapljina is situated), etc.&lt;ref&gt;Adzanela (Axhanela) Ardian, ''Illyrian Bosnia and Herzegovina-an overview of a cultural legacy'', 2004, Centre for Balkan Studies, Online Balkan Centre : http://www.academia.edu/2490281/Illyrian_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina-an_Overview_of_a_Cultural_Legacy_Ancient_Illyrians_of_Bosnia_and_Herzegovina&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Medieval Bosnia}}
Modern knowledge of the political situation in the west Balkans into the region in the late 9th century is scarce. The [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes also brought their mythology and pagan system of beliefs, the ''Rodovjerje''. In particular, [[Perun]] / [[Перун]], the highest god of the pantheon and the god of thunder and lightning is also commonly found in Bosnian toponymy, for instance in the name of ''Mount Perun'' (''Perunova Gora'' / ''Перунова Гора''). Along with the Slavic settlers, the native Illyrians were [[Christianization|Christianized]]. Bosnia and Herzegovina, because of its geographic position and terrain, was probably one of the last areas to go through this process, which presumably originated from the urban centers along the Dalmatian coast. Thus, Slavic Bosnian tribes remained pagans for a longer time, and finally converted to Christianity {{when|date=December 2013}}.

The principalities of [[Serbia]] and [[Croatia]] split control of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 9th and 10th centuries, but by the [[High Middle Ages]] political circumstance led to the area being contested between the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and the Byzantine Empire. Following another shift of power between the two in the early 12th century, Bosnia found itself outside the control of both and emerged as an [[Banate of Bosnia|independent state]] under the rule of local ''[[Ban (title)|bans]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;

The first Bosnian monarch was [[Ban Borić]]. The second was [[Ban Kulin]] whose rule marked the start of a controversy involving the [[Bosnian Church]], because he allowed an indigenous [[Bogomilism]] sect considered heretical by the Roman Catholic Church. In response to Hungarian attempts to use church politics regarding the issue as a way to reclaim sovereignty over Bosnia, Kulin held a council of local church leaders to renounce the heresy and embraced Catholicism in 1203. Despite this, Hungarian ambitions remained unchanged long after Kulin's death in 1204, waning only after an unsuccessful invasion in 1254.

Bosnian history from then until the early 14th century was marked by a power struggle between the [[Šubić]] and [[House of Kotromanić|Kotromanić]] families. This conflict came to an end in 1322, when [[Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia|Stephen II Kotromanić]] became ''Ban''. By the time of his death in 1353, he was successful in annexing territories to the north and west, as well as Zahumlje and parts of Dalmatia. He was succeeded by his ambitious nephew [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko]] who, following a prolonged struggle with nobility and inter-family strife, gained full control of the country in 1367. By the year 1377, Bosnia was elevated into a kingdom with the coronation of Tvrtko as the first [[List of rulers of Bosnia|Bosnian King]] in Mile near [[Visoko during the Middle Ages|Visoko]] in the Bosnian heartland.&lt;ref name=Mile&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aneks8komisija.com.ba/main.php?id_struct=6&amp;lang=1&amp;action=view&amp;id=1341|title=declared as national monument}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=An&gt;Anđelić Pavao, Krunidbena i grobna crkva bosanskih vladara u Milima (Arnautovićima) kod Visokog.

Following his death in 1391 however, Bosnia fell into a long period of decline. The [[Ottoman Empire]] had already started its [[Ottoman wars in Europe|conquest of Europe]] and posed a major threat to the [[Balkans]] throughout the first half of the 15th century. Finally, after decades of political and social instability, the Kingdom of Bosnia ceased to exist in 1463 after its conquest by the Ottoman Empire.

The Ottoman conquest of Bosnia marked a new era in the country's history and introduced drastic changes in the political and [[cultural landscape]]. The Ottomans allowed for the preservation of Bosnia's identity by incorporating it as an integral province of the Ottoman Empire with its historical name and territorial integrity&amp;nbsp;— a unique case among subjugated states in the Balkans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riedlmayer&quot;&gt;Riedlmayer, Andras (1993). [http://www.kakarigi.net/manu/briefhis.htm A Brief History of Bosnia-Herzegovina]. The Bosnian Manuscript Ingathering Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Bosnia the Ottomans introduced a number of key changes in the territory's socio-political administration; including a new landholding system, a reorganization of administrative units, and a complex system of social differentiation by class and religious affiliation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;

The four centuries of Ottoman rule also had a drastic impact on Bosnia's population make-up, which changed several times as a result of the empire's conquests, frequent wars with European powers, forced and economic migrations, and epidemics. A native Slavic-speaking Muslim community emerged and eventually became the largest of the ethno-religious groups due to lack of strong Christian church organizations and continuous rivalry between the Orthodox and Catholic churches, while the indigenous [[Bosnian Church]] disappeared altogether (ostensibly by conversion of its members to Islam). The Ottomans referred to them as ''kristianlar'' while the Orthodox and Catholics were called ''gebir'' or ''kafir'', meaning &quot;unbeliever&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Rf8P-7ExoKYC&amp;pg=PA29|title=''Religious Separation and Political Intolerance in Bosnia-Herzegovina''|author=Mitja Velikonja |year=2003|work= |publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press |accessdate=}}, pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bosnian [[Franciscan]]s (and the Catholic population as a whole) were to a minor extent protected by official imperial decree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;

As the Ottoman Empire continued their rule in the [[Balkans]] ([[Rumelia]]), Bosnia was somewhat relieved of the pressures of being a frontier province, and experienced a period of general welfare. A number of cities, such as Sarajevo and [[Mostar]], were established and grew into regional centers of trade and [[urban culture]] and were then visited by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] traveler [[Evliya Çelebi]] in 1648. Within these cities, various Ottoman Sultans financed the construction of many works of [[Architecture of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian architecture]] such as the country's first library in [[Sarajevo]], [[madrassa]]s, a school of [[Sufi philosophy]], and a [[clock tower]] (''Sahat Kula''){{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}, bridges such as the [[Stari Most]], the [[Tsar's Mosque]] and the [[Gazi Husrev-beg's Mosque]].

Furthermore, several Bosnian Muslims played influential roles in the Ottoman Empire's cultural and [[political history]] during this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riedlmayer&quot;/&gt; Bosnian recruits formed a large component of the Ottoman ranks in the battles of [[Battle of Mohács|Mohács]] and [[Battle of Krbava field|Krbava field]], while numerous other Bosnians rose through the ranks of the Ottoman military to occupy the highest positions of power in the Empire, including admirals such as [[Matrakçı Nasuh]]; generals such as [[Isa-Beg Isaković]], [[Gazi Husrev-beg]] and [[Hasan Predojević]] and [[Sarı Süleyman Paşa]]; administrators such as [[Ferhat-paša Sokolović]] and [[Osman Gradaščević]]; and [[Vizier|Grand Viziers]] such as the influential [[Mehmed Paša Sokolović]] and [[Damad Ibrahim Pasha]]. Some Bosnians emerged as [[Sufi]] mystics, scholars such as [[Muhamed Hevaji Uskufi Bosnevi]], [[Ali Džabič]]; and poets in the [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Arabic]], and [[Persian language]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Imamovic&quot;/&gt;

However, by the late 17th century the Empire's military misfortunes caught up with the country, and the conclusion of the [[Great Turkish War]] with the [[treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699 once again made Bosnia the Empire's westernmost province. The following century was marked by further military failures, numerous revolts within Bosnia, and several outbursts of plague{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}. The Porte's efforts at modernizing the Ottoman state were met with distrust growing to hostility in Bosnia, where local aristocrats stood to lose much through the proposed reforms{{clarify|date=September 2014}}{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}.

This, combined with frustrations over territorial, political concessions in the north-east, and the plight of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] [[Muslim]] refugees arriving from the [[Sanjak of Smederevo]] into [[Bosnia Eyalet]], culminated in a partially unsuccessful revolt by [[Husein Gradaščević]], who endorsed a multicultural [[Bosnia Eyalet]] autonomous from the authoritarian rule of the Ottoman Sultan [[Mahmud II]], who persecuted, executed and abolished the [[Janissaries]] and reduced the role of autonomous [[Pasha]]'s in [[Rumelia]]. Mahmud II sent his [[Grand Vizier]] to subdue Bosnia Eyalet and succeeded only with the reluctant assistance of [[Ali-paša Rizvanbegović]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Imamovic&quot;/&gt; Related rebellions would be extinguished by 1850, but the situation continued to deteriorate. Later agrarian unrest eventually sparked the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875-1878)|Herzegovinian rebellion]], a widespread peasant uprising, in 1875. The conflict rapidly spread and came to involve several Balkan states and Great Powers, a situation which eventually led to the [[Congress of Berlin]] and the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1878.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;

At the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Foreign Minister [[Gyula Andrássy]] obtained the occupation and administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and he also obtained the right to station garrisons in the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]], which remained under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] administration. The Sanjak preserved the separation of Serbia and Montenegro, and the Austro-Hungarian garrisons there would open the way for a dash to [[Salonika]] that &quot;would bring the western half of the Balkans under permanent Austrian influence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Albertini|first=Luigi|title=The Origins of the War of 1914, Volume I|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1952|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;High [Austro-Hungarian] military authorities desired [an...] immediate major expedition with Salonika as its objective.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Albertini 1952 33&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Albertini|first=Luigi|title=The Origins of the War of 1914, Volume I|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1952|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On 28 September 1878 the Finance Minister, Koloman von Zell, threatened to resign if the army, backed by the [[Archduke Albrecht, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Albert]], were allowed to advance to Salonika. In the session of the Hungarian Parliament of 5 November 1878 the Opposition proposed that the Foreign Minister should be impeached for violating the constitution with his policy during the Near East Crisis and by the occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The motion lost 179 to 95. The gravest accusations were raised by the opposition rank and file against Andrassy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albertini 1952 33&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although an Austro-Hungarian side quickly came to an agreement with Bosnians, tensions remained in certain parts of the country (particularly the south) and a mass emigration of predominantly Slavic dissidents occurred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt; However, a state of relative stability was reached soon enough and Austro-Hungarian authorities were able to embark on a number of social and administrative reforms which intended to make Bosnia and Herzegovina into a &quot;model colony&quot;.

With the aim of establishing the province as a stable [[political spectrum|political model]] that would help dissipate rising South Slav nationalism, Habsburg rule did much to codify laws, to introduce new political practices, and to provide for modernisation. The Austro-Hungarian Empire built the three Roman Catholic churches in Sarajevo and these three churches are among only 20 Catholic churches in the state of Bosnia.{{Dubious|date=August 2014}}{{citation needed|reason=Quite incorrect.

In 1881, within three years of formal occupation of Bosnia Herzegovina, Austria-Hungary obtained German and the more important Russian approval of the annexation of these provinces at a time that suited Vienna. This mandate was formally ratified by the [[League of the Three Emperors|Dreikaiserbund (Three Emperor's Treaty)]] on 18 June of that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albertini17&quot;&gt;L.Albertini, The Origins of the War of 1914, vol 1, (New York, 2005), p37, ISBN 1-929631-31-6&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the accession of Czar Nicholas II, however, the Russians reneged on the agreement, asserting in 1897 the need for special scrutiny of the Bosnian Annexation issue at an unspecified future date.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albertini19&quot;&gt;L.Albertini, The Origins of the War of 1914, vol 1, (New York, 2005), p94, ISBN 1-929631-31-6&lt;/ref&gt;

External matters began to affect the Bosnian Protectorate, however, and its relationship with Austria-Hungary. A bloody coup occurred in Serbia, on 10 June 1903, which brought a radical anti-Austrian government into power in Belgrade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albertini70&quot;&gt;L.Albertini, The Origins of the War of 1914, vol 1, (New York, 2005), p140, ISBN 1-929631-31-6&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the revolt in the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1908, raised concerns that the Istanbul government might seek the outright return of Bosnia Herzegovina. These factors caused the Austrian-Hungarian government to seek a permanent resolution of the Bosnian question sooner, rather than later.[[File:Archduke Eugen Bosniaks.jpg|thumb|left|Bosniaks were [[Bosnian-Herzegovinian Infantry|drafted into elite units]] of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] as early as 1879 and were commended for their bravery in service of the Austrian emperor, winning more medals than any other unit. The jaunty military march ''[[Die Bosniaken Kommen (March)|Die Bosniaken Kommen]]'' (&quot;The Bosniaks are coming&quot;) was composed by [[Eduard Wagnes]] in their honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XkLDVyYZPBYC&amp;pg=PA264| title=The Enemy at the Gate: Habsburgs, Ottomans and the Battle for Europe|page= 264 |first=Andrew |last=Wheatcroft|publisher=Basic Books|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schachinger&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Werner Schachinger|title=Die Bosniaken kommen: Elitetruppe in der k.u.k.

On 2 July 1908, in response to the pressing of the Austrian-Hungarian claim, the Russian Imperial Foreign Minister Alexander Izvolsky offered to support the Bosnian annexation in return for Vienna's support for Russia's bid for naval access through the [[Dardanelles]] Straits into the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albertini71&quot;&gt;L.Albertini, The Origins of the War of 1914, vol 1, (New York, 2005), p195, ISBN 1-929631-31-6&lt;/ref&gt; With the Russians being, at least, provisionally willing to keep their word over Bosnia Herzegovina for the first time in 11 years, Austria-Hungary waited and then published the annexation proclamation on 6 October 1908. The international furor over the annexation announcement caused Izvolsky to drop the Dardanelles Straits question, altogether, in an effort to obtain a European conference over the Bosnian Annexation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albertini72&quot;&gt;L.Albertini, The Origins of the War of 1914, vol 1, (New York, 2005), p227, ISBN 1-929631-31-6&lt;/ref&gt; This conference never materialized and without British or French support, the Russians and their client state, Serbia, were compelled to accept the Austrian-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia Herzegovina in March 1909.

Political tensions culminated on 28 June 1914, when a Bosnian Serb nationalist youth named [[Gavrilo Princip]], a member of the secret Serbian-supported movement, [[Young Bosnia]], [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinated]] the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], in Sarajevo—an event that proved to be the spark that set off World War I.

===Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1918–1941)===
{{main|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1918–1941)}}
Following World War I, Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the South Slav [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (soon renamed Yugoslavia). Political life in Bosnia at this time was marked by two major trends: social and economic unrest over [[redistribution (economics)|property redistribution]], and formation of several political parties that frequently changed coalitions and alliances with parties in other Yugoslav regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riedlmayer&quot;/&gt; The dominant ideological conflict of the Yugoslav state, between Croatian regionalism and Serbian centralization, was approached differently by Bosnia's major [[ethnic group]]s and was dependent on the overall political atmosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt; The political reforms brought about in the newly established Yugoslavian kingdom saw few benefits for the Bosniaks; according to the 1910 final census of land ownership and population according to religious affiliation conducted in Austro-Hungary, Muslims (Bosniaks) owned 91.1%, Orthodox Serbians owned 6.0%, Croatian Catholics owned 2.6% and others, 0.3% of the property. Following the reforms Bosnian Muslims had a total of 1,175,305 hectares of agricultural and forest land taken away from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Danijela Nadj, dnadj@hic.hr |url=http://www.hic.hr/books/seeurope/010e-semiz.htm |title=An International Symposium &quot;Southeastern Europe 1918–1995&quot; |publisher=Hic.hr |accessdate=14 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the initial split of the country into 33 [[oblast]]s erased the presence of traditional geographic entities from the map, the efforts of Bosnian politicians such as [[Mehmed Spaho]] ensured that the six oblasts carved up from Bosnia and Herzegovina corresponded to the six sanjaks from Ottoman times and, thus, matched the country's traditional boundary as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;

The establishment of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, however, brought the redrawing of administrative regions into [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia#Subdivisions|banates]] or ''[[banovina (region)|banovinas]]'' that purposely avoided all historical and ethnic lines, removing any trace of a Bosnian entity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt; Serbo-Croat tensions over the structuring of the Yugoslav state continued, with the concept of a separate Bosnian division receiving little or no consideration.

The [[Cvetković–Maček Agreement|Cvetković-Maček Agreement]] that created the [[Banovina of Croatia|Croatian banate]] in 1939 encouraged what was essentially a [[partition of Bosnia]] between Croatia and Serbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Imamovic&quot;/&gt; However the rising threat of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany]] forced Yugoslav politicians to shift their attention. Following a period that saw attempts at [[appeasement]], the signing of the [[Tripartite Pact|Tripartite Treaty]], and a [[Yugoslav coup d'état|coup d'état]], Yugoslavia was finally invaded by Germany on 6 April 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;

Starting in 1941, Yugoslav communists under the leadership of [[Josip Broz Tito]] organized their own multi-ethnic resistance group, the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|partisans]], who fought against both Axis and Chetnik forces. On 29 November 1943 the [[Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia]] with Tito at its helm held a founding conference in [[Jajce]] where Bosnia and Herzegovina was reestablished as a republic within the Yugoslavian federation in its Habsburg borders.

Military success eventually prompted the Allies to support the Partisans, but Tito declined their offer to help and relied on his own forces instead. All the major military offensives by the antifascist movement of Yugoslavia against Nazis and their local supporters were conducted in Bosnia-Herzegovina and its peoples bore the brunt of fighting. More than 300,000 people died in Bosnia and Herzegovina in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Žerjavić|first=Vladimir|title=Yugoslavia manipulations with the number Second World War victims|publisher=Croatian Information Centre|isbn=0-919817-32-7|url=http://www.hic.hr/books/manipulations/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the war the establishment of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], with the [[1946 Yugoslav Constitution|constitution of 1946]], officially made Bosnia and Herzegovina one of six constituent republics in the new state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;

Due to its central geographic position within the Yugoslavian federation, post-war Bosnia was selected as a base for the development of the [[Defense (military)|military defense]] industry. This contributed to a large concentration of arms and military personnel in Bosnia; a significant factor in [[Bosnian War|the war that followed the break-up of Yugoslavia]] in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt; However, Bosnia's existence within Yugoslavia, for the large part, was a peaceful and very prosperous country, with high employment, a strong industrial and export oriented economy, good education system and social and medical security for every citizen of S. R. Bosnia and Herzegovina. Cooperation with World Brand names like Volkswagen, car factory Sarajevo, from 1972, [[Coca Cola]] from 1975, SKF Sweden from 1967, Marlboro, (U.S.) with a Tobacco factory in Sarajevo, [[Holiday Inn]] hotels, and after all, organisation of [[Olympic Winter Games]] [[1984 Winter Olympics|1984 in Sarajevo]]. Though considered a political backwater of the federation for much of the 1950s and 1960s, in the 1970s a strong Bosnian political elite arose, fueled in part by Tito's regime in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and Bosnians serving in Yugoslavia's [[diplomatic corps]].

While working within the Socialist system, politicians such as [[Džemal Bijedić]], [[Branko Mikulić]] and [[Hamdija Pozderac]] reinforced and protected the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;ref name=&quot;Stojic&quot;&gt;Stojic, Mile (2005). [http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=3058&amp;reportid=170 Branko Mikulic – socialist emperor manqué]. [[BH Dani]]&lt;/ref&gt; Their efforts proved key during the turbulent period following Tito's death in 1980, and are today considered some of the early steps towards Bosnian independence. However, the republic did not escape the increasingly nationalistic climate of the time. With the fall of the Soviet Union and the start of the break-up of Yugoslavia, doctrine of tolerance began to lose its potency, creating an opportunity for nationalist elements in the society to spread their influence.

On 18 November 1990, the first multi-party parliamentary elections were held. A second round followed on 25 November, resulting in a [[National Assembly|national assembly]] where communist power was replaced by a [[coalition]] of three ethnically based parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;phron1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phron.org/Reference/Books/Balkans%20-%20post%20communist%20history.pdf |title=The Balkans: A post-Communist History |format=PDF |accessdate=14 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]]'s subsequent declarations of independence and the warfare that ensued placed Bosnia and Herzegovina and its three constituent peoples in an awkward position. A significant split soon developed on the issue of whether to stay with the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav federation]] (overwhelmingly favored among Serbs) or seek independence (overwhelmingly favored among Bosniaks and Croats).

The [[Serbs|Serb]] members of parliament, consisting mainly of the [[Serbian Democratic Party (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Serb Democratic Party]] members, abandoned the central parliament in Sarajevo, and formed the [[National Assembly of the Republika Srpska|Assembly of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on 24 October 1991, which marked the end of the tri-ethnic coalition that governed after the elections in 1990. This Assembly established the [[Republika Srpska|Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on 9 January 1992, which became [[Republika Srpska]] in August 1992.

On 18 November 1991, the party branch in Bosnia and Herzegovina of the ruling party in the Republic of Croatia, the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ), proclaimed the existence of the [[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia|Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia]], as a separate &quot;political, cultural, economic, and territorial whole&quot;, on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with [[Croatian Defence Council|Croat Defence Council]] (HVO) as its military part.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICTY: Prlić et al.

The [[Constitutional court|Constitutional Court]] of Bosnia and Herzegovina declared Herzeg-Bosnia illegal, first on 14 September 1992 and again on 20 January 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://secnet069.un.org/x/cases/prlic/ind/en/prl-ii040304e.htm|title=Prlic et al.

A declaration of the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 15 October 1991 was followed by a referendum for independence from [[Yugoslavia]] on 29 February and 1 March 1992 which was boycotted by the great majority of the Serbs. The turnout in the independence referendum was 63.4 percent and 99.7 percent of voters voted for independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://csce.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=UserGroups.Home&amp;ContentRecord_id=250&amp;ContentType=G&amp;ContentRecordType=G&amp;UserGroup_id=5&amp;Subaction=ByDate |title=The Referendum on Independence in Bosnia-Herzegovina: February 29 – March 1, 1992 |year=1992 |publisher=Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe |page=19 |accessdate=2009-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence on 3 March 1992 and received international recognition the following month on April 6, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Contested lands: Israel-Palestine, Kashmir, Bosnia, Cyprus, and Sri Lanka|first=Sumantra|last=Bose|page=124|url=http://books.google.se/books?id=KKZcgOJPjVkC&amp;pg=PA124|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2009|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was subsequently admitted as a member State of the United Nations on 22 May 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Admission to the United Nations: Charter Article 4 and the Rise of Universal Organization|first=Thomas|last=D.

In the meantime, following a period of escalating tensions, the opening shots in the incipient Bosnian conflict were fired when Serb paramilitary forces attacked Bosnian Croat villages around Capljina on 7 March 1992 and Bosanski Brod and the Bosniak-majority town, Gorazde, on 15 March. These minor attacks were followed by much more serious Serb artillery attacks on Neum on 19 March and on Bosanski Brod on 24 March. It is disputed between Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs who the first casualties of the war were. Bosniaks regard the attack on the peace rally that was organized in Sarajevo on 5 April 1992 as marking the start of warfare between the three major communities. As the largest section of demonstrators moved towards the parliament building, Serb forces opened fire on the crowd from across the &quot;Holiday Inn&quot; hotel, killing two women, [[Suada Dilberović]], a Bosniak, and [[Olga Sučić]], a Croat.&lt;ref name=&quot;phron1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Debating the End of Yugoslavia|editor=Florian Bieber|year=2014|page=52|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eyzjBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT52|publisher=Ashgate Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=ACvJHam2_-oC&amp;pg=PA284 | title = Sarajevo: A biography | isbn = 978-0-472-11557-0 | author1 = Donia | first1 = Robert J | date = 2006 | ref = harv| page = 284; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Samuel Totten|author2=Paul Robert Bartrop|title=Dictionary of genocide: A-L|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-34642-2|pages=189–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vrbanja bridge]] where they perished has since then been renamed in their honour.

Discussions between [[Franjo Tuđman]] and [[Slobodan Milošević]] at the March 1991 [[Karađorđevo meeting]] are believed to have involved a plan to [[partition of Bosnia and Herzegovina|divide Bosnia and Herzegovina between Serbia and Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina P.|title=The Three Yugoslavias: State-Building and Legitimation, 1918–2004|year=2006|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-271-01629-9|page=379}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the declaration of independence of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Serbs attacked different parts of the country. The state administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina effectively ceased to function having lost control over the entire territory. The Serbs wanted control of large parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Milošević was widely accused of being the mastermind of a plan to build a &quot;[[Greater Serbia]]&quot;, the [[RAM Plan]]. At the same time, the policies of the Republic of Croatia and its leader Franjo Tuđman towards Bosnia and Herzegovina were never totally transparent and always included Franjo Tuđman's ultimate aim of expanding Croatia's borders. Bosnian Muslims were an easy target, because the Bosnian government forces were poorly equipped and unprepared for the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICTY: Naletilić and Martinović verdict - A. Historical background&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/icty/naletilic/trialc/judgement/nal-tj030331-1.htm#IIA|title=ICTY: Naletilić and Martinović verdict – A. Historical background}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina increased diplomatic pressure for the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) to withdraw from the republic's territory which they officially did. However, in fact, the Bosnian Serb members of JNA simply changed insignia, formed the Army of Republika Srpska, and continued fighting. Armed and equipped from JNA stockpiles in Bosnia, supported by volunteers and various [[paramilitary|paramilitary forces]] from Serbia, and receiving extensive humanitarian, logistical and financial support from the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], Republika Srpska's offensives in 1992 managed to place much of the country under its control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;

Initially, the Serb forces attacked the non-Serb civilian population in Eastern Bosnia. Once towns and villages were securely in their hands, the Serb forces—military, police, the paramilitaries and, sometimes, even Serb villagers—applied the same pattern: Bosniak houses and apartments were systematically ransacked or burnt down, Bosniak civilians were rounded up or captured, and sometimes beaten or killed in the process. 2.2&amp;nbsp;million refugees were displaced by the end of the war (of all three nationalities).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unhcr.org/research/RESEARCH/3ae6a0c58.pdf|title=The humanitarian operation in Bosnia, 1992–95: the dilemmas of negotiating humanitarian access |date=May 1999 |publisher=United Nations High Commission for Refugees |accessdate=2008-06-24 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Able-bodied men were separated from their families and interned in camps under a brutal regimen of abuse, murder, and sporadic group executions, whereas women and children were kept in unsanitary detention centers, deprived of food and water. Rape by Serb soldiers or policemen was commonplace at the detention centers, and victims included women and minors as young as 12 years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICTY: Kunarac, Kovač and Vuković judgement - Foča&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un.org/icty/kunarac/trialc2/judgement/kun-tj010222e-5.htm#VC |title=ICTY: The attack against the civilian population and related requirements}}{{Dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though on a significantly smaller scale, war crimes would later also be committed by Bosniaks and Croats as their military campaigns gained momentum, including the establishment of prison camps in which torture, murder and rape took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/icty/celebici/trialc2/judgement/index.htm |title=Judgement |publisher=UN |date=5 March 2007 |accessdate=2013-01-13}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/p561-e.htm |title=Press Release |publisher=UN |date=5 March 2007 |accessdate=2013-01-07}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;haverford&quot; &gt;[http://www.haverford.edu/relg/sells/stolac/CrimesSt.pdf]{{dead link|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;un&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/prl-ii040304e.htm |title=Indictment |publisher=UN |date=5 March 2007 |accessdate=2013-01-07}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1992, the focus switched to [[Novi Travnik]] and [[Gornji Vakuf-Uskoplje|Gornji Vakuf]] where the Croat Defence Council (HVO) efforts to gain control were resisted. On 18 June 1992 the Bosnian Territorial Defence in Novi Travnik received an [[ultimatum]] from the HVO which included demands to abolish existing Bosnia and Herzegovina institutions, establish the authority of the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia and pledge allegiance to it, subordinate the Territorial Defense to the HVO and expel Muslim refugees, all within 24 hours. The attack was launched on 19 June. The elementary school and the [[Post office|Post Office]] were attacked and damaged.&lt;ref&gt;ICTY – Kordic and Cerkez judgment – II.

Gornji Vakuf was initially attacked by Croats on 20 June 1992, but the attack failed. The [[Graz agreement]] caused deep division inside the Croat community and strengthened the separation group, which led to the conflict with Bosniaks. One of the primary pro-union Croat leaders, [[Blaž Kraljević]] (leader of the [[Croatian Defence Forces]] (HOS) armed group) was killed by HVO soldiers in August 1992, which severely weakened the moderate group who hoped to keep the Bosnian Croat alliance alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Sarajevo, i poslije'', Erich Rathfelder, [[Munich|München]] 1998 [http://www.hsp1861.hr/vijesti/201129erra.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation became more serious in October 1992 when Croat forces attacked the Bosniak population in [[Prozor-Rama|Prozor]]. According to ''[[Jadranko Prlić]] indictment'', HVO forces cleansed most of the Muslims from the town of Prozor and several surrounding villages.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICTY: Prlić et al. (IT-04-74)&quot;/&gt;

By 1993 when an armed conflict erupted between the predominantly Bosniak government in Sarajevo and the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia, about 70% of the country was controlled by Republika Srpska. [[Ethnic cleansing]] and [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] violations against non-Serbs were rampant in these areas. DNA teams have been used to collect evidence of the atrocities committed by Serbian forces during these campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Court wants exemplary Karadzic trial&quot;, [[BBC News]], 2008-07-24, retrieve 2009-07-12 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7522908.stm]&lt;/ref&gt; The single most prominent example was the [[Srebrenica massacre]], ruled a [[genocide]] by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]].

[[File:Bk-map.png|thumb|200px|left|Bosnia and Herzegovina after the [[Dayton Agreement]].]]
In March 1994, the signing of the Washington Accords between the leaders of the republican government and Herzeg-Bosnia led to the creation of a joint Bosniak-Croat [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which absorbed the territory of the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia and that held by the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The Federation soon liberated the small [[Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia]].

Following the [[Srebrenica genocide]], a [[1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina|NATO bombing campaign]] began in August 1995 against the Army of Republika Srpska. Meanwhile, a ground offensive by the allied forces of Croatia and Bosnia, based on the [[Split Agreement]] signed by Tudjman and Izetbegović, pushed the Serbs away from territories held in western Bosnia which paved the way to negotiations. In December 1995, the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]], by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina ([[Alija Izetbegović]]), Croatia ([[Franjo Tuđman]]) and Serbia ([[Slobodan Milošević]]) brought a halt to the fighting, roughly establishing the basic structure of the present-day state. A [[IFOR|NATO-led peacekeeping force]] was immediately dispatched to Bosnia to enforce the agreement.

The number of identified victims is currently at 97,207 (civilian and military casualties). These include 64,341 Bosniaks, 24,726 Serbs, and 7,602 Croats.&lt;ref name=&quot;idc.org.ba&quot;&gt;[http://www.idc.org.ba/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=section&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=126&amp;lang=bs Research and Documentation Center: Rezultati istraživanja &quot;Ljudski gubici '91–'95&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research estimates the total number to be no more than 110,000 killed (civilians and military),&lt;ref name=&quot;hundred thousand&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/eujp/2005/00000021/F0020002/00006852 |publisher=European Journal of Population |title=War-related Deaths in the 1992–1995 Armed Conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina: A Critique of Previous Estimates and Recent Results |date=June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hundredthousand&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://today.reuters.com/News/CrisesArticle.aspx?storyId=L23677389 |agency=Reuters |title=Research halves Bosnia war death toll to 100,000 |date=23 November 2005}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hundredthousandplus&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2006/March/20060302182114MVyelwarC0.6359674.html |publisher=U.S. Department of State |title=Review of European Security Issues |date=3 March 2006}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1.8&amp;nbsp;million displaced.

At the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ), the Bosnian government charged Serbia of complicity in [[genocide]] in Bosnia during the war. The ICJ ruling of 26 February 2007 effectively determined the war's nature to be international, though exonerating Serbia of direct responsibility for the genocide committed by Serb forces of [[Republika Srpska]]. The ICJ concluded, however, that Serbia failed to prevent genocide committed by Serb forces and failed to punish those who carried out the genocide{{aside|in particular, General [[Ratko Mladić]]}}and bring them to justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/91/13685.pdf|title=ICJ: The genocide case: Bosnia v.

On 4 February 2014, the anti-government protests dubbed the '''Bosnian Spring''', name taken from the [[Arab Spring]], began in the northern town of [[Tuzla]]. Workers from several factories which were privatised and which have now gone bankrupt united to demand action over jobs, unpaid salaries and pensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26093160|title=Bosnian protests: A Balkan Spring?|date=8 February 2014|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=8 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon protests spread to the rest of the country with violent clashes reported in close to 20 towns, biggest of which were in [[Sarajevo]], [[Zenica]], [[Mostar]], [[Bihać]], [[Brčko]] and [[Tuzla]].

{{main|Geography of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
{{see also|List of mountains in Bosnia and Herzegovina|List of lakes in Bosnia and Herzegovina|List of rivers of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
Bosnia is located in the western [[Balkans]], bordering [[Croatia]] ({{convert|932|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}}) to the north and south-west, [[Serbia]] ({{convert|302|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}}) to the east, and [[Montenegro]] ({{convert|225|km|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}}) to the southeast. It lies between latitudes [[42nd parallel north|42°]] and [[46th parallel north|46° N]], and longitudes [[15th meridian east|15°]] and [[20th meridian east|20° E]].

The country's name comes from the two regions [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]], which have a very vaguely defined border between them. Bosnia occupies the northern areas which are roughly four-fifths of the entire country, while Herzegovina occupies the rest in the southern part of the country.

The country is mostly mountainous, encompassing the central [[Dinaric Alps]]. The northeastern parts reach into the [[Pannonian Plain|Pannonian basin]], while in the south it borders the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]]. The Dinaric Alps generally run in an east-west direction, and get higher towards the south. The highest point of the country is peak [[Maglić (mountain)|Maglić]] at 2,386&amp;nbsp;m, at the Montenegrin border. Major mountains include [[Kozara]], [[Grmeč]], [[Vlašić (mountain)|Vlašić]], [[Čvrsnica Mountain|Čvrsnica]], [[Prenj]], [[Romanija]], [[Jahorina]], [[Bjelašnica Mountain|Bjelašnica]] and [[Treskavica]].

Overall, close to 50% of Bosnia and Herzegovina is forested. Most forest areas are in Central, Eastern and Western parts of Bosnia. Herzegovina has drier Mediterranean climate, with dominant [[karst]] topography. Northern Bosnia ([[Posavina]]) contains very fertile agricultural land along the river Sava and the corresponding area is heavily farmed. This farmland is a part of the Parapannonian Plain stretching into neighboring Croatia and Serbia. The country has only {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=off}} of coastline,&lt;ref name=&quot;coastline&quot;/&gt; around the town of [[Neum]] in the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton. Although the city is surrounded by Croatian peninsulas, by the international law, Bosnia and Herzegovina has a [[right of passage]] to the outer sea.

The major cities are [[Sarajevo]], [[Banja Luka]] in the northwest region known as [[Bosanska Krajina]], [[Bijeljina]] and [[Tuzla]] in the northeast, [[Zenica]] and [[Doboj]] in the central part of Bosnia and [[Mostar]], the largest city in [[Herzegovina]].

There are seven major rivers in Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;ref name=fao&gt;{{cite web |title=Watershed Management in Mountain Regions in Bosnia and Herzegovina |url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/a0269e/A0269E05.pdf |publisher=FAO |page=113 |author=Izet Čengić, Azra Čabaravdić |accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Sava River|Sava]] is the largest river of the country, but it only forms its northern [[natural border]] with Croatia. It drains 76%&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; of the country's territory into the Danube and the Black Sea. Bosnia and Herzegovina is therefore also a member of the [[International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River]] (ICPDR).
* The [[Una (Sava)|Una]], [[Sana River|Sana]] and [[Vrbas River|Vrbas]] are right tributaries of Sava river. They are located in the northwestern region of Bosanska Krajina.
* The [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]] river gave its name to the country, and is the longest river fully contained within it. It stretches through central Bosnia, from its source near [[Sarajevo]] to Sava in the north.
* The [[Drina]] flows through the eastern part of Bosnia, and for the most part it forms a natural border with Serbia.
* The [[Neretva]] is the major river of Herzegovina and the only major river that flows south, into the Adriatic Sea.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs to the [[Boreal Kingdom]] and is shared between the Illyrian province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] and Adriatic province of the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean Region]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina can be subdivided into three [[ecoregion]]s: the Pannonian [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed forests]], Dinaric Mountains mixed forests and Illyrian [[deciduous|deciduous forests]].

The hills are located near the town of [[Visoko, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Visoko]], northwest of [[Sarajevo]]. [[Visočica hill]], where the [[Old town of Visoki]] was once sited, became the focus of international attention in October 2005, following a news-media campaign by Osmanagić and his supporters.

{{main|Politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
Bosnia and Herzegovina has several levels of political structuring, according to the [[Dayton accord]]. The most important of these levels is the division of the country into two entities: [[Republika Srpska]] and the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina covers 51% of Bosnia and Herzegovina's total area, while Republika Srpska covers 49%. The entities, based largely on the territories held by the two warring sides at the time, were formally established by the Dayton peace agreement in 1995 because of the tremendous changes in Bosnia and Herzegovina's ethnic structure. Since 1996 the power of the entities relative to the State government has decreased significantly. Nonetheless, entities still have numerous powers to themselves. The [[Brčko District]] in the north of the country was created in 2000 out of land from both entities. It officially belongs to both, but is governed by neither, and functions under a decentralized system of local government. For election purposes, Brčko District voters can choose to participate in either the Federation or Republika Srpska elections. The Brčko District has been praised for maintaining a multiethnic population and a level of prosperity significantly above the national average.&lt;ref name=&quot;OHR&quot;&gt;OHR Bulletin 66 (3 February 1998). [http://www.ohr.int/ohr-dept/presso/chronology/bulletins/default.asp?content_id=4991#8 – Final hearing of the Arbitration Tribunal in Vienna]. OHR.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third level of Bosnia and Herzegovina's political subdivision is manifested in [[Cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|cantons]]. They are unique to the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina entity, which consists of ten of them. All of them have their own cantonal government, which is under the law of the Federation as a whole. Some cantons are ethnically mixed and have special laws implemented to ensure the equality of all constituent people.

The fourth level of political division in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the municipalities. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is divided in 74 municipalities, and Republika Srpska in 63. Municipalities also have their own local government, and are typically based on the most significant city or place in their territory. As such, many municipalities have a long tradition and history with their present boundaries. Some others, however, were only created following the recent war after traditional municipalities were split by the [[Inter-Entity Boundary Line]]. Each canton in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of several municipalities, which are divided into local communities.

Besides entities, cantons, and municipalities, Bosnia and Herzegovina also has four &quot;official&quot; cities. These are: [[Banja Luka]], [[Mostar]], [[Sarajevo]], and [[Istočno Sarajevo|East Sarajevo]]. The territory and government of the cities of Banja Luka and Mostar corresponds to the municipalities of the same name, while the cities of Sarajevo and East Sarajevo officially consist of several municipalities. Cities have their own city government whose power is in between that of the municipalities and cantons (or the entity, in the case of Republika Srpska).

As a result of the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Accords]], the civilian peace implementation is supervised by the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]] selected by the [[Peace Implementation Council]]. The High Representative has many governmental and legislative powers, including the dismissal of elected and non-elected officials. More recently, several central institutions have been established (such as [[defence minister|defense ministry]], security ministry, state court, [[indirect tax]]ation service and so on) in the process of transferring part of the jurisdiction from the entities to the state.

The representation of the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina is by elites who represent the country's three major groups, with each having a guaranteed share of power.

The Chair of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] rotates among three members ([[Bosniaks|Bosniak]], [[Serbs|Serb]], [[Croats|Croat]]), each elected as the Chair for an eight-month term within their four-year term as a member. The three members of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Presidency]] are elected directly by the people with Federation voters voting for the Bosniak and the Croat, and the [[Republika Srpska]] voters for the Serb.

The Chair of the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Council of Ministers]] is nominated by the Presidency and approved by the House of Representatives. He or she is then responsible for appointing a Foreign Minister, Minister of Foreign Trade, and others as appropriate.

The [[Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Parliamentary Assembly]] is the lawmaking body in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It consists of two houses: the [[House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina|House of Peoples]] and the [[House of Representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina|House of Representatives]]. The House of Peoples has 15 delegates chosen by parliaments of the entities, two-thirds of which come from the Federation (5 Croat and 5 Bosniaks) and one-third from the Republika Srpska (5 Serbs). The House of Representatives is composed of 42 Members elected by the people under a form of [[proportional representation]] (PR), two-thirds elected from the Federation and one-third elected from the Republika Srpska.

The Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the supreme, final arbiter of legal matters. It is composed of nine members: four members are selected by the House of Representatives of the Federation, two by the Assembly of the Republika Srpska, and three by the President of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] after consultation with the Presidency, but cannot be Bosnian citizens.

However, the highest political authority in the country is the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the chief [[executive officer]] for the international civilian presence in the country. Since 1995, the High Representative has been able to bypass the elected parliamentary assembly, and since 1997 has been able to remove elected officials. The methods selected by the High Representative have been criticized as undemocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol7num2/special/bosnia.html|title='The Contradictions of &quot;Democracy&quot; without Consent', East European Constitutional Review, New York University Law School, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; International supervision is to end when the country is deemed politically and democratically stable and self-sustaining.

=== Military ===

[[File:T-55 ARBIH.JPEG|thumbnail|right|T-55 tanks belonging to the 28th Division, 281st Brigade, 1st Tank Battalion, stationed in Visca.]]
The [[Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] were unified into a single entity in 2005, with the merger of the [[Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Army of Republika Srpska]], which had defended their respective regions. The [[Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ministry of Defense]] had been founded in 2004.
The Bosnian military consists of the [[Bosnian Ground Forces]] and [[Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Air Force and Air Defense]]. The Ground Forces number 16,500 active and 5,000 reserve personnel. They are armed with a mix of American, Yugoslavian, Soviet, and European-made weaponry, vehicles, and military equipment. The Air Force and Air Defense Forces has 3,000 personnel and about 62 aircraft. The Air Defense Forces operate [[MANPAD]] hand-held missiles, [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM) batteries, anti-aircraft cannons, and radar. Almost all of its anti-aircraft equipment is of Soviet origin, though it also operates some U.S. and Swedish hardware.

The [[Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] cooperated on their first ever mission to enlist the military to [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]] peace missions to [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]] and [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] in 2007. From 5 officers, consuming the rank as officers/advisors [[Democratic Republic of Congo|DROC]]. 45 soldiers, consuming the rank as base cooperatives, protecting areas and assisting needed medical help, but commonly security [[Afghanistan|AFG]]. 85 soldiers, possessing the ranks as guard of national bases and rare patrols around near areas of the sector [[Iraq|IRQ]]. 
All three deployed groups were pronounced the highest motivation and awards, as well as the [[Ministry of Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. This procedure is still on-going.

=== Foreign relations ===
{{main|Foreign relations of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
{{see also|Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union}}
[[Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union|EU integration]] is one of the main political objectives of Bosnia and Herzegovina; it initiated the [[Stabilisation and Association Process]] in 2007. Countries participating in the SAP have been offered the possibility to become, once they fulfill the necessary conditions, Member States of the EU. Bosnia and Herzegovina is therefore a potential candidate country for EU accession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/potential-candidate-countries/bosnia_and_herzegovina/eu_bosnia_and_herzegovina_relations_en.htm |title=European Commission – Enlargement – Bosnia and Herzegovina – Relations with the EU |work=Europa (web portal) |accessdate=2009-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Accords]] of 1995 has focused the efforts of policymakers in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the international community, on regional stabilization in the countries-successors of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]]. Within Bosnia and Herzegovina, relations with its neighbors of [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] have been fairly stable since the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]] in 1995.

On 23 April 2010, Bosnia and Herzegovina received the [[Membership Action Plan]] from [[NATO]], which is the last step before full membership in the alliance. Full membership is expected in 2014 or 2015, depending on the progress of reforms.

They are also a member of the [[Group of 77]].

Bosnia and Herzegovina is home to three ethnic &quot;[[Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina|constituent peoples]]&quot;: Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats.
According to the [[1991 population census in Bosnia and Herzegovina|1991 census]], Bosnia and Herzegovina had a population of 4,377,000, while the 1996 UNHCR unofficial census showed a decrease to 3,920,000.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Large population migrations during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s have caused demographic shifts in the country. Between 1991 and 2013, political disagreements made it impossible to organize a census. A census has been planned for 2012.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Senka Kurt |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/bosnia-edges-closer-to-census |title=Bosnia Edges Closer To Population Census |publisher=Balkan Insight |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that date has been delayed until [[2013 population census in Bosnia and Herzegovina|2013]]; this was delayed until October 2013. The [[2013 population census in Bosnia and Herzegovina|2013 census]] found a total population of 3,791,622 people in 1.16 million households; this is 585,411 fewer people than the 1991 census.&lt;ref&gt;abc, [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-11-06/census-shows-dramatic-decline-in-bosnian-population-since-1990s/5072072 Census shows dramatic decline in Bosnian population since 1990s]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnically, according to data from 2000 cited by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], Bosniaks constitute 48% of the population, Serbs 37.1%, Croats 14.3%, and others form 0.6%.&lt;ref name='CIA'&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bk.html|title=CIA – The World Factbook – Bosnia and Herzegovina}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to unofficial estimates from the Bosnian State Statistics Agency cited by the US Department of State in 2008, 45 percent of the population identify religiously as Muslim, 36 percent as Serb Orthodox, 15 percent as Roman Catholic, 1 percent as Protestant, and 3 percent other (mostly atheists, [[History of the Jews in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Jews]], and others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2008/108438.htm|title=International Religious Freedom Report 2008 – Bosnia and Herzegovina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian are official languages, but all three are mutually intelligible. 54% of [[Muslim]]s are [[non-denominational Muslim]]s.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chapter 1: Religious Affiliation&quot;.

{{main|Economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
{{see also|List of companies of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}

Bosnia faces the dual-problem of rebuilding a war-torn country and introducing transitional liberal market reforms to its formerly mixed economy. One legacy of the previous era is a strong industry; under former republic president [[Džemal Bijedić]] and SFRY President [[Josip Broz Tito]], metal industries were promoted in the republic, resulting in the development of a large share of Yugoslavia's plants; S.R. Bosnia and Herzegovina had a very strong industrial export oriented economy in the 1970s and 1980s, with large scale exports worth millions of [[US$]].

For most of Bosnia's history, agriculture has been conducted on privately owned farms; Fresh food has traditionally been exported from the republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scc.rutgers.edu/serbian_digest/225/t225-4.htm |title=A Divided Bosnia, January 29, 1996 |author=Aleksandar Ciric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war in the 1990s caused a dramatic change in the Bosnian economy.&lt;ref&gt;Daclon, Corrado Maria (1997). Bosnia. Maggioli. Italy&lt;/ref&gt; GDP fell by 75% and the destruction of physical infrastructure devastated the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/employment/skills/training/publ/pub12.htm |title=Post-conflict Bosnia and Herzegovina – Martha Walsh – Employment Sector |publisher=ILO |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; With much of the production capacity unrestored, the Bosnian economy still faces considerable difficulties. Figures show GDP and per capita income increased 10% from 2003 to 2004; this and Bosnia's shrinking [[Government debt|national debt]] being negative trends,and high unemployment 44.6% and a large [[Balance of trade|trade deficit]] remain cause for concern.

===Architecture===
[[File:Vijecnica.png|thumb|right|220px|[[National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina]].]]
{{main|Architecture of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
The architecture of Bosnia and Herzegovina is largely influenced by four major periods where political and social changes influenced the creation of distinct cultural and architectural habits of the population. Each period made its influence felt and contributed to a greater diversity of cultures and architectural language in this region.

===Literature===
[[File:Andric Ivo.jpg|thumb|left|170px|[[Travnik]]-born writer [[Ivo Andrić]] won the 1961 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] for his novel ''[[The Bridge on the Drina]]''.]]
{{main|Literature of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
Bosnia and Herzegovina has a rich literature, including the [[Nobel prize]] winner [[Ivo Andrić]] and poets such as Croat [[Antun Branko Šimić]], [[Aleksa Šantić]], [[Jovan Dučić]] and [[Mak Dizdar]], writers such as [[Meša Selimović]], [[Semezdin Mehmedinović]], [[Miljenko Jergović]], [[Isak Samokovlija]], [[Safvet beg Bašagić]], [[Abdulah Sidran]], [[Petar Kočić]], [[Aleksandar Hemon]], and Nedžad Ibrišimović. The National Theater was founded 1919 in Sarajevo and its first director was the dramatist [[Branislav Nušić]].
Magazines such as ''[[Novi Plamen]]'' or ''Sarajevske biljeznice'' are some of the more prominent publications covering cultural and literary themes.

===Art===
[[File:Bosniangraves bosniska gravar februari 2007 stecak stecci5.jpg|upright|thumb|Stećci from Radimlja, near [[Stolac]] (13th century).]]
{{main|Art of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
The art of Bosnia and Herzegovina was always evolving and ranged from the original medieval tombstones called [[Stećci]] to paintings in [[House of Kotromanić|Kotromanić]] court. However, only with the arrival of Austro-Hungarians did the painting renaissance in Bosnia really begin to flourish. The first educated artists from European academies appeared with the beginning of the 20th century. Among those are: [[Gabrijel Jurkić]], [[Petar Šain]], [[Roman Petrović]] and [[Lazar Drljača]].

After World War II artists like [[Mersad Berber]] and [[Safet Zec]] rose in popularity.

In 2007, [[Ars Aevi]], a museum of contemporary art that includes works by renowned world artists was founded in Sarajevo.

===Music===

{{main|Music of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
{{see also|List of Bosnia and Herzegovina patriotic songs}}
Typical Bosnian and Herzegovinian songs are ''ganga, rera'', and the traditional Slavic music for the folk dances such as ''[[kolo (dance)|kolo]]'' and from Ottoman era the most popular is [[sevdalinka]]. Pop and Rock music has a tradition here as well, with the more famous musicians including [[Dino Zonić]], [[Goran Bregović]], [[Davorin Popović]], [[Kemal Monteno]], [[Zdravko Čolić]], [[Elvir Laković]], [[Edo Maajka]], [[Hari Mata Hari]] and [[Dino Merlin]]. Other composers such as [[Đorđe Novković]], [[Al' Dino]], [[Haris Džinović]], [[Kornelije Kovač]], and many pop and [[Rock bands|rock band]]s, for example, [[Bijelo dugme|Bijelo Dugme]], [[Crvena Jabuka]], [[Divlje Jagode]], [[Indexi]], [[Plavi orkestar|Plavi Orkestar]], [[Zabranjeno Pušenje]], [[Ambasadori]], [[Dubioza kolektiv]], who were among the leading ones in the former Yugoslavia. Bosnia is home to the composer [[Dušan Šestić]], the creator of the current [[national anthem]] of Bosnia and Herzegovina and father of singer [[Marija Šestić]], composer [[Saša Lošić]] and pianist [[Saša Toperić]]. In the villages, especially in Herzegovina, Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats play the ancient ''[[Gusle]]''. The gusle is used mainly to recite epic poems in a usually dramatic tone.

Probably the most distinctive and identifiably &quot;Bosnian&quot; of music, Sevdalinka is a kind of emotional, melancholic folk song that often describes sad subjects such as love and loss, the death of a dear person or heartbreak. Sevdalinkas were traditionally performed with a [[saz (musical instrument)|saz]], a Turkish string instrument, which was later replaced by the accordion. However the more modern arrangement, to the derision of some purists, is typically a vocalist accompanied by the accordion along with snare drums, upright bass, guitars, clarinets and violins.

{{main|Bosnia and Herzegovina cuisine}}
Bosnian cuisine uses many spices, in moderate quantities. Most dishes are light, as they are cooked in lots of water; the sauces are fully natural, consisting of little more than the natural juices of the vegetables in the dish. Typical ingredients include tomatoes, potatoes, onions, [[garlic]], [[capsicum|peppers]], [[cucumber]]s, carrots, [[cabbage]], [[mushroom]]s, [[spinach]], [[zucchini]], [[bean|dried beans]], fresh beans, [[plum]]s, milk, [[paprika]] and cream called [[Smetana (dairy product)|Pavlaka]]. Bosnian cuisine is balanced between [[Western culture|Western]] and [[Eastern world|Eastern]] influences. As a result of the [[Turkish cuisine|Ottoman]] administration for almost 500 years, Bosnian food is closely related to [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], and other former [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean]] cuisines. However, because of years of Austrian rule, there are many influences from Central Europe. Typical meat dishes include primarily beef and [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]. Some local specialties are [[Ćevapčići|ćevapi]], [[burek]], [[dolma]], [[sarma (food)|sarma]], [[pilav]], [[goulash]], [[ajvar]] and a whole range of Eastern sweets. '''Ćevapi''' ({{IPA-sh|tɕɛv̞ǎːpi|pron}}) or '''ćevapčići''' (formal [[diminutive]], {{IPA-sh|tɕɛv̞ǎptʃitɕi|}}, {{lang|sr-cyrl|ћевапчићи}}) is a grilled dish of minced meat, a type of [[kebab]], found traditionally in the countries of [[southeastern Europe]] (the [[Balkans]]). They are considered a national dish in Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bosnia and Herzegovina|year=2009|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=July 27, 2009|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/700826/Bosnia-and-Herzegovina}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Serbia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=aoVUAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=cevapcici|title=The new Encyclopaedia Britannica: A-ak – Bayes, Volume 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=pssZAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=cevapcici|title=Countries and Their Cultures: Saint Kitts and Nevis to Zimbabwe|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=TravelSerbia.Info – Your travel guide for Serbia|accessdate=August 9, 2010|url=http://www.travelserbia.info/serbian-cuisine.php|title=Serbian cuisine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are also common in [[Croatia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Slovenia]], as well as in [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Austria]], [[Turkey]] and the [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia|Italian region bordering Slovenia]]. Bosnian ćevapčići from the Baščaršija district of Sarajevo are probably the most famous Ćevapi.  Local wines come from [[Herzegovina]] where the climate is suitable for growing grapes. Herzegovinian loza (similar to Italian [[Grappa]] but less sweet) is very popular. Plum (''rakija'') or apple (''jabukovača'') alcohol beverages are produced in the north. In the south, distilleries used to produce vast quantities of [[brandy]] and supply all of ex-Yugoslavian alcohol factories (brandy is the base of most [[alcoholic beverage|alcoholic drinks]]).

===Leisure activities===
Coffeehouses, where [[Turkish coffee#Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian coffee]] is served in [[cezve|džezva]] with [[Turkish Delight|rahat lokum]] and sugar cubes, proliferate [[Sarajevo]] and every city in the country. Coffee drinking is a favorite Bosnian pastime and part of the culture. Bosnia and Herzegovina is the tenth country in the entire world by per capita coffee consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldofsevdah.com/bosnian-traditional-coffee/ |title=Bosnian traditional coffee &quot; World of Sevdah |publisher=Worldofsevdah.com |date=8 March 2007 |accessdate=2010-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
