== History ==
{{Main|History of Andhra Pradesh}}

The Andhras trace their history to the vedic age. Andhra was mentioned in the [[Sanskrit epics]] such as [[Aitareya Brahmana]] (800 [[BCE]]). According to [[Aitareya Brahmana]] of the Rig veda, Andhras left the &quot;northern land of the [[Aryan]]s&quot; and migrated to South India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dance Dialects of India|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KRz5ykKRVAEC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=Andhra+Trace+their+history&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lQeUU5qXNo2XyATjh4H4Dg&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Andhra%20Trace%20their%20history&amp;f=false|work=Ragini Devi|publisher=Motilal Bansarsi Dass|ISBN=81-208-0674-3|accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Andhra Pradesh|url=http://www.aponline.gov.in/quick%20links/hist-cult/history.html|work=AP Online|publisher=[[Government of Andhra Pradesh]]|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient and medieval history of Andhra Pradesh|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wENuAAAAMAAJ|work=P.

The roots of the [[Telugu language]] have been seen on inscriptions found near the [[Guntur]] district and from others dating to the rule of Renati Cholas in the fifth century [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Age of Telugu language|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/12/20/stories/2007122054820600.htm|accessdate=31 July 2013|newspaper=[[The Hindu]]|date=20 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salomon|first=Richard|title=Indian epigraphy : a guide to the study of inscriptions in Sanskrit, Prakrit, and the other Indo-Aryan languages|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-509984-2|page=106|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early history ===

==== Satavahana empire ====
The Early [[Satavahanas]] ruled [[Coastal Andhra|Andhra]]. The puranas refer to [[Satavahanas]] as '''Andhra Bhrityas'''. The [[Puranas|Purāṇas]] list 30 Andhra rulers. Many are known from their coins and inscriptions as well. Satavahanas made [[Amaravati, Andhra Pradesh|Amaravati]] as their capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Andhras|url=http://www.katragadda.com/articles/HistoryOfTheAndhras.pdf|work=Durga Prasad|publisher=P.

'''Simuka (c.230–207 [[BCE]])'''
After becoming independent around 230 [[BCE]], [[Simuka]], the founder of the dynasty, conquered the present-day [[Maharashtra]] and parts of [[Madhya Pradesh]] (including [[Malwa]]). He was succeeded by his brother [[Kanha]] (or Krishna) (r. 207–189 [[BCE]]), who further extended his state to the present day Andhra Pradesh. Later, Simuka made [[Srikakulam]]  his capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;A Journey Through India's Past&quot;/&gt;

'''Satakarni (c.180–124 [[BCE]])'''
[[File:Satkarni1.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Early [[Satakarni]] issue, [[Maharashtra]] – [[Vidarbha]] type.]]
[[File:Satavahana1stCenturyBCECoinInscribedInBrahmi(Sataka)Nisa.jpg|thumb|200px|Satavahana 1 [[BCE]] coin inscribed in Brahmi: &quot;(Sataka)Nisa&quot;. [[British Museum]]]]

His successor [[Satakarni|Sātakarnī I]] was the sixth ruler of the Satavahana. He is said to have ruled for 56 years. The [[Maurya Empire|Mauryans]] extended their rule over Andhra in the fourth century BCE. With the fall of the Maurya Empire in the third century [[BCE]], the [[Satavahana dynasty|Satavahanas]] became independent. After the decline of the Satavahanas in 220 [[Common Era|CE]], the [[Ikshvaku dynasty]], [[Pallava]]s, [[Ananda Gotrika]]s, [[Rashtrakuta]]s, [[Vishnukundina]]s, [[Eastern Chalukyas]], and [[Chola Dynasty|Cholas]] ruled the land.&lt;ref&gt;G. Durga Prasad, History of the Andhras up to 1565 [[AD]], P.G. Publishers, Guntur, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ikshvakus ====
''Andhra Ikshvakus'' ([[Sanskrit]] इक्ष्वाकु, [[Telugu language|Telugu]] ఇక్ష్వాకులు) were one of the earliest recorded ruling dynasties of the Krishna-Guntur regions of Andhra Pradesh.They ruled the eastern Andhra country along the [[Krishna river]] during the later half of the second century [[Common Era|CE]]. [[Puranas]] called Andhra Ikshvakus '''Shri Parvatiya Andhras'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;katragadda1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Andhras|url=http://www.katragadda.com/articles/HistoryOfTheAndhras.pdf|work=Durga Prasad|publisher=P. G. PUBLISHERS|chapter=Chapter 3|accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/12/02/stories/2006120201320200.htm|title=Andhra Ikshvaku inscriptions|work=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their capital was Vijayapuri ([[Nagarjunakonda]]). It is a strong common belief among some historians that Andhra Ikshvakus were related to the mythological [[Ikshvaku Dynasty|Ikshvakus]], while some believe Andhra Ikshvakus seem to be a local tribe who adopted the title.&lt;ref name=&quot;katragadda1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ancient India, A History Textbook for Class XI, Ram Sharan Sharma, [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]], India , pp 212&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological evidence has suggested that the Andhra Ikshvakus immediately succeeded the [[Satavahanas]] in the [[Krishna river]] valley. Ikshvakus have left inscriptions at [[Nagarjunakonda]], [[Jaggayyapeta]], [[Amaravati, Andhra Pradesh|Amaravati]] and [[Bhattiprolu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;katragadda1&quot;/&gt;

==== Pallavas ====
During third century [[AD]], there was utter political and military confusion in the coastal Andhra due to the invasion of the Abhiras and their allies on the last Ikshvaku remnants and the rise of the Brihatphalayanas, the Anandagotras and the Salankayanas on the other. Simha Varma of the Manchikallu stone inscription establishes the independent rule of the Pallavas in parts of the Krishna valley of Andhra Pradesh.

During the reign of Maharaja Sivaskanda Varma of the Mayidavolu, Hirahadagalli, the early Pallavas became dominant power in the first quarter of the fourth century [[AD]] Sivaskanda Varma was the first great ruler of the early Pallavas. He extended his dominions from the [[Krishna district|Krishna]] in the north to the south [[Penner River|Pennar]] in the south and to the [[Bellary district]] in the West. He performed the [[Aswamedha]] and other Vedic sacrifices.

Most of the Pallava Prakrit and Sanskrit charters from the southern Andhra country intimately connects them with the history of southern Andhra. The influence of the Pallavas was still felt by Andhra till it was swept by the Western Chalukyan invasion led by Pulakesin II in the first quarter of the seventh century [[AD]]. The Pallavas were not a recognized political power before the 2nd century [[AD]]. Pallavas were originally executive officers under the Satavahana kings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient and medieval history of Andhra Pradesh|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wENuAAAAMAAJ|work=P. Raghunadha Rao|publisher=Sterling Publishers, 1993|page=68|accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Vishnukundins ====
Since the fall of the Ikshvakus, the Vishnukundins were the first great dynasty, which held sway way over the entire Andhra country including Kalinga and parts of Telangana and played an important and imperial role in the history of Deccan during the fifth and sixth century [[AD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient and medieval history of Andhra Pradesh and telangana|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wENuAAAAMAAJ|work=P. Raghunadha Rao|publisher=Sterling Publishers, 1993|page=70|accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Salankayanas ====
''The Salankayanas'' were an ancient dynasty that ruled the [[Coastal Andhra|Andhra]] region between Godavari and Krishna with their capital as Vengi, modern Pedavegi 12&amp;nbsp;km from Eluru in [[West Godavari district]] of Andhra Pradesh, [[India]]'s from 300 to 440 [[AD]]. They were [[Brahmins]] and their name is derived from their symbol and [[gotra]] name, which stood for [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] (the bull of [[Shiva]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Ancient Indian History and civilization By S.

====Chola Dynasty====
The [[Chola dynasty]] ruled Andhra during the period of 1010–1200. The Chola territories stretched from the islands of the Maldives in the south to as far north as the banks of the Godavari River in Andhra Pradesh.

=== Modern history ===
Inspired by their success, the [[Vijayanagara Empire]], one of the greatest empires in the history of Andhra Pradesh and India, was founded by [[Harihara]] and [[Bukka]], who served as treasury officers of the Kakatiyas of Warangal.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Sewell, ''A Forgotten Empire (Vijayanagar): A contribution to the history of India'', Chapter 2 [http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext02/fevch10.txt Gutenberg.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1347 [[Common Era|CE]], an independent Muslim state, the [[Bahmani Sultanate]], was established in [[south India]] by [[Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah]] in a revolt against the Delhi Sultanate. The [[Qutb Shahi dynasty]] held sway over the Andhra country for about two hundred years from the early part of the 16th century to the end of the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richards&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richards|first=J.

In [[Colonial India]], [[Northern Circars]] became part of the British [[Madras Presidency]]. Eventually this region emerged as the [[Coastal Andhra]] region. Later the [[Nizam]] rulers of Hyderabad ceded five territories to the British which eventually emerged as [[Rayalaseema]] region. The Nizams retained control of the interior provinces as the [[princely state]] of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]], acknowledging British rule in return for local autonomy.

In an effort to gain an independent state based on linguistic differences and to protect the interests of the Telugu-speaking people of [[Madras State]], [[Potti Sreeramulu]] fasted until death in 1952. As Madras became a bone of contention, in 1949 a JVP committee report stated &quot;Andhra Province could be formed provided the Andhras give up their claim on the city of Madras (now Chennai)&quot;.

Geographically, Andhra Pradesh is bestowed with two mighty river systems of [[Krishna River|Krishna]] and [[Godavari river|Godavari]]. Its varied topography ranging from the hills of [[Eastern Ghats]] and [[Nallamala Hills|Nallamallas]] to the shores of [[Bay of Bengal]] supports varied ecotypes, rich diversity of flora and fauna. The state has two regions [[Coastal Andhra]] and [[Rayalaseema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maharashtraweb.com/AndhraPradesh/AndhraPradeshgeography.htm |title=Andhra Pradesh Geography |publisher=Maharashtraweb.com |accessdate=15 August 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100929081617/http://maharashtraweb.com/AndhraPradesh/AndhraPradeshgeography.htm| archivedate= 29 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plains to the east of Eastern Ghats form the [[Eastern coastal plains]]. The coastal plains are for the most part of delta regions formed by the [[Godavari River|Godavari]], [[River Krishna|Krishna]], and [[Penner River|Penna]] rivers. The Eastern Ghats are discontinuous and individual sections have local names. The Eastern Ghats are a major dividing line in the state's geography. The Kadapa Basin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kadapa basin|url=http://www.dghindia.org/10.aspx|publisher=Directorate General of Hydrocarbons|accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; formed by two arching branches of the Eastern Ghats is a mineral-rich area. The Ghats become more pronounced towards the south and extreme north of the coast. Most of the coastal plains are put to intense agricultural use. The [[Rayalaseema]] region has semi-arid conditions. [[Lambasingi]] (or Lammasingi), a village in the Chintaplli Mandal of [[Vishakapatnam district]] is situated at 1000 meters above the sea level. It is the only place in South India which has snowfall and is also nicknamed as ''Kashmir of Andhra Pradesh''.

''[[Andhra Pradesh Forest Department]]'' deals with protection, conservation and management of [[forests]]. The total forest cover of the state after the bifurcation is left with an area of 22,862&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=forests&gt;{{cite web|title=Forests in AP facts.|url=http://forest.ap.nic.in/About.htm|publisher=AP Forest department|accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forest in the state can be broadly divided into four major biotic provinces.&lt;ref name=&quot;flora and fauna&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural vegetation and wildlife|url=http://forest.ap.nic.in/WLINDEX.htm|publisher=AP Forest Department|accessdate=6 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are:
#[[Deccan Plateau]]
#Central Plateau
#Eastern Highland
#East Coastal Plains

[[Eastern Ghats]] region is home to dense tropical forests, while the vegetation becomes sparse as the Ghats give way to the Deccan Plateau, where shrub vegetation is more common. These ghats has rich biological diversity with wide variety of plants, birds and lesser forms of animal life. The vegetation found in the state is largely of dry deciduous type with a mixture of ''Teak'', ''Terminalias'', ''Dalbergias'', ''Pterocarpus'', ''Anogeissus'' etc.
The State possesses some rare and endemic plants like ''[[Cycas beddomei]]'', ''[[Pterocarpus santalinus]]'', ''Terminalia pallida'', ''Syzygium alternifolium'', ''Shorea talura'', ''Shorea tumburgia'', ''[[Psilotum nudum]]'' etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;flora and fauna&quot; /&gt;

The diversity of fauna includes tigers, panthers, hyenas, black bucks, cheetals, sambars, sea turtles and a number of birds and reptiles. The estuaries of river Godavari and Krishna support rich mangrove forests with fishing cats and otters as keystone species.&lt;ref name=&quot;flora and fauna&quot; /&gt;

==Climate==
The climate of Andhra Pradesh varies considerably, depending on the geographical region. Monsoons play a major role in determining the climate of the state. Summers last from March to June. In the coastal plain, the summer temperatures are generally higher than the rest of the state, with temperature ranging between 20&amp;nbsp;°C and 41&amp;nbsp;°C.

July to September is the season for tropical rains in Andhra Pradesh. The state receives heavy rainfall from the Southwest Monsoon during these months. About one third of the total rainfall in Andhra Pradesh is brought by the [[Northeast Monsoon]]. October and November see low-pressure systems and tropical cyclones form in the Bay of Bengal which, along with the Northeast Monsoon, bring rains to the southern and coastal regions of the state. November, December, January, and February are the winter months in Andhra Pradesh. Since the state has a long coastal belt the winters are not very cold. The range of winter temperature is generally 12&amp;nbsp;°C to 30&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=&quot;tourisminap.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Aptdc, Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation|url=http://www.tourisminap.com/know_ap/index.php |title=APTDC – Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation|publisher=Tourisminap.com|date=27 May 2010 |accessdate=15 August 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100806000215/http://www.tourisminap.com/know_ap/index.php| archivedate= 6 August 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhism spread to Andra Pradesh early in its history. The Krishna River valley was &quot;a site of extraordinary Buddhist activity for almost a thousand years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Ronald. ''Tibetan Renaissance''. Columbia 2005, pp. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Buddhist sites in the lower Krishna Valley, including Amaravati, Nagarjunakonda and Jaggayyapeta &quot;can be traced to at least the third century BCE, if not earlier.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Padma, Sree. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra.'' SUNY Press 2008, pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The region played a central role in the development of [[Mahayana]]-buddhism, alongside with the [[Magadha]]-erea in northeastern India.&lt;ref&gt;Padma, Sree. Barber, Anthony W.

The state is divided into two regions viz., [[Coastal Andhra]] and [[Rayalaseema]]. Of the 13 districts of the state, nine are in [[Coastal Andhra]] and four of them are in [[Rayalaseema]]. The districts are further divided into [[mandal]]s, with a total of 661 mandals in the state.

Andhra Pradesh has a [[Vidhan Sabha]] (legislative assembly, lower house) of 175 seats, and a [[Vidhan Parishad]] (legislative council, upper house) of 54 members. In the [[Parliament of India]] Andhra Pradesh has 11 in the [[Rajya Sabha]], the Upper House, and 25 in the [[Lok Sabha]], the Lower House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apassemblylive.com|title=Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1962, the CPI, along with socialist parties namely Praja Socialist Party and Krishi Lok Party played an important role in the 1950s. In the 1967 state assembly elections, all socialist parties were eliminated and [[CPI]] lost opposition party status. The first Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh was [[Neelam Sanjiva Reddy]] who later served as President of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/andhra-pradesh/kiran-beats-pv-rosaiah-anjaiah-in-tenure/article4132949.ece|title= The Hindu, November 25, 2012|accessdate= 20 December 2013 | location=Chennai, India|date=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article3529044.ece?homepage=true|title= The Hindu, on the election and Presidency|accessdate= 20 December 2013 | location=Chennai, India|date=15 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the [[Telugu Desam Party]] (TDP) won the state elections and [[N.T. Rama Rao]] became the chief minister of the state for the first time. This broke the long time single party monopoly enjoyed by the INC from 1956 until 1982. [[Nandamuri Taraka Rama Rao]] is the founder of Telugu Desam party and served as the first chief minister from the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-telugu-desam-party-turns-29-nt-rama-rao-remembered-1364859|title= Telugu Desam turns 29.|accessdate= 20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1989 elections ended the rule of [[N. T. Rama Rao|NTR]], with the [[Indian National Congress|INC]] party returning to power with [[Marri Chenna Reddy]] at the helm. He was replaced by [[Nedurumalli Janardhana Reddy|Janardhan Reddy]] in 1990, who was replaced by [[Kotla Vijaya Bhaskara Reddy]] in 1992.

[[Nara Chandrababu Naidu|N. Chandrababu Naidu]] held the record for the longest serving chief minister (1995 to 2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/401839/Nara-Chandrababu-Naidu|title= Length of time as Chief Minister|accessdate= 20 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Andhra Pradesh gave a mandate to the [[Telugu Desam Party]] again, and [[N. T. Rama Rao|NTR]] became the chief minister again. [[Nara Chandrababu Naidu]], the son-in-law of NTR, came to power with the backing of a majority of the [[MLAs]]. The Telugu Desam Party won both the assembly and [[Lok Sabha]] election in 1999 under the leadership of [[Nara Chandrababu Naidu|Chandrababu Naidu]].

In the ensuing elections the party lost power to a resurgent [[Indian National Congress|INC]] and its allies and [[Y. S. Rajasekhar Reddy]] became the [[Chief Minister]]. [[Y. S. Rajasekhar Reddy]] became [[Chief Minister]] again by fending off the [[Praja Rajyam Party]] and a major alliance of [[Telugu Desam Party|TDP]], [[Telangana Rashtra Samithi|TRS]], [[CPI]] and [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)|CPM]]. He died on 2 September 2009 in a helicopter crash. [[Konijeti Rosaiah]], former state finance minister, became the Chief Minister on 3 September 2009, who resigned on 24 November 2010 on the grounds of increased work pressure. [[Nallari Kiran Kumar Reddy]] was sworn in as the new Chief Minister, who was also the last [[Chief Minister]] of the united Andhra Pradesh. He resigned after the announcement of the state bifurcation. [[President's rule]] was imposed and the state assembly was dissolved.

In what would be the last elections held in the unified state, [[Telugu Desam Party]] got a mandate in their favor in the residuary state. [[Nara Chandrababu Naidu]], the chief of [[Telugu Desam Party]] became [[Chief Minister]] on 8 June 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBN to be sworn as CM of Andhra on June 8th|url=http://deccan-journal.com/content/cbn-take-oath-june-8th|work=Deccan-Journal|accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
