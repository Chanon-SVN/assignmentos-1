'''Aaliyah Dana Haughton''' ({{IPAc-en|a:|ˈ|l|iː|ə}}) (January 16, 1979&amp;nbsp;– August 25, 2001) was an American singer, dancer, actress, and model. She was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York, and  raised in [[Detroit]], Michigan. At the age of 10, she appeared on the television show ''[[Star Search]]'' and performed in concert alongside [[Gladys Knight]]. At age 12, Aaliyah signed with [[Jive Records]] and her uncle [[Barry Hankerson]]'s [[Blackground Records]]. Hankerson introduced her to [[R. Kelly]], who became her mentor, as well as lead songwriter and producer of her debut album, ''[[Age Ain't Nothing but a Number]]''. The album sold three million copies in the United States and was certified double platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). After facing allegations of an illegal marriage with [[R. Kelly]], Aaliyah ended her contract with Jive and signed with [[Atlantic Records]].

Aaliyah worked with record producers [[Timbaland]] and [[Missy Elliott]] for her second album, ''[[One in a Million (Aaliyah album)|One in a Million]]''; it sold 3.7 million copies in the United States and over eight million copies worldwide. In 2000, Aaliyah appeared in her first major film, ''[[Romeo Must Die]]''. She contributed to the film's soundtrack, which spawned the single &quot;[[Try Again (Aaliyah song)|Try Again]]&quot;. The song topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] solely on [[airplay]], making Aaliyah the first artist in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' history to achieve this feat. &quot;Try Again&quot; earned Aaliyah a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for Best Female R&amp;B Vocalist. After completing ''Romeo Must Die'', Aaliyah filmed her part in ''[[Queen of the Damned (film)|Queen of the Damned]]''. She released her third and final album, ''[[Aaliyah (album)|Aaliyah]]'', in July 2001.

On August 25, 2001, Aaliyah and eight others were killed in a plane crash in [[The Bahamas]] after filming the music video for the single &quot;[[Rock the Boat (Aaliyah song)|Rock the Boat]]&quot;. The [[aviator|pilot]], Luis Morales III, was unlicensed at the time of the accident and had traces of [[cocaine]] and alcohol in his system. Aaliyah's family later filed a [[wrongful death claim|wrongful death]] lawsuit against [[Blackhawk International Airways]], which was settled out of court. Aaliyah's music has continued to achieve commercial success with several posthumous releases. Aaliyah sold 52 million records worldwide. She has been credited for helping redefine [[contemporary R&amp;B]] and [[hip hop music|hip hop]], earning her the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|nicknames]] &quot;Princess of R&amp;B&quot; and &quot;Queen of Urban Pop&quot;. She is listed by ''Billboard'' as the tenth most successful female R&amp;B artist of the past 25 years and 27th most successful R&amp;B artist in history.

For her entire life, Aaliyah tried living up to her name every day.&lt;ref name=Sutherland2 /&gt; At a young age, Aaliyah was enrolled in voice lessons by her mother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;/&gt; She started performing at weddings, church [[choir]] and charity events.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sutherland|2005|p=9|Ref=Sutherland}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she was five years old, her family moved to [[Detroit]], Michigan, where she was raised along with her older brother, [[Rashad Haughton|Rashad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kenyatta|2002|p=3|Ref=Kenyatta}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG rock&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bogdanov|first=Vladimir|author2=Woodstra, Chris; Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|title=All Music Guide to Rock|publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation]]|year=2002|page=1|isbn=0-87930-653-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] school, Gesu Elementary, where in [[first grade]], she received a part in the stage play ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]''. From then on, she was determined to become an entertainer.&lt;ref name=Farley22-23 /&gt; In Detroit, her father began working in the warehouse business, one of his brother-in-law Barry Hankerson's widening interests.

Throughout her life, she had a good relationship with her brother, which traced back to their childhood as Rashad reflected that growing up with Aaliyah was &quot;amazing&quot;. He recalled her running around their home singing and that never being annoying due to her having a &quot;beautiful voice&quot;. She and her brother became close with their cousin Jomo Hankerson, since growing up, they lived &quot;about five blocks apart&quot;. Jomo walked Aaliyah and Rashad to their home from school when their mother was not able to pick them up and recalled the Haughton household being filled with music.&lt;ref name=Farley22-23&gt;Farley 2002, pp. 22-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Aaliyah's family was very close due to the struggles of her grandparents and when the Haughtons moved to Detroit, the Hankersons were ready to take them in if necessary. These same bonds led to ties in the music industry, under the Blackground Records label.&lt;ref name=Sutherland2 /&gt;

Aaliyah's mother was a vocalist, and her uncle, [[Barry Hankerson]], was an [[entertainment law]]yer who had been married to [[Gladys Knight]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG rock&quot;/&gt; As a child, Aaliyah traveled with Knight and worked with an agent in New York to audition for commercials and television programs, including ''[[Family Matters]]''; she went on to appear on ''[[Star Search]]'' at the age of ten.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;/&gt; Aaliyah chose to begin auditioning while her mother made the decision to have her surname dropped.&lt;ref name=JenniferWarner /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sutherland|2005|p=15|Ref=none}}&lt;/ref&gt; She auditioned for several record labels and at age 11 appeared in concerts alongside Knight.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG rock&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Independent&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/aaliyah-755377.html|title=Aaliyah – Obituaries, News|last=Perrone|first=Pierre|date=August 27, 2001|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=April 4, 2009|location=London|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100606064412/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/aaliyah-755377.html|archivedate=June 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had several pet animals in during her childhood, which included ducks, snakes and iguanas. Her cousin Jomo had a pet alligator, which Aaliyah felt was too much, remarking, &quot;that was something I wasn't going to stroke.&quot;&lt;ref name=Sutherland2 /&gt;

Her grandmother died in 1991. Years after her death, Aaliyah said her grandmother supported everyone in the family and always wanted to hear her sing, as well as admitting that she &quot;spoiled&quot; her and her brother Rashad &quot;to death.&quot; She also enjoyed Aaliyah's singing and would have Aaliyah to sing for her. Aaliyah stated that she thought of her grandmother whenever she fell into depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c5NSZQguXKI/UrISESr2cSI/AAAAAAAABdM/yAzUy9B0moU/s1600/tumblr_mxyel4e9l31sck243o4_1280.jpg |title=Photograph of interview|publisher=blogspot.com |accessdate=2014-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaliyah's hands reminded her of her aunt, who died when she was &quot;very young&quot; and Aaliyah referred to her as an &quot;amazingly beautiful woman&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/humor-sweets-delights-article-1.927110|title=HUMOR &amp; SWEETS WERE HER DELIGHTS|first=Lauren|last=Rubin|date=August 28, 2001|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aaliyah attended Detroit schools growing up and believed she was well-liked, but got teased for her short stature. She recalled coming into her own prior to age 15 and grew to love her height. Her mother would tell her to be happy that she was small and compliment her. Other children disliked Aaliyah, but she did not stay focused on them. &quot;You always have to deal with people who are jealous, but there were so few it didn't even matter. The majority of kids supported me, which was wonderful. When it comes to dealing with negative people, I just let it in one ear and out the other. Those people were invisible to me.&quot; Even in her adult life, she considered herself small. She had &quot;learned to accept and love&quot; herself and added: &quot;...the most important thing is to think highly of yourself because if you don't, no one else will&quot;.&lt;ref name=Sutherland2&gt;Sutherland 2005, 2-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aaliyah, who maintained a perfect 4.0 grade point average when graduating from Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts, felt education was important. She saw fit to keep her grades up despite the pressures and time constraints brought on her during the early parts of her career. She labeled herself as a perfectionist and recalled always being a good student. Aaliyah reflected: &quot;I always wanted to maintain that, even in high school when I first started to travel. I wanted to keep that 4.0. Being in the industry, you know, I don't want kids to think, 'I can just sing and forget about school.' I think it's very important to have an education, and even more important to have something to fall back on.&quot; She did this in her own life, as she planned to &quot;fall back on&quot; another part of the entertainment industry. She believed that if she could teach music history or open her own school to teach that or drama if  she did not not make a living as a recording artist because, as she reasoned, &quot;when you pick a career it has to be something you love&quot;.&lt;ref name=Sutherland2 /&gt;

In May 2001, [[Shaquille O'Neal]] admitted that his remarks where he claimed to have engaged in sexual intercourse with Aaliyah, [[Cindy Crawford]] and [[Venus Williams]] were false after making the allegations during an appearance on a radio station and apologized to the three. All three denied the claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/gen/news/2001/0508/1193163.html|title=Shaq offers apologies for fabricated affairs|date=May 8, 2001|publisher=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, June 2001, Aaliyah posed for a photo shoot with Eric Johnson. Johnson kept the images in his &quot;private personal archive&quot; for thirteen years before providing digital copies of 13 Aaliyah photographs to an online photography magazine and authorizing the publication to use the photographs for a story they were doing on Aaliyah. Not long after, he filed a lawsuit claiming ABC had infringed his rights since the corporation authorized further reproduction by reproducing them online.&lt;ref name=EURweb /&gt;

Aaliyah released her self-titled album, ''[[Aaliyah (album)|Aaliyah]]'', in July 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;/&gt; It debuted at number two on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling 187,000 copies in its first week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/78998/keys-wards-off-aaliyah-foxy-at-no-1|title=Keys Wards Off Aaliyah, Foxy at No. 1|last=Martens|first=Todd|date=July 26, 2001|work=Billboard|accessdate=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first single from the album, &quot;[[We Need a Resolution]]&quot;, peaked at number 59 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Billboard&quot;/&gt; She finished recording the album in March 2001&lt;ref name=MTVMarch2001&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1441665/aaliyah-finishes-new-album-during-break-from-movies/|date=March 14, 2001|title=Aaliyah Finishes New Album During Break From Movies|publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; after a year of recording tracks that began in March of the previous year.

Filming for ''Queen of the Damned'' delayed the release of ''Aaliyah''. Aaliyah enjoyed balancing her singing and acting careers. Though she called music a &quot;first&quot; for her, she also had been acting since she was young and had wanted to begin acting &quot;at some point in my career,&quot; but &quot;wanted it to be the right time and the right vehicle&quot; and felt ''Romeo Must Die'' &quot;was it&quot;.&lt;ref name=Billboard2001 /&gt;

''Aaliyah'' was released five years after ''One in a Million''. Aaliyah had not intended for the albums to have such a gap between them. &quot;I wanted to take a break after ''One in a Million'' to just relax, think about how I wanted to approach the next album. Then, when I was ready to start back up, &quot;Romeo&quot; happened, and so I had to take another break and do that film and then do the soundtrack, then promote it. The break turned into a longer break than I anticipated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rapfix.mtv.com/2011/08/25/aaliyah-final-mtv-interview/|title=Remembering Aaliyah Ten Years Later: The Final MTV Interview|publisher=RAPFIX|date=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connie Johnson of the ''Los Angeles Times'' argued that Aaliyah having to focus on her film career may have caused her to not give the album &quot;the attention it merited.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jul/29/entertainment/ca-27750|title=A Coasting Aaliyah Steers Clear of Depth|date=July 29, 2001|work=Los Angeles Times|first=Connie|last=Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Despite making a profit from her career that allowed her to purchase the vehicle she wanted, Aaliyah revealed during her final interview on August 21, 2001 on [[106 &amp; Park]] that she had never owned a car due to living in New York City and hiring a car or driver on a regular basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.biography.com/news/aaliyah-facts-lifetime-movie|title=7 Facts About Aaliyah: Get The Scoop Before You Watch the Lifetime Movie|publisher=Biography.com|first=Sara|last=Bibel|date=November 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circumstances surrounding this last video were really strange because my mother had eye surgery and couldn't fly. That really bothered her because she always traveled.

===Illegal marriage===
With the release of ''Age Ain't Nothing but a Number'', rumors circulated of a relationship between Aaliyah and [[R.

Aaliyah reportedly developed a friendship with R. Kelly during the recording of her debut album. As she recalled to Vibe magazine in 1994, she and R. Kelly would &quot;go watch a movie&quot; and &quot;go eat&quot; when she got tired and would then &quot;come back and work&quot;. She described the relationship between her and R.

Kelly were &quot;close&quot; and &quot;people took it the wrong way.&quot;&lt;ref name=WBEZ&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wbez.org/blogs/jim-derogatis/2013-07/timeline-life-and-career-r-kelly-107973|title=Timeline: The life and career of R. Kelly|publisher=WBEZ 91.5 Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In his 2011 book ''The Man Behind the Man: Looking From the Inside Out'', Demetrius Smith Sr, a former member of R. Kelly's entourage, wrote that R. Kelly told him &quot;in a voice that sounded as if he wanted to burst into tears&quot; that he thought Aaliyah was pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://s2smagazine.com/2011/05/25/did-rkelly-impregnate-aaliyah/|title=Did R.

[[Jamie Foster Brown]] in the 1994 issue of ''[[Sister 2 Sister]]'' wrote that &quot;R. Kelly told me that he and Aaliyah got together and it was just magic.&quot; Brown also reported hearing about a relationship between them. &quot;I've been hearing about Robert and Aaliyah for a while--that she was pregnant. Or that she was coming and going in and out of his house. People would see her walking his dog, 12 Play, with her basketball cap and sunglasses on. Every time I asked the label, they said it was platonic. But I kept hearing complaints from people about her being in the studio with all those men. At 15,&quot; Brown said. &quot;you have all those hormones and no brains attached to them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dywEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=aaliyah&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WpyhVPOdIJLsoAT58YK4CA&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=aaliyah&amp;f=false|publisher=Vibe|date=December 1994|title=R.

Aaliyah admitted in court documents that she had lied about her age. In May 1997, she filed suit in Cook County seeking to have all records of the marriage expunged because she was not old enough under state law to get married without her parents' consent. It was reported that she cut off all professional and personal ties with R. Kelly after the marriage was annulled and ceased having contact with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080516005806/http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/kelly/939951,kellya.article|title=Kelly accused of sex with teenage girls|date=December 21, 2000|work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Jomo Hankerson stated that Aaliyah &quot;got villainized&quot; over her relationship with R. Kelly and the scandal over the marriage made it difficult to find producers for her second album. &quot;We were coming off of a multi-platinum debut album and except for a couple of relationships with Jermaine Dupri and Puffy, it was hard for us to get producers on the album.&quot; Hankerson also expressed confusion over why &quot;they were upset&quot; with Aaliyah given her age at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://madamenoire.com/441983/aaliyahs-cousin-says-villainized-r-kelly-marriage-scandal-dont-understand-upset-baby-girl/|title=Aaliyah's Cousin Says She Was 'Villainized' Over R.

Aaliyah was known to avoid answering questions regarding R. Kelly following the professional split. During an interview with Christopher John Farley, she was asked if she was still in contact with him and if she would ever work with him again. Farley said Aaliyah responded with a &quot;firm, frosty&quot; 'No' to both of the questions.&lt;ref&gt;Farley 2002, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vibe'' magazine said Aaliyah changed the subject anytime &quot;you bring up the marriage with her&quot;.&lt;ref name=VibeAugust2001 /&gt; A spokeswoman for Aaliyah told the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' in 2000 that when &quot;R.

R. Kelly would have other allegations made about him regarding underage girls in the years following her death and his marriage to Aaliyah was used to evidence his involvement with them. He refused to discuss his relationship with her, citing that she was deceased. &quot;Out of respect for her, and her mom and her dad, I will not discuss Aaliyah.

Aaliyah publicly never addressed the relationship between her and Dash as being anything but platonic. In May 2001, she hosted a party for Dash's 30th birthday at a New York City club, where they were spotted together and Dash was seen escorting her to a bathroom. Addressing this, Aaliyah stated that she and Dash were just &quot;very good friends&quot; and chose to &quot;keep it at that&quot; for the time being.&lt;ref name=VibeAugust2001&gt;{{cite news|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=gSYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA102|title=Vibe interview in August 2001|work=Vibe|date=August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just two weeks before her death, Aaliyah traveled from New Jersey to East Hampton, New York to visit Dash at the summer house he shared with [[Jay-Z]].&lt;ref name=RollingStone /&gt;

On July 18, 2014, it was announced that [[Alexandra Shipp]] replaced [[Zendaya]] for the role of Aaliyah for the [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] TV biopic movie ''[[Aaliyah: The Princess of R&amp;B]]'', which premiered on November 15, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/alexandra-shipp-play-aaliyah-lifetime-movie-article-1.1872188|title=Aaliyah biopic: Alexandra Shipp to play late R&amp;B star in Lifetime movie |work=Daily News|location=New York|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thewrap.com/lifetime-announces-premiere-date-for-aaliyah-biopic-the-princess-of-rb/&lt;/ref&gt; Zendaya drew criticism because she is biracial while Aaliyah was African-American.&lt;ref name=NYDNRace /&gt; She referred to Aaliyah as &quot;one of her biggest inspirations&quot; and insisted that while she could not &quot;please everybody&quot;, she could &quot;work really hard and just continue to show [Aaliyah's] legacy. That's all I'm focused on is really, really portraying her in the best light possible. That's all it's about.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/19/aaliyah-tv-biopic-family-block|title=Family of Aaliyah reportedly plan to block a TV biopic about the late singer|date=June 19, 2014|work=The Guardian|first=Sean|last=Michaels}}&lt;/ref&gt; She explained her decision to drop out of the film in three videos she posted on Instagram. &quot;The reason why I chose not to do the Aaliyah movie had nothing to do with the haters or people telling me that I couldn't do it, I wasn't talented enough, or I wasn't black enough. It had absolutely nothing to do with that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2014/07/zendaya-coleman-explains-exit-from-aalyiah-biopic/|title=Zendaya Coleman Explains Exit from Aaliyah Biopic|date=July 21, 2014|publisher=ABC News|first=Luchina|last=Fisher}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaliyah's family has been vocal in their disapproving of the film. Her cousin Jomo Hankerson stated the family would prefer a &quot;major studio release along the lines&quot; of ''[[What's Love Got to Do with It (film)|What's Love Got to Do with It]]'', the biopic loosely based on the life of [[Tina Turner]]. Aaliyah's family has consulted a lawyer to stop Lifetime from using &quot;any of the music, or any of the photographs and videos&quot; they own and Jomo Hankerson claimed the TV network &quot;didn't reach out.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYDNRace&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/aaliyah-family-tina-turner-style-biopic-article-1.1842106|title=Aaliyah's family wants big screen biopic with A-list star portraying late singer, not low-budget Lifetime TV movie|date=June 24, 2014|first=Corky|last=Siemaszko|work=Daily News|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 9, 2014, it was announced that Chattrisse Dolabaille and Izaak Smith had been cast as Aaliyah's collaborators Missy Elliott and Timbaland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/tv-film/6214312/aaliyah-biopic-adds-missy-elliott-and-timbaland-roles-report|title=Aaliyah Biopic Adds Missy Elliott and Timbaland Roles: Report|date=August 9, 2014|work=Billboard|first=Jocelyn|last=Vena}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolabaille received criticism for her appearance in comparison with that of Missy Elliot. ''The Urban Daily'' wrote: &quot;The hushed frustrations around the industry are mainly pertaining to the fact that the actress is nothing like Missy Elliott. She is much lighter, she is much smaller and she doesn't seem to have any Hip Hop or R&amp;B background. Some feel that the biopic creators didn't look hard enough for someone more appropriate to play Missy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://theurbandaily.com/2014/08/09/fans-unhappy-with-casting-choice-for-missy-elliott-role-in-aaliyah-biopic/|title=Fans Unhappy With Casting Choice For Missy Elliott Role In Aaliyah Biopic|date=August 9, 2014|work=The Urban Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A feature film, scheduled for release in theaters in 2015, was reported in August 2014 to star B. Simone and have involvement from Aaliyah's uncle Barry Hankerson. The film is stated to feature unreleased music by the late singer.&lt;ref name=EURweb&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eurweb.com/2014/08/singer-b-simone-set-to-star-in-new-aaliyah-biopic/|title=Singer B.
