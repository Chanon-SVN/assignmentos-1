The country sits at a unique nexus point where numerous civilizations have interacted and often fought. It has been home to various peoples through the ages, among them the [[ancient Iranian peoples]] who established the dominant role of [[Indo-Iranian languages]] in the region. At multiple points, the land has been incorporated within large regional empires, among them the [[Achaemenid Empire]], the [[Alexander the Great|Macedonian Empire]], the [[Maurya Empire|Indian Maurya Empire]], and the [[Islamic conquest of Afghanistan|Islamic Empire]].

Many kingdoms have also risen to power in what is now Afghanistan, such as the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Greco-Bactrians]], [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], [[Hephthalites]], [[Kabul Shahi]]s, [[Saffarid Dynasty|Saffarids]], [[Samanids]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Ghurid Dynasty|Ghurids]], [[Kartids]], [[Timurid dynasty|Timurids]], [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], and finally the [[Hotaki dynasty|Hotaki]] and [[Durrani dynasty|Durrani]] dynasties that marked the political origins of the modern state.

[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] exploration done in the 20th century suggests that the geographical area of Afghanistan has been closely connected by culture and trade with its neighbors to the east, west, and north. Artifacts typical of the [[Paleolithic]], [[Mesolithic]], [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze Age|Bronze]], and [[Iron age]]s have been found in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress Country Studies on Afghanistan, [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0002) Pre-Islamic Period], by Craig Baxter (1997).&lt;/ref&gt; Urban civilization is believed to have begun as early as 3000 BCE, and the early city of Mundigak (near [[Kandahar]] in the south of the country) may have been a colony of the nearby [[Indus Valley Civilization]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dupree3&quot;/&gt;

The people shared similar culture with other [[Indo-Iranians]]. The ancient religion of [[Kafiristan]] survived here until the 19th century. Another religion, [[Zoroastrianism]] is believed by some to have originated in what is now Afghanistan between 1800 and 800 BCE, as its founder [[Zoroaster]] is thought to have lived and died in [[Balkh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LOC&quot;&gt;Library of Congress Country Studies on Afghanistan, [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0003) Achaemenid Rule, ca. 550-331 B.C.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gandhara.com.au/afghan_table.html |title=Chronological History of Afghanistan&amp;nbsp;– the cradle of Gandharan civilisation |publisher=Gandhara.com.au |date=15 February 1989 |accessdate=19 May 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130727021728/http://www.gandhara.com.au/afghan_table.html |archivedate=2013-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_afghanachaemenid.htm |title=''Afghanistan: Achaemenid dynasty rule'', Ancient Classical History |publisher=Ancienthistory.about.com |date=13 April 2012 |accessdate=19 May 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131230234134/http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_afghanachaemenid.htm |archivedate=2013-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient [[Iranian languages|Eastern Iranian languages]] may have been spoken in the region around the time of the rise of Zoroastrianism.

[[Alexander the Great]] and his [[Ancient Macedonia|Macedonian]] forces arrived to the area of Afghanistan in 330 BCE after defeating [[Darius III of Persia]] a year earlier in the [[Battle of Gaugamela]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LOC&quot;/&gt; Following Alexander's brief occupation, the successor state of the [[Seleucid Empire]] controlled the region as one of their easternmost territories until 305 BCE, when they gave much of it to the Indian [[Maurya Empire]] as part of an alliance treaty. The Mauryans introduced [[Buddhism]] and controlled the area south of the [[Hindu Kush]] until they were overthrown about 185 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;LoC-pdf&quot;/&gt; Their decline began 60 years after [[Ashoka]]'s rule ended, leading to the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] reconquest of the region by the [[Greco-Bactrians]]. Much of it soon broke away from the Greco-Bactrians and became part of the [[Indo-Greeks|Indo-Greek Kingdom]]. The Indo-Greeks were defeated and expelled by the [[Indo-Scythians]] in the late 2nd century BCE.

During the first century BCE, the [[Parthian Empire]] subjugated the region, but lost it to their [[Indo-Parthian]] vassals. In the mid-to-late first century CE the vast [[Kushan Empire]], centered in modern Afghanistan, became great patrons of Buddhist culture, making Buddhism flourish throughout the region. The Kushans were defeated by the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] in the 3rd century CE. Although the [[Indo-Sassanids]] continued to rule at least parts of the region.&lt;ref&gt;Dani, A. H. and B. A.

Following the [[1842 retreat from Kabul|1842 defeat of the British-Indian forces]] and victory of the Afghans, the British established [[foreign relations of Afghanistan|diplomatic relations]] with the Afghan government and withdrew all forces from the country. They returned during the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] in the late 1870s for about two years to assist [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] defeat [[Mohammad Ayub Khan|Ayub Khan]]. The United Kingdom began to exercise a great deal of influence after this and even controlled the state's [[foreign policy]]. In 1893, [[Mortimer Durand]] made Amir Abdur Rahman Khan sign a controversial agreement in which the ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] and [[Baloch people|Baloch]] territories were divided by the [[Durand Line]]. This was a standard [[divide and rule]] policy of the British and would lead to strained relations, especially with the later new state of Pakistan.

After the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] and the signing of the [[Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919|Treaty of Rawalpindi]] in 1919, King [[Amānullāh Khān|Amanullah Khan]] declared Afghanistan a [[sovereign state|sovereign]] and fully [[independence|independent state]]. He moved to end his country's traditional isolation by establishing diplomatic relations with the international community and, following a 1927–28 tour of Europe and [[Turkey]], introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation. A key force behind these reforms was [[Mahmud Tarzi]], an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistan's 1923 [[constitution of Afghanistan|constitution]], which made elementary education compulsory. The institution of [[slavery]] was abolished in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | year = 1976| volume = Volume 25| encyclopedia = [[Encyclopedia Americana]]|publisher=Americana Corporation | page = 24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the reforms that were actually put in place, such as the abolition of the traditional [[burqa]] for women and the opening of a number of co-educational schools, quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders. Faced with overwhelming armed opposition, Amanullah Khan was forced to abdicate in January 1929 after Kabul fell to rebel forces led by [[Habibullah Kalakani]]. Prince [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]], Amanullah's cousin, in turn defeated and killed Kalakani in November 1929, and was declared King Nadir Shah. He abandoned the reforms of Amanullah Khan in favor of a more gradual approach to modernisation but was assassinated in 1933 by [[Abdul Khaliq Hazara (assassin)|Abdul Khaliq]], a [[Hazara people|Hazara]] school student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Culture and customs of Afghanistan |last1=Hafizullah |first1=Emadi |year=2005 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-313-33089-6 |page=252 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bY8ck6iktikC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140104140654/http://books.google.com/books?id=bY8ck6iktikC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA35 |archivedate=2014-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mohammed Zahir Shah]], Nadir Shah's 19-year-old son, succeeded to the throne and reigned from 1933 to 1973. Until 1946, Zahir Shah ruled with the assistance of his uncle, who held the post of [[Prime Minister of Afghanistan|Prime Minister]] and continued the policies of Nadir Shah. Another of Zahir Shah's uncles, [[Shah Mahmud Khan]], became Prime Minister in 1946 and began an experiment allowing greater political freedom, but reversed the policy when it went further than he expected. He was replaced in 1953 by [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]], the king's cousin and brother-in-law. Daoud Khan sought a closer relationship with the [[Soviet Union]] and a more distant one towards Pakistan. Afghanistan remained neutral and was neither a participant in [[World War II]] nor aligned with either power bloc in the [[Cold War]]. However, it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the Soviet Union and the United States vied for influence by building Afghanistan's main highways, airports, and other vital infrastructure. In 1973, while King Zahir Shah was on an official overseas visit, Daoud Khan launched a bloodless coup and became the first [[President of Afghanistan]]. In the meantime, [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] got neighboring Pakistan involved in Afghanistan. Some experts suggest that Bhutto paved the way for the April 1978 [[Saur Revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowersox&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Among these young men were [[Ahmad Shah Massoud|Massoud]], [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], and other members of Jawanan-e Musulman. Massoud's mission to Bhutto was to create unrest in northern Afghanistan. It served Massoud's interests, which were apparently opposition to the Soviets and independence for Afghanistan. Later, after Massoud and Hekmatyar had a terrible falling-out over Massoud's opposition to terrorist tactics and methods, Massoud overthrew from Jawanan-e Musulman. He joined [[Burhanuddin Rabbani|Rabani]]'s newly created Afghan political party, [[Jamiat-e Islami|Jamiat-i-Islami]], in exile in Pakistan. |authorlink=|year=2004|publisher=GeoVision, Inc.,|location=United States|isbn=0-9747-3231-1|page=100|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WVAN9pjnRzMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1978, the communist [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA) seized power in Afghanistan in the [[Saur Revolution]]. Within months, opponents of the communist government launched an uprising in eastern Afghanistan that quickly expanded into a [[War in Afghanistan (1978–present)|civil war]] waged by guerrilla [[mujahideen]] against government forces countrywide. The [[Pakistan]]i government provided these rebels with covert training centers, while the Soviet Union sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hussain |first=Rizwan |title=Pakistan And The Emergence Of Islamic Militancy In Afghanistan |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |year=2005 |pages=108–109 |isbn=978-0-7546-4434-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, increasing friction between the competing factions of the PDPA&amp;nbsp;— the dominant [[Khalq]] and the more moderate [[Parcham]]&amp;nbsp;— resulted in the dismissal of Parchami cabinet members and the arrest of Parchami military officers under the pretext of a Parchami coup.

In September 1979, [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]] was assassinated in a coup within the PDPA orchestrated by fellow Khalq member [[Hafizullah Amin]], who assumed the presidency. Distrusted by the Soviets, Amin was assassinated by Soviet special forces in December 1979. A Soviet-organized government, led by Parcham's [[Babrak Karmal]] but inclusive of both factions, filled the vacuum. Soviet troops were deployed to stabilize Afghanistan under Karmal in more substantial numbers, although the Soviet government did not expect to do most of the fighting in Afghanistan. As a result, however, the Soviets were now directly involved in what had been a domestic war in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kalinovsky |first=Artemy M. |title=A Long Goodbye: The Soviet Withdrawal from Afghanistan |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2011 |pages=25–28 |isbn=978-0-674-05866-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PDPA prohibited [[usury]], declared equality of the sexes,&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; and introducing women to political life.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated4&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0028) |title=Afghanistan |publisher=[[Library of Congress Country Studies]] |accessdate=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil war===
{{Main|Civil war in Afghanistan (1989–92)|Civil war in Afghanistan (1992–96)}}
From 1989 until 1992, Najibullah's government tried to solve the ongoing civil war without Soviet troops on the ground but with economic and military aid. Najibullah tried to build support for his government and tried to portray his government as [[Islamism|Islamic]], and in the 1990 constitution the country officially became an [[Islamic state (government)|Islamic state]] and all references of [[communism]] were removed. Nevertheless, Najibullah did not win any significant support, and with the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991, he was left without foreign aid. This, coupled with the internal collapse of his government, led to his ousting from power in April 1992.

After the fall of Najibullah's government in 1992, the post-communist [[Islamic State of Afghanistan]] was established by the [[Peshawar Accord]], a peace and power-sharing agreement under which all the Afghan parties were united in April 1992, except for the Pakistani supported [[Hezb-e Islami]] of [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]. Hekmatyar started a bombardment campaign against the capital city Kabul, which marked the beginning of a [[Civil war in Afghanistan (1992–96)|new phase in the war]].

In December 2001, after the Taliban government was toppled and the new [[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghan government]] under [[Hamid Karzai]] was formed, the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) was established by the [[UN Security Council]] to help assist the [[Presidency of Hamid Karzai|Karzai administration]] and provide basic security.&lt;ref&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-RES-1386(2001) |type=Resolution |body=Security Council |year=2001 |resolution_number=1386 |accessdate=21 September 2007|date=31 May 2001}}&amp;nbsp;– ([[s:United Nations Security Council Resolution 1386|UNSCR 1386]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nato.usmission.gov/ |title=United States Mission to Afghanistan |publisher=Nato.usmission.gov |date= |accessdate=14 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021065112/http://nato.usmission.gov/ |archivedate=21 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taliban forces also began regrouping inside Pakistan, while more coalition troops entered Afghanistan and began rebuilding the war-torn country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Julie |last=Fossler |url=http://afghanistan.usaid.gov/en/index.aspx |title=USAID Afghanistan |publisher=Afghanistan.usaid.gov |accessdate=14 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017104214/http://afghanistan.usaid.gov/en/Index.aspx |archivedate=17 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afghanistan.gc.ca/canada-afghanistan/news-nouvelles/2010/2010_07_09.aspx?lang=eng |title=Canada's Engagement in Afghanistan: Backgrounder |publisher=Afghanistan.gc.ca |date=9 July 2010 |accessdate=14 November 2010 |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5uLgfkxeF |archivedate = 2010-11-19|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after their fall from power, the Taliban began an [[Taliban insurgency|insurgency]] to regain control of Afghanistan. Over the next decade, ISAF and [[Afghan National Army|Afghan troops]] led many offensives against the Taliban but failed to fully defeat them. Afghanistan remained one of the poorest countries in the world due to a lack of foreign investment, [[Corruption in Afghanistan|government corruption]], and the Taliban insurgency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Video/video?id=5484891&amp;tab=9482931&amp;section=8865284&amp;page=1 |publisher=[[ABC News (US)|ABC News]] |accessdate=28 September 2010 |title=Pakistan Accused of Helping Taliban |date=31 July 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131221050959/http://abcnews.go.com/Video/video?id=5484891&amp;tab=9482931&amp;section=8865284&amp;page=1 |archivedate=2013-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/7910687/Wikileaks-Pakistan-accused-of-helping-Taliban-in-Afghanistan-attacks.html |work=The Telegraph |accessdate=28 September 2010 |title=Wikileaks: Pakistan accused of helping Taliban in Afghanistan attacks |date=26 July 2010 |location=London |first1=Rob |last1=Crilly |first2=Alex |last2=Spillius|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140129073942/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/7910687/Wikileaks-Pakistan-accused-of-helping-Taliban-in-Afghanistan-attacks.html |archivedate=2014-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the [[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghan government]] was able to build some democratic structures, and, on December 7, 2004, the country changed its name to the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Attempts were made, often with the support of foreign donor countries, to improve the country's economy, healthcare, education, transport, and agriculture. ISAF forces also began to train the [[Military of Afghanistan|Afghan armed forces]] and [[Afghan National Police|police]]. In the decade following 2002, over five million [[Afghan diaspora|Afghan refugees]] were [[repatriation|repatriated]] to the country, including many who were forcefully [[deportation|deported]] from Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Germany begins deportations of Afghan refugees |url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2005/jun2005/afgh-j25.shtml |publisher=wsws.org |date=25 June 2005 |accessdate=2 October 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20121002222758/http://www.wsws.org/articles/2005/jun2005/afgh-j25.shtml |archivedate=2012-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Living in Fear of Deportation |url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,1862149,00.html |publisher=DW-World.De |date=22 January 2006 |accessdate=2 October 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20120129193952/http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,1862149,00.html |archivedate=2012-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Afghanistan}}
[[Persian language|Persian]] (Dari) and [[Pashto language|Pashto]] are the [[official language]]s of Afghanistan; [[bilingualism]] is very common.&lt;ref name=&quot;AO&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Article Sixteen of the 2004 Constitution of Afghanistan |url=http://www.afghan-web.com/politics/current_constitution.html#preamble |quote=From among the languages of Pashto, Dari, Uzbeki, Turkmani, Baluchi, Pashai, Nuristani, Pamiri (alsana), Arab and other languages spoken in the country, '''Persian (Dari) Pashto are the official languages of the state.''' |year=2004 |accessdate=13 June 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131028065437/http://www.afghan-web.com:80/politics/current_constitution.html |archivedate=2013-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both are [[Indo-European languages]] from the [[Iranian languages]] sub-family. Dari has always been the [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige language]] and a [[lingua franca]] for inter-ethnic communication. It is the native tongue of the Tajiks, Hazaras, Aimaks, and Kizilbash.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/7798/Afghanistan/226122/Languages |title=Languages of Afghanistan |work= |accessdate= |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131112115208/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/7798/Afghanistan/226122/Languages/|archivedate=2013-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pashto is the native tongue of the Pashtuns, although many Pashtuns often use Dari and some non-Pashtuns are fluent in Pashto.

Other languages, including [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], [[Balochi language|Balochi]], [[Pashayi language|Pashayi]], and [[Nuristani languages]] ([[Askunu language|Ashkunu]], [[Kamkata-viri language|Kamkata-viri]], [[Vasi-vari language|Vasi-vari]], [[Tregami language|Tregami]], and [[Kalasha-ala language|Kalasha-ala]]), are the native tongues of minority groups across the country and have official status in the regions where they are widely spoken. Minor languages also include [[Pamir languages|Pamiri]] ([[Shughni language|Shughni]], [[Munji language|Munji]], [[Ishkashimi language|Ishkashimi]], and [[Wakhi language|Wakhi]]), [[Brahui language|Brahui]], [[Hindko language|Hindko]], and [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]].

==Governance==
{{Main|Politics of Afghanistan|Presidency of Hamid Karzai|Constitution of Afghanistan}}
[[File:Afghan parliament in 2006.jpg|thumb|The [[National Assembly of Afghanistan]] in 2006]]
Afghanistan is an [[Islamic republic]] consisting of three branches, the executive, legislative, and judicial. The nation was led by [[Hamid Karzai]] as the President and [[Afghan Transitional Administration|leader]] since late 2001 till 2014. Currently the new president is [[Ashraf Ghani]] with [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] and [[Sarwar Danish]] as vise presidents. [[Abdullah Abdullah]] serves as the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO). The [[National Assembly of Afghanistan|National Assembly]] is the legislature, a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] body having two chambers, the [[House of the People (Afghanistan)|House of the People]] and the [[House of Elders]].

The [[Afghan Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] is led by [[Chief Justice of Afghanistan|Chief Justice]] [[Abdul Salam Azimi]], a former university professor who had been a legal advisor to the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.e-ariana.com/ariana/eariana.nsf/allDocs/E78CB0C74F5E7142872571C90048D8BD?OpenDocument |title=New Supreme Court Could Mark Genuine Departure |publisher=E-ariana.com |date=13 August 2008 |accessdate=19 May 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131230235035/http://www.e-ariana.com/ariana/eariana.nsf/allDocs/E78CB0C74F5E7142872571C90048D8BD?OpenDocument |archivedate=2013-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current court is seen as more moderate and led by more [[technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]] than the previous one, which was dominated by fundamentalist religious figures such as Chief Justice [[Faisal Ahmad Shinwari]], who issued several controversial rulings, including seeking to place a limit on the [[Women's rights in Afghanistan|rights of women]].

According to [[Transparency International]]'s 2010 corruption perceptions index results, Afghanistan was ranked as the third most corrupt country in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;TI&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2010/results |title=Corruption Perceptions Index 2010 Results |publisher=[[Transparency International]] |year=2010 |accessdate=27 February 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301122514/http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2010/results |archivedate=1 March 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A January 2010 report published by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] revealed that bribery consumed an amount equal to 23% of the GDP of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/2010/January/corruption-widespread-in-afghanistan-unodc-survey-says.html |title=Corruption widespread in Afghanistan, UNODC survey says |publisher=UNODC.org |date=19 January 2010 |accessdate=14 November 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140416023007/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/frontpage/2010/January/corruption-widespread-in-afghanistan-unodc-survey-says.html |archivedate=2014-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[Council of Ministers (Afghanistan)|government ministries]] are believed to be rife with corruption, and while President Karzai vowed to tackle the problem in late 2009 by stating that &quot;individuals who are involved in corruption will have no place in the government&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/karzai-vows-to-tackle-corruption-1.827422 |title=Karzai vows to tackle corruption |publisher=CBC.ca |date=9 November 2009 |accessdate=14 November 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131230233852/http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/karzai-vows-to-tackle-corruption-1.827422 |archivedate=2013-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--deadurl=http://business.maktoob.com/20090000393686/Karzai_vows_to_tackle_corruption/Article.htm--&gt; top government officials were stealing and misusing hundreds of millions of dollars through the [[Kabul Bank]].

The [[Afghan presidential election, 2004|2004 Afghan presidential election]] was relatively peaceful, in which Hamid Karzai won in the first round with 55.4% of the votes. However, the [[Afghan presidential election, 2009|2009 presidential election]] was characterized by lack of security, low voter turnout, and widespread electoral fraud.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afghan commission orders first ballots invalidated&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=McDonald |first=Charlotte |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i3xqZSi2U_mgENDm3TK0-yqI7I_g |title=Afghan commission orders first ballots invalidated |publisher=Google |date=10 September 2009 |accessdate=14 November 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140305201430/http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5i3xqZSi2U_mgENDm3TK0-yqI7I_g |archivedate=2014-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Karzai Gets New Term as Afghan Runoff is Scrapped&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Cooper |first=Helene |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/world/asia/03afghan.html?_r=1&amp;hp |title=Karzai Gets New Term as Afghan Runoff is Scrapped |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2 November 2009 |accessdate=4 February 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110511225923/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/03/world/asia/03afghan.html?_r=1&amp;hp |archivedate=2011-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vote, along with elections for 420 [[Provinces of Afghanistan|provincial council]] seats, took place in August 2009, but remained unresolved during a lengthy period of vote counting and fraud investigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mixed Turnout&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2009/08/mil-090820-rferl02.htm |title=Mixed Turnout, Violence Seen On Afghan Election Day, As Vote Count Begins |last=Siddique |first=Abubakar |date=20 August 2009 |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=24 December 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091228010328/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2009/08/mil-090820-rferl02.htm |archivedate=28 December 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months later, under international pressure, a second round run-off vote between Karzai and remaining challenger [[Abdullah Abdullah|Abdullah]] was announced, but a few days later Abdullah announced that he would not participate in the 7 November run-off because his demands for changes in the electoral commission had not been met. The next day, officials of the election commission cancelled the run-off and declared Hamid Karzai as President for another five-year term.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karzai Gets New Term as Afghan Runoff is Scrapped&quot;/&gt;

In the [[Afghan parliamentary election, 2005|2005 parliamentary election]], among the elected officials were former mujahideen, [[Islamic fundamentalists]], warlords, communists, [[reformists]], and several Taliban associates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rawa.org/temp/runews/rawagallery.php?mghash=dc96d38caecd6694eb17fc894bb73212&amp;mggal=2 |title=RAWA Photo Gallery: They are Responsible for Afghanistan's Tragedy |publisher=RAWA |accessdate=11 October 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019075455/http://www.rawa.org/temp/runews/rawagallery.php?mghash=dc96d38caecd6694eb17fc894bb73212&amp;mggal=2 |archivedate=19 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period, Afghanistan reached to the 30th highest nation in terms of female representation in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm |title=Women in Parliaments: World Classification |publisher=Ipu.org |date=30 November 2009 |accessdate=29 December 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140328105108/http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm |archivedate=2014-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last [[Afghan parliamentary election, 2010|parliamentary election]] was held in September 2010, but due to disputes and investigation of fraud, the swearing-in ceremony took place in late January 2011.

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Provinces of Afghanistan|Districts of Afghanistan}}
Afghanistan is administratively divided into 34 provinces (''[[wilayah|wilayats]]''), with each province having its own capital and a provincial administration. The provinces are further divided into about 398 smaller provincial districts, each of which normally covers a city or a number of villages. Each district is represented by a district governor.

The [[list of current governors of Afghanistan|provincial governors]] are appointed by the [[President of Afghanistan]] and the district governors are selected by the provincial governors. The provincial governors are representatives of the central government in Kabul and are responsible for all administrative and formal issues within their provinces. There are also provincial councils that are elected through direct and general elections for a period of four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iec.org.af/eng/content.php?id=5&amp;cnid=24 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827204439/http://www.iec.org.af/eng/content.php?id=5&amp;cnid=24 |archivedate=27 August 2010 |title=Explaining Elections, Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan |publisher=Iec.org.af |date=9 October 2004 |accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The functions of provincial councils are to take part in provincial development planning and to participate in the monitoring and appraisal of other provincial governance institutions.

According to article 140 of the constitution and the presidential decree on electoral law, [[mayor]]s of cities should be elected through free and direct elections for a four-year term. However, due to huge election costs, mayoral and municipal elections have never been held. Instead, mayors have been appointed by the government. In the capital city of Kabul, the mayor is appointed by the President of Afghanistan.

[[File:Afghan soldiers.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of the [[Afghan National Army]], including the [[ANA Commando Battalion]] standing in the front]]
The [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] is in charge of maintaining the [[foreign relations of Afghanistan]]. The state has been a member of the United Nations since 1946. It enjoys strong economic relations with a number of [[NATO]] and allied states, particularly the [[Afghanistan–United States relations|United States]], [[Afghanistan–United Kingdom relations|United Kingdom]], [[Afghanistan–Germany relations|Germany]] and [[Afghanistan–Turkey relations|Turkey]]. In 2012, the United States designated Afghanistan as a [[major non-NATO ally]] and created the [[U.S.–Afghanistan Strategic Partnership Agreement]]. Afghanistan also has friendly diplomatic relations with neighboring [[Afghanistan–Pakistan relations|Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan–Iran relations|Iran]], [[Foreign relations of Turkmenistan#Afghanistan|Turkmenistan]], [[Foreign relations of Uzbekistan|Uzbekistan]], [[Afghanistan–Tajikistan relations|Tajikistan]], and [[Afghanistan–China relations|China]], and with regional states such as [[Afghanistan–India relations|India]], [[Afghanistan–Bangladesh relations|Bangladesh]], [[Foreign relations of Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]], [[Afghanistan–Russia relations|Russia]], the [[Afghanistan–United Arab Emirates relations|UAE]], Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Egypt, [[Afghanistan–Japan relations|Japan]], and [[Afghanistan–South Korea relations|South Korea]]. It continues to develop diplomatic relations with other countries around the world.

The [[United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan]] (UNAMA) was established in 2002 under [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1401]] in order to help the country recover from decades of war. Today, a number of NATO member states deploy about 38,000 troops in Afghanistan as part of the [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF).&lt;ref&gt;http://news.yahoo.com/mounting-death-toll-afghan-troops-us-general-200602525.html&lt;/ref&gt; Its main purpose is to [[NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan|train]] the [[Afghan National Security Forces]] (ANSF). The [[Afghan Armed Forces]] are under the [[Ministry of Defense (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Defense]], which includes the [[Afghan National Army]] (ANA) and the [[Afghan Air Force]] (AAF). The ANA is divided into 7 major [[Corps]], with the [[201st Corps (Afghanistan)|201st Selab (&quot;Flood&quot;)]] in Kabul followed by the 203rd in Gardez, [[205th Corps|205th Atul (&quot;Hero&quot;)]] in Kandahar, 207th in [[Herat]], 209th in [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], and the 215th in [[Lashkar Gah]]. The ANA also has a [[ANA Commando Brigade|commando brigade]], which was established in 2007. The [[Afghan Defense University]] (ADU) houses various educational establishments for the Afghan Armed Forces, including the [[National Military Academy of Afghanistan]].

===Law Enforcement===

[[File:ANP trucks in Kunar.jpg|thumb|[[Afghan National Police]] (ANP) in [[Kunar Province]]]]
The [[National Directorate of Security]] (NDS) is the nation's domestic [[intelligence agency]], which operates similar to that of the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) and has between 15,000 to 30,000 employees. The nation also has about 126,000 national police officers, with plans to recruit more so that the total number can reach 160,000.&lt;ref name=Pellerindate/&gt; The [[Afghan National Police]] (ANP) is under the [[Ministry of the Interior (Afghanistan)|Ministry of the Interior]] and serves as a single [[law enforcement agency]] all across the country. The [[Afghan National Civil Order Police]] is the main branch of the ANP, which is divided into five Brigades, each commanded by a Brigadier General. These brigades are stationed in Kabul, [[Gardez]], [[Kandahar]], [[Herat]], and [[Mazar-i-Sharif]]. Every province has an appointed provincial [[Chief of Police]] who is responsible for [[law enforcement in Afghanistan|law enforcement]] throughout the province.

The police receive most of their training from Western forces under the [[NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan]]. According to a 2009 news report, a large proportion of police officers were illiterate and accused of demanding bribes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121559123&amp;ps=cprs |title=For U.S., Vast Challenge To Expand Afghan Forces |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=19 May 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131230234157/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121559123&amp;ps=cprs|archivedate=2013-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Kem, deputy to the commander of NATO Training Mission Afghanistan and Combined Security Transition Command Afghanistan, stated that the literacy rate in the ANP would rise to over 50% by January 2012. What began as a voluntary literacy program became mandatory for basic police training in early 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pellerindate&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defense.gov//news/newsarticle.aspx?id=64044 |title=Afghan Security Forces Grow in Numbers, Quality |publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]] |work=American Forces Press Service |first=Cheryl |last=Pellerindate |date=23 May 2011 |accessdate=10 July 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140414185255/http://www.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=64044 |archivedate=2014-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 17% of them tested positive for illegal drug use.

The southern and eastern parts of Afghanistan are the most dangerous due to militant activities and the flourishing drug trade. These particular areas are sometimes patrolled by [[Taliban insurgency|Taliban insurgents]], who often plant [[improvised explosive device]]s (IEDs) on roads and carry out suicide bombings. Kidnapping and robberies are also reported. Every year [[list of Afghan security forces fatality reports in Afghanistan|many Afghan police officers are killed]] in the line of duty in these areas. The [[Afghan Border Police]] (ABP) are responsible for protecting the nation's airports and borders, especially the disputed [[Durand Line]] border, which is often used by members of criminal organizations and terrorists for their illegal activities. A report in 2011 suggested that up to 3 million people were involved in the illegal drug business in Afghanistan. Many of the attacks on government employees may be ordered by powerful mafia groups. Drugs from Afghanistan are exported to neighboring countries and worldwide. The [[Ministry of Counter Narcotics (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Counter Narcotics]] is tasked to deal with these issues by bringing to justice major drug traffickers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mcn.gov.af/en Ministry of Counter Narcotics]  {{Wayback|url=http://mcn.gov.af/en|date =20140328013458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afghanistan is an impoverished and [[least developed country]], one of the world's poorest because of decades of war and lack of foreign investment. {{as of|2013}}, the nation's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] stands at about $45.3 billion with an exchange rate of $20.65 billion, and the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|GDP per capita]] is $1,100.

While the nation's current account deficit is largely financed with donor money, only a small portion is provided directly to the government budget. The rest is provided to non-budgetary expenditure and donor-designated projects through the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations. The [[Ministry of Finance (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Finance]] is focusing on improved revenue collection and public sector expenditure discipline. For example, government revenues increased 31% to $1.7 billion from March 2010 to March 2011.

[[Da Afghanistan Bank]] serves as the central bank of the nation and the [[Afghan afghani|&quot;Afghani&quot;]] (AFN) is the national currency, with an exchange rate of about 47 Afghanis to [[United States dollar|1 US dollar]]. Since 2003, over 16 new banks have opened in the country, including [[Afghanistan International Bank]], [[Kabul Bank]], [[Azizi Bank]], [[Pashtany Bank]], [[Standard Chartered Bank]], and [[First Micro Finance Bank]].

One of the main drivers for the current economic recovery is the return of over 5 million [[Afghan diaspora|expatriates]], who brought with them fresh energy, entrepreneurship and wealth-creating skills as well as much needed funds to start up businesses.

[[File:Ariana Afghan A310-300 F-GEMO.jpg|thumb|An [[Ariana Afghan Airlines]] (AAA) [[Airbus A310]] in 2006]]
Air transport in Afghanistan is provided by the national carrier, [[Ariana Afghan Airlines]] (AAA), and by private companies such as [[Afghan Jet International]], [[East Horizon Airlines]], [[Kam Air]], [[Pamir Airways]], and [[Safi Airways]]. Airlines from a number of countries also provide flights in and out of the country. These include [[Air India]], [[Emirates (airline)|Emirates]], [[Gulf Air]], [[Iran Aseman Airlines]], [[Pakistan International Airlines]], and [[Turkish Airlines]].

The country has four international airports: [[Herat International Airport]], [[Hamid Karzai International Airport]] (formerly Kabul International Airport), [[Kandahar International Airport]], and [[Mazar-e Sharif International Airport]]. There are also around a dozen domestic airports with flights to Kabul and/or Herat.

===Rail===
{{Main|Rail transport in Afghanistan}}
As of 2014, the country has only two rail links, one a 75&amp;nbsp;km line from [[Kheyrabad, Balkh|Kheyrabad]] to the [[Afghanistan–Uzbekistan Friendship Bridge|Uzbekistan border]] and the other a 10&amp;nbsp;km long line from [[Toraghundi]] to the Turkmenistan border. Both lines are used for freight only and there is no passenger service as of yet. There are various proposals for the construction of additional rail lines in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Maps, Railways of Afghanistan, http://www.andrewgrantham.co.uk/afghanistan/tag/map/&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the presidents of Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan attended the groundbreaking ceremony for a 225&amp;nbsp;km line between Turkmenistan-[[Andkhvoy]]-[[Mazar-i-Sharif]]-[[Kheyrabad, Balkh|Kheyrabad]]. The line will link at [[Kheyrabad, Balkh|Kheyrabad]] with the existing line to the Uzbekistan border.&lt;ref&gt;Three presidents launch construction of international rail link, 06 Jun 2013, http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/infrastructure/single-view/view/three-presidents-launch-construction-of-international-rail-link.html?sword_list[]=afghan&amp;no_cache=1&lt;/ref&gt; Plans exist for a rail line from Kabul to the eastern border town of [[Torkham]], where it will connect with [[Pakistan Railways]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tolo TV|Tolo News]]&amp;nbsp;– [http://tolonews.com/en/business/4215-construction-on-kabul-torkham-railway-to-start-soon-ministry-of-mines-says Construction on Kabul-Torkham Railway to Start Soon, Ministry of Mines Says], Tamim Shaheer. 18 October 2011.  {{Wayback|url=http://tolonews.com/en/business/4215-construction-on-kabul-torkham-railway-to-start-soon-ministry-of-mines-says|date =20131109024009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also plans to finish a rail line between [[Khaf, Iran]] and [[Herat]], Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Khaf-Herat railway, http://www.raillynews.com/2013/khaf-herat-railway/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roads===
{{Further|Highway 1 (Afghanistan)}}
Traveling by bus in Afghanistan remains dangerous due to careless and intoxicated bus drivers as well as militant activities. The buses are usually older model [[Mercedes-Benz buses|Mercedes-Benz]] and owned by private companies. Serious traffic accidents are common on Afghan roads and highways, particularly on the [[Kabul–Kandahar Highway|Kabul–Kandahar]] and the [[Kabul–Jalalabad Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/26/afghan-bus-crash |title=Afghan bus crash kills 45 |publisher=theguardian.com |date=26 April 2013 |accessdate=2014-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newer automobiles have recently become more widely available after the rebuilding of roads and highways. They are imported from the [[United Arab Emirates]] through Pakistan and Iran. {{as of|2012}}, vehicles more than 10 years old are banned from being imported into the country. The development of the nation's road network is a major boost for the economy due to trade with neighboring countries. Postal services in Afghanistan are provided by the publicly owned [[Afghan Post]] and private companies such as [[FedEx]], [[DHL Express|DHL]], and others.

==Communication==
{{Main|Communications in Afghanistan}}
Telecommunication services in the country are provided by [[Afghan Wireless]], [[Etisalat]], [[Roshan (telco)|Roshan]], [[MTN Group]], and [[Afghan Telecom]]. In 2006, the [[Ministry of Communications (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Communications]] signed a $64.5 million agreement with [[ZTE]] for the establishment of a countrywide [[optical fiber cable]] network. {{as of|2011}}, Afghanistan had around 17 million [[GSM]] phone subscribers and over 1 million internet users, but only had about 75,000 fixed telephone lines and a little over 190,000 [[code division multiple access|CDMA]] subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mcit.gov.af/en |title=Statistics |publisher=[[Ministry of Communications (Afghanistan)]] |year=2006 |accessdate=17 January 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140329172724/http://mcit.gov.af/en |archivedate=2014-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[3G]] services are provided by Etisalat and MTN Group.

A number of hospitals and clinics have been built over the last decade, with the most advanced treatments being available in Kabul. The [[French Medical Institute for Children]] and [[Indira Gandhi Childrens Hospital]] in Kabul are the leading [[children's hospital]]s in the country. Some of the other main hospitals in Kabul include the 350-bed [[Jamhuriat Hospital]] and the [[Jinnah Hospital, Kabul|Jinnah Hospital]], which is still under construction. There are also a number of well-equipped military-controlled hospitals in different regions of the country.

[[Kabul University]] reopened in 2002 to both male and female students. In 2006, the [[American University of Afghanistan]] was established in Kabul, with the aim of providing a world-class, English-language, co-educational learning environment in Afghanistan. The capital of Kabul serves as the learning center of Afghanistan, with many of the best [[educational institution]]s being based there. Major universities outside of Kabul include [[Kandahar University]] in the south, [[Herat University]] in the northwest, [[Balkh University]] in the north, [[Nangarhar University]] and [[Khost University]] in the east. The [[National Military Academy of Afghanistan]], modeled after the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point, is a four-year military development institution dedicated to graduating officers for the [[Afghan Armed Forces]]. The $200 million [[Afghan Defense University]] is under construction near [[Qargha Reservoir|Qargha]] in Kabul. The United States is building six faculties of education and five provincial teacher training colleges around the country, two large secondary schools in Kabul, and one school in Jalalabad.&lt;ref name=&quot;USAID-Education&quot;/&gt;

Afghans display pride in their culture, nation, ancestry, and above all, their religion and independence. Like other highlanders, they are regarded with mingled apprehension and condescension, for their high regard for personal honor, for their tribe loyalty and for their readiness to use force to settle disputes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote&quot;&gt;Heathcote, Tony (1980, 2003) &quot;The Afghan Wars 1839–1919&quot;, Sellmount Staplehurst.&lt;/ref&gt; As tribal warfare and internecine feuding has been one of their chief occupations since time immemorial, this individualistic trait has made it difficult for foreigners to conquer them. Tony Heathcote considers the tribal system to be the best way of organizing large groups of people in a country that is geographically difficult, and in a society that, from a materialistic point of view, has an uncomplicated lifestyle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heathcote&quot; /&gt; There are an estimated 60 major [[Pashtun tribes]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/445546/Pashtun Pashtun (people)]&quot;.

Although literacy is low, classic [[Persian literature|Persian]] and [[Pashto literature and poetry|Pashto poetry]] plays an important role in the Afghan culture.

===Media and entertainment===
{{Main|Media of Afghanistan}}
[[File:Farhad Darya's Peace Concert in 2010-cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Farhad Darya]] performing at the [[Serena Hotel]] in Kabul.]]
The Afghan mass media began in the early 20th century, with the first newspaper published in 1906. By the 1920s, [[Radio Kabul]] was broadcasting local radio services. [[Afghanistan National Television]] was launched in 1974 but was closed in 1996 when the media was tightly controlled by the Taliban.&lt;ref name=&quot;dart&quot;&gt;Dartnell, M. Y. ''Insurgency Online: Web Activism and Global Conflict.'' University of Toronto Press, 2006. ISBN 978-0-8020-8553-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002, press restrictions have been gradually relaxed and private media diversified. [[Freedom of expression]] and the press is promoted in the 2004 constitution and censorship is banned, although [[defamation|defaming]] individuals or producing material contrary to the principles of Islam is prohibited. In 2008, [[Reporters Without Borders]] ranked the media environment as 156 out of 173 countries, with the 1st being the most free. Around 400 publications were registered, at least 15 local [[List of television channels in Afghanistan|Afghan television channels]], and 60 radio stations.&lt;ref name=&quot;fh&quot;&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=251&amp;year=2008 Afghanistan Press Report 2008], ''Freedom House''. {{Wayback|url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=251&amp;year=2008|date =20110623013644}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreign radio stations, such as [[Voice of America]], [[BBC World Service]], and [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] (RFE/RL) broadcast into the country.

The city of Kabul has been home to many musicians who were masters of both traditional and modern [[Music of Afghanistan|Afghan music]]. Traditional music is especially popular during the [[Nowruz]] (New Year) and [[Afghan Independence Day|National Independence Day]] celebrations. [[Ahmad Zahir]], [[Nashenas]], [[Mohammad Hussain Sarahang|Ustad Sarahang]], [[Abdul Rahim Sarban|Sarban]], [[Ubaidullah Jan]], [[Farhad Darya]], and [[Naghma]] are some of the notable Afghan musicians, but there are many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afghanland.com/entertainment/music/bio.html |title=Artist Biographies |publisher=Afghanland.com |accessdate=17 October 2011|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130809214750/http://www.afghanland.com/entertainment/music/bio.html |archivedate=2013-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Afghans are accustomed to watching [[Bollywood]] films from India and listening to its [[filmi]] hit songs. Many major Bollywood film stars have roots in Afghanistan, including [[Salman Khan]], [[Saif Ali Khan]], [[Shah Rukh Khan]] (SRK), [[Aamir Khan]], [[Feroz Khan]], [[Kader Khan]], [[Naseeruddin Shah]], and [[Celina Jaitley]]. In addition, several Bollywood films, such as ''[[Dharmatma]]'', ''[[Khuda Gawah]]'', ''[[Escape from Taliban]]'', and ''[[Kabul Express]]'' have been shot inside Afghanistan.
