'''Bengal''' {{IPAc-en|b|E|N|'|g|aw|l}} ({{lang-bn|বাংলা}} {{audio|bangla.ogg|''Bangla''}} or {{lang|bn|বঙ্গ}} ''Bongo/Bônggô'') is a geographical and ethno-linguistic region in [[South Asia]]. It lies in the north-eastern region at the [[Apex (geometry)|apex]] of the [[Bay of Bengal]] and is dominated by the [[Fertility (soil)|fertile]] [[Ganges delta]]. The region was politically divided in the 1947 [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|Partition of Bengal]] based on [[religion]]: predominantly [[Hindu]] [[West Bengal]] became a [[province]] (now a [[States and union territories of India|state]]) of [[India]], and predominantly [[Muslim]] [[East Bengal]] (now [[Bangladesh]]) became a province of [[Pakistan]]. Some regions of the [[History of Bengal|historical kingdoms of Bengal]] are now part of the neighbouring Indian states of [[Assam]], [[Tripura]], [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]], and [[Odisha]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} The [[Bengali people]] ({{lang|bn|বাঙালি}} ''Bangali''), who speak the [[Bengali language]] ({{lang|bn|বাংলা}} ''Bangla''), [[Indigenous peoples|native]]ly inhabit the region.

Bengal is one of the most densely populated regions on Earth,{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} with an estimated population of more than 250 million people{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} and a population density exceeding 900 people per [[square kilometre]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} Most of the Bengal region lies in the low-lying Ganges Delta, the world's largest [[river delta]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} In the southern part of the delta lies the [[Sundarbans]], the world's largest [[mangrove]] forest{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} and home of the [[Bengal tiger]]. In the coastal southeast lies [[Cox's Bazar]], the world's longest beach with a length of {{convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on}}.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} While most of region is [[rural area|rural]] and [[agriculture|agrarian]], it includes two [[megacity|megacities]]: [[Kolkata]] (previously Calcutta) and [[Dhaka]] (previously Dacca).

The Bengal region has a rich [[Bengali literature|literary]] and [[Culture of Bengal|cultural heritage]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} and immensely influenced [[Outline of South Asian history|South Asian history]] through the [[Bengal Renaissance]] during the 19th and early 20th centuries and the [[Bengali Language Movement]] in the mid-20th century. The Bengal was the seat of western science education and a major industrial hub in pre and post independent India and reshaped the modern Indian culture and the Bengali people made important contributions to the [[revolutionary movement for Indian independence]] and the overall [[Indian independence movement]], and, of course, successfully prosecuted the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].

{{Main|Bengali people}}
The exact origin of the word {{lang|bn|বাংলা}} ''Bangla'' and {{lang|bn|বঙ্গ}} ''Bongo'' or Bengal is unknown, though the word is believed to be derived from the Dravidian-speaking tribe called ''Bang'' that settled in the area around the year 1000 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;congress&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The [[Bengal Renaissance]] and [[Brahmo Samaj]] socio-cultural reform movements had great impact on the cultural and economic life of Bengal.

[[West Bengal]], the western part of Bengal, became a state in India. In the 1960s and 1970s, severe power shortages, strikes and a violent [[Naxalite|Marxist-Naxalite]] movement damaged much of the state's infrastructure, leading to a period of economic stagnation. The [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] of 1971 resulted in the influx of millions of refugees to West Bengal, causing significant strains on its infrastructure.&lt;ref name=&quot;londonanthology&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Bennett|Hindle|1996|pp=63–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Bengal politics underwent a major change when the [[Left Front (India)|Left Front]] won the 1977 assembly election, defeating the incumbent [[Indian National Congress]].

About 20,000 people live on chars. Chars are temporary islands formed by the deposition of sediments eroded off the banks of the Ganges in West Bengal which often disappear in the monsoon season. They are made of very fertile soil. The inhabitants of chars are not recognised by the Government of West Bengal on the grounds that it is not known whether they are Bengalis or Bangladeshi refugees. Consequently, no identification documents are issued to char-dwellers who cannot benefit from health care, barely survive due to very poor sanitation and are prevented from emigrating to the mainland to find jobs when they have turned 14. On a particular char it was reported that 13% of women died at childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wanderinggaia.com|title=Wandering Gaia|publisher=&quot;The Give and Take of the Ganges&quot; WordPress.com |date= |accessdate=13 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
Agriculture is the leading occupation in the region. Rice is the staple food crop. Other food crops are [[pulses]], potato, maize, and [[oil seeds]]. [[Jute]] is the principal [[cash crop]]. Tea is also produced commercially; the region is well known for [[Darjeeling tea|Darjeeling]] and other high-quality teas.

Historically, Europe once regarded Bengal as  &quot;the richest country to trade with&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

The common [[Bengali language]] and culture anchors the shared tradition of two parts of politically divided Bengal. Bengal has a long tradition in folk literature, evidenced by the ''[[Charyapada|Chôrjapôdô]]'', ''[[Mangalkavya]]'', ''[[Shreekrishna Kirtana]]'', ''[[Maimansingha Gitika]]'' or ''[[Thakurmar Jhuli]]''. Bengali literature in the medieval age was often either religious (e.g. [[Chandidas]]), or adaptations from other languages (e.g. [[Alaol]]). During the [[Bengal Renaissance]] of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, [[Bengali literature]] was modernised through the works of authors such as [[Michael Madhusudan Dutta]], [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]] and [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]].

The [[Baul]] tradition is a unique heritage of Bangla folk music.&lt;ref name=baulbengalonline&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other folk music forms include [[Gombhira]], [[Bhatiali]] and [[Bhawaiya]]. Folk music in Bengal is often accompanied by the [[ektara]], a one-stringed instrument. Other instruments include the [[dotara]], [[dhol]], [[flute]], and [[tabla]]. The region also has an active heritage in [[Hindustani classical music|North Indian classical music]].

Bengal had also been the harbinger of [[modernism]] in [[Indian art]]s. Abanindranath Tagore, one of the important 18th century artist from Bengal is often referred to as the father of Indian modern art. He had established the first non-British art academy in India known as the Kalabhavan within the premises of [[Santiniketan]]. Santiniketan in course of time had produced many important Indian artists like [[Gaganendranath Tagore]], [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Jamini Roy]], [[Benode Bihari Mukherjee]] and [[Ramkinkar Baij]]. In the post-independence era, Bengal had produced important artists like [[Somenath Hore]], [[Meera Mukherjee]] and [[Ganesh Pyne]].

Rice and fish are traditional favourite foods, leading to a saying that in Bengali, ''mach ar bhaath bangali baanaay'', that translates as &quot;fish and rice make a Bengali&quot;.&lt;ref name=machhe&gt;{{cite web

Bengali women commonly wear the ''[[sari|shaŗi]]'' and the [[salwar kameez]], often distinctly designed according to local cultural customs. In urban areas, many women and men wear Western-style attire. Among men, European dressing has greater acceptance. Men also wear traditional costumes such as the ''[[kurta]]'' with ''[[dhoti]]'' or ''[[pyjama]]'', often on religious occasions. The [[lungi]], a kind of long skirt, is widely worn by Bangladeshi men.

The greatest religious festivals are the two [[religious festival|Eids]] ([[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid ul-Adha]]) for the Muslims, and the autumnal [[Durga|Durga Puja]] for Hindus.&lt;ref name=durgapuja&gt;{{cite web

Around 200 dailies are published in Bangladesh, along with more than 1800 periodicals. West Bengal had 559 published newspapers in 2005,&lt;ref name=rniindia&gt;{{cite web

==Intra-Bengal relations today==
Geographic, cultural, historic, and commercial ties are growing, and both countries recognise the importance of good relations. During and immediately after Bangladesh's struggle for independence from Pakistan in 1971, India assisted refugees from East Pakistan, and intervened militarily to help bring about the independence of Bangladesh.
