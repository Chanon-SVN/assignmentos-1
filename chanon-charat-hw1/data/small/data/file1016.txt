'''Adobe Systems Incorporated''' is a [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] computer software company. Adobe Systems headquarter is based in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], California, United States. The company has historically focused upon the creation of multimedia and creativity software products, with a more-recent foray towards [[rich Internet application]] [[software development]]. It is best known for the [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) and [[Adobe Creative Suite]], later [[Adobe Creative Cloud]].

Adobe was founded in February 1982&lt;ref name=&quot;fastfacts&quot;/&gt; by [[John Warnock]] and [[Charles Geschke]], who established the company after leaving [[Xerox PARC]] in order to develop and sell the [[PostScript]] [[page description language]]. In 1985, [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] licensed PostScript for use in its [[LaserWriter]] [[computer printer|printers]], which helped spark the [[desktop publishing]] revolution.

{{as of|2009}}, Adobe Systems has 9,117 employees,&lt;ref name=&quot;fastfacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pdfs/fastfacts.pdf | title = Adobe Fast Facts|date=March 9, 2009|accessdate=April 4, 2009|format=PDF| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090326033602/http://www.adobe.com/aboutadobe/pressroom/pdfs/fastfacts.pdf| archivedate= 26 March 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; about 40% of whom work in San Jose. Adobe also has major development operations in [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]], Massachusetts; [[New York City, New York|New York City]], New York; [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], Florida; [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota; [[Lehi, Utah|Lehi]], Utah; [[Seattle]], Washington; [[San Francisco]] and [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]], California in the United States.

==History==
{{main|Adobe history}}
The company name ''Adobe'' comes from [[Adobe Creek (near Los Altos)|Adobe Creek]] in [[Los Altos, California|Los Altos]], California, which ran behind the houses of both of the company's founders.&lt;ref name=&quot;fastfacts&quot; /&gt; Adobe's corporate logo, featuring the stylized &quot;A&quot;, was designed by Marva Warnock, wife of [[John Warnock]], who is also a graphic designer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famouslogos.net/adobe-logo/|title=Adobe Logo: Design and History| publisher=Famouslogos.net|accessdate=July 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adobe's first products after [[PostScript]] were [[digital font]]s, which they released in a proprietary format called [[Type 1 font|Type 1]]. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] subsequently developed a competing standard, [[TrueType]], which provided full scalability and precise control of the [[pixel]] pattern created by the font's outlines, and licensed it to [[Microsoft]]. Adobe responded by publishing the Type 1 specification and releasing [[Adobe Type Manager]], software that allowed [[WYSIWYG]] scaling of Type 1 fonts on screen - like TrueType without the precise pixel-level control.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} But these moves were too late to stop the rise of TrueType. Although Type 1 remained the standard in the graphics/publishing market, TrueType became the standard for business and the average Windows user. In 1996, Adobe and Microsoft announced the [[OpenType]] font format, and in 2003 Adobe completed converting its Type 1 font library to OpenType.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In the mid-1980s, Adobe entered the consumer [[Computer software|software]] market with [[Adobe Illustrator]], a [[vector graphics|vector]]-based drawing program for the [[Apple Macintosh]]. Illustrator, which grew from the firm's in-house font-development software, helped popularize PostScript-enabled laser printers. Unlike [[MacDraw]], the then standard Macintosh vector drawing program, Illustrator described shapes with more flexible [[Bézier curve]]s, providing unprecedented accuracy.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} Font rendering in Illustrator, however, was left to the Macintosh's [[QuickDraw]] libraries and would not be superseded by a PostScript-like approach until Adobe released Adobe Type Manager.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Adobe Systems entered [[NASDAQ]] in 1986. Its revenue has grown from roughly $1 billion in 1999 to roughly $4 billion in 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finance.google.com/finance?q=ADBE|publisher=Google Finance|title=Adobe Systems Incorporated Company Profile}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe's fiscal years run from December to November.  For example, the 2007 fiscal year ended on November 30, 2007.

In 1989, Adobe introduced what was to become its [[flagship]] product, a graphics editing program for the Macintosh called [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]]. Stable and full-featured, Photoshop 1.0 was ably marketed by Adobe and soon dominated the market.&lt;ref name=&quot;siliconuser&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconuser.com/?q=node/10|title= How Adobe's Photoshop Was Born|accessdate=June 12, 2007|last=Hormby|first=Thomas|publisher=[[SiliconUser]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070611134528/http://siliconuser.com/?q=node/10| archivedate= 11 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Adobe introduced [[PDF]], the Portable Document Format, and its [[Adobe acrobat|Adobe Acrobat and Reader]] software. PDF is now an International Standard: [[PDF|ISO 32000-1:2008]]. The technology is adopted worldwide as a common medium for electronic documents.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

In December 1991, Adobe released Adobe Premiere, which Adobe rebranded to [[Adobe Premiere Pro]] in 2003.  In 1994, Adobe acquired [[Aldus]] and added [[Adobe PageMaker]] and [[Adobe After Effects]] to its product line later in the year; it also controls the [[TIFF]] file format. In 1995, Adobe added [[Adobe FrameMaker]], the long-document DTP application, to its product line after Adobe acquired Frame Technology Corp. In 1996, Adobe Systems Inc added [[Ares]] Software Corp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18422328.html |title= Adobe gets font technology. (Adobe Systems Inc. acquires Ares Software Corp.)  |date=June 3, 1996 |accessdate=Jul 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Adobe introduced [[Adobe InCopy]] as a direct competitor to QuarkCopyDesk.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

[[File:Adobesystemsottawa.jpg|right|thumb||Adobe Systems Canada in Ottawa, Ontario (not far from archrival [[Corel]]).]]In 1992, Adobe acquired [[OCR Systems, Inc.]]; in 1994, the company acquired [[Aldus|Aldus Corporation]]. On May 30, 1997, Adobe reincorporated in Delaware by merging with and into Adobe Systems (Delaware), which had incorporated on May 9, 1997. Adobe Systems Incorporated (Delaware), the surviving corporation, changed its name to Adobe Systems Incorporated concurrently with the merger.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The company acquired GoLive Systems, Inc. and released [[Adobe GoLive]] in 1999 and began shipping [[Adobe InDesign]] as a direct competitor to [[QuarkXPress]] and as an eventual replacement for [[PageMaker]]. In May 2003, Adobe acquired Syntrillium Software, adding [[Adobe Audition]] to its product line. In December 2004, French company OKYZ S.A., makers of 3D collaboration software, was acquired. This acquisition added 3D technology and expertise to the Adobe Intelligent Document Platform.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

On December 12, 2005, Adobe acquired its main rival [[Macromedia]] in a [[stock swap]] valued at about $3.4 billion, adding [[Adobe ColdFusion]], [[Adobe Contribute]], [[Adobe Captivate]], [[Adobe Acrobat Connect]] (formerly Macromedia Breeze), [[Adobe Director]], [[Adobe Dreamweaver]], [[Adobe Fireworks]], [[Adobe Flash]], [[FlashPaper]], [[Adobe Flex]], [[Macromedia FreeHand]], [[Macromedia HomeSite]], [[Macromedia JRun]], Adobe Presenter, and [[Macromedia Authorware]] to Adobe's product line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jefferson|last=Graham|title=Adobe buys Macromedia in $3.4B deal|url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/2005-04-18-adobe-macromedia_x.htm?csp=34|work=USA Today|date=April 18, 2005|accessdate=March 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 12, 2007, CEO, [[Bruce Chizen]] resigned. Effective December 1, he was replaced by [[Shantanu Narayen]], Adobe's current president and Chief Operating Officer. Bruce Chizen served out his term on Adobe's Board of Directors, and then continued in a strategic advisory role until the end of Adobe's 2008 [[fiscal year]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Adobe released Adobe Media Player in April 2008. On April 27, Adobe discontinued development and sales of its older HTML/web development software, [[Adobe GoLive|GoLive]] in favor of [[Adobe Dreamweaver|Dreamweaver]]. Adobe offered a discount on Dreamweaver for GoLive users and supports those who still use GoLive with online tutorials and migration assistance. On June 1, Adobe launched [[Acrobat.com]], a series of [[web application]]s geared for collaborative work.&lt;ref name=&quot;AcrobatDotCom&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.adobe.com/acom/2008/06/welcome_to_acrobatcom_work_tog_1.html|title=Welcome to Acrobat.com – Work.

===Reception===
For years hackers have exploited vulnerabilities in Adobe programs, such as Adobe Reader, to gain unauthorized access to computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pagliery |first=Jose |url=http://money.cnn.com/2013/10/08/technology/security/adobe-security/ |title=Adobe has an epically abysmal security record - CNNMoney |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2013-10-08 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe's Flash Player has also been criticized for, among other things, suffering from performance, memory usage and security problems (see [[Flash player#Criticism|criticism of Flash Player]]). A report by security researchers from [[Kaspersky Lab]] criticized Adobe for producing the products having top 10 security vulnerabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aug 17, 2011 by Jeff James in Security Blog |url=http://windowsitpro.com/blog/adobe-fares-poorly-kaspersky-lab-security-report |title=Adobe Fares Poorly in Kaspersky Lab Security Report |publisher=WindowsITPro |date=2011-08-17 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adobe has been criticized for pushing unwanted software - third-party browser toolbars and free virus scanners, usually as part of the [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] update process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/adobe-and-skype-top-my-foistware-hall-of-shame/3195 |title=Adobe and Skype top my Foistware Hall of Shame |publisher=ZDNet |date=2011-04-28 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for pushing a third-party [[scareware]] program designed to scare users into paying for unneeded system repairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/adobes-latest-critical-security-update-pushes-scareware/4681 |title=Adobe's latest critical security update pushes scareware |publisher=ZDNet |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==

==Pricing==
Adobe has been criticized for its pricing practices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39497760,00.htm?r=1|title=Adobe responds to CS4 pricing criticism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.builderau.com.au/news/soa/Adobe-defends-CS4-pricing/0,339028227,339292472,00.htm|title=Adobe defends CS4 pricing}}&lt;/ref&gt; with retail prices being as much as twice as high in non-US countries as in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativepro.com/article/creative-suite-pricing-varies-throughout-world|title=Adobe responds to customer protests against perceived unfair pricing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As pointed out by many, it is significantly cheaper to pay for a return airfare ticket to the United States and purchase one particular collection of Adobe's software there than to buy it locally in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2013/02/dont-believe-the-adobe-price-cut-hype-its-still-gauging-you-silly/| title=Don’t Believe The Adobe Price Cut Hype, It’s Still Gouging You Silly|publisher=Gizmodo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/adobe-has-its-head-in-the-clouds-over-pricing-20130215-2ehat.html| title=Adobe has its head in the clouds over pricing|publisher=The Age - Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Adobe revealed the pricing for the Creative Suite 3 Master Collection, which was £1,000 higher for European customers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/uk-will-pay-1000-more-for-adobe-cs3-3039286561/ |title=UK will pay £1,000 more for Adobe CS3 |publisher=ZDNet |date=2007-03-30 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; a petition to protest over &quot;unfair pricing&quot; was published and signed by 10,000 users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://photo.net/photography-news-forum/00LDbS |title=10,000 sign Adobe CS3 European pricing petition |publisher=Photo.net |date=2007-05-20 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, Adobe further increased its prices in the UK by 10% in spite of weakening of the pound against the dollar,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/254173/adobe-hikes-uk-prices-by-10.html|title=Adobe hikes UK prices by 10% &amp;#124; News|publisher=PC Pro|date=June 1, 2009|accessdate=May 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and UK users are not allowed to buy from the US store.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Charles Arthur |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/jun/04/adobe-software |title=Adobe widens the price gap |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Source code and customer data breach==
On October 3, 2013, the company initially revealed that 2.9 million customers' sensitive and personal data was stolen in security breach which included encrypted credit card information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24392819 |title=Adobe in source code and customer data security breach|publisher=BBC |date=2013-10-04 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adobe accounts hacked, data exposed for 2.9 million customers - Digital Photography Review |url=http://www.dpreview.com/news/2013/10/03/adobe-accounts-hacked-data-exposed-for-2-9-million-customers }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=King |first=Rachel |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57605962-83/adobe-hacked-3-million-accounts-compromised/ |title=Adobe hacked, 3 million accounts compromised &amp;#124; Security &amp; Privacy - CNET News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe later admitted that 38 million active users have been affected and the attackers obtained access to their IDs and encrypted passwords, as well as to many inactive Adobe accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-57609753-83/adobe-hack-attack-affected-38-million-accounts/ |title=Adobe hack attack affected 38 million accounts &amp;#124; Security &amp; Privacy - CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/adobe-security-breach-actually-affected-closer-to-38-million-users-7000022560/ |title=Adobe security breach actually affected closer to 38 million users|publisher=ZDNet}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company did not make it clear if all the personal information was encrypted, such as email addresses and physical addresses, though data privacy laws in 44 states require this information to be encrypted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.kioskea.net/news/24146-adobe-cyber-attack-was-a-lesson-for-corporations|title=Adobe Cyber Attack was a Lesson for Corporations - Kioskea.net|date=2013-10-29 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2013/10/09/how-safe-is-encrypted-card-data-adobe/ |title=After Security Breach Exposes 2.9 Million Adobe Users, How Safe Is Encrypted Credit Card Data? |publisher=Forbes |date= |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 3.8 GB file stolen from Adobe and containing 152 million usernames, reversibly encrypted passwords and unencrypted password hints was posted on AnonNews.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goodin |first=Dan |url=http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/11/how-an-epic-blunder-by-adobe-could-strengthen-hand-of-password-crackers/ |title=How an epic blunder by Adobe could strengthen hand of password crackers &amp;#124; Ars Technica  |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=2013-11-01 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LastPass]], a password security firm, said that Adobe failed to use best practices for securing the passwords and has not [[Salt (cryptography)|salted]] them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Finkle |first=Jim |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/11/07/us-adobe-cyberattack-idUKBRE9A61D220131107 |title=Trove of Adobe user data found on Web after breach: security firm &amp;#124; Reuters  |publisher=Uk.reuters.com |date=2013-11-07 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csoonline.com/article/742570/adobe-confirms-stolen-passwords-were-encrypted-not-hashed|title=Adobe confirms stolen passwords were encrypted, not hashed - CSO Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another security firm, [[Sophos]], showed that Adobe used a weak encryption method permitting the recovery of a lot of information with very little effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Published on 5th November 2013 by Gareth Halfacree |url=http://www.bit-tech.net/news/bits/2013/11/05/adobe-breach-2/1 |title=Adobe data breach far worse than first claimed |publisher=bit-tech.net |date=2013-11-05 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an [[Information technology|IT]] expert, Adobe has failed its customers and ‘should hang their heads in shame’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Matt |url=http://business-technology.co.uk/2013/11/adobe-should-hang-their-heads-in-shame-following-cyber-attack/ |title=Adobe 'should hang their heads in shame' following cyber attack |publisher=Business Technology |date=2013-11-05 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the credit cards were tied to the [[Creative Cloud]] software-by-subscription service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9243010/Adobe_hack_shows_subscription_software_vendors_lucrative_targets?pageNumber=1|title=Adobe hack shows subscription software vendors lucrative targets {{!}} Computerworld}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe offered its affected US customers a free membership in a credit monitoring service, but no similar arrangements have been made for non-US customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2013/10/massive-adobe-security-breach-change-your-passwords-now/ | title=Massive Adobe Security Breach: Change Your Passwords Now {{!}} Lifehacker Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2013/10/adobe-treating-australians-as-lesser-beings-even-after-details-of-2-9-million-accounts-were-stolen/| title=Adobe Treating Australians As Lesser Beings Even After Details Of 2.9 Million Accounts Were Stolen {{!}} Gizmodo Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a [[data breach]] occurs in the US, penalties depend on the state where the victim resides, not where the company is based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/11/25/us-adobe-cyberattack-idUKBRE9AO10R20131125|title=Adobe says breach notification taking longer than anticipated &amp;#124; Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After stealing the customers' data, cyber-thieves also accessed Adobe's [[source code]] repository, likely in mid-August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.infoworld.com/t/application-security/adobe-fesses-hack-fudges-details-228189|title=Adobe fesses up to hack but fudges on details {{!}} Application security - InfoWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] acquired copies of the source code of Adobe [[proprietary software|proprietary]] products,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/04/adobe-hacked_n_4042351.html|title=BBC Adobe Hacked: Cyber-Thieves Accessed Credit Card Information Of Nearly 3 Million Customers}}&lt;/ref&gt; they could find and exploit any potential weaknesses in its security, computer experts warned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/technology/adobe-announces-security-breach.html?_r=0|title=Adobe Announces Security Breach {{!}} The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Security researcher Alex Holden, chief information security officer of Hold Security, characterized this Adobe breach, which affected [[Adobe Acrobat|Acrobat]], [[ColdFusion]] and numerous other applications, as &quot;one of the worst in US history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gigaom.com/2013/10/07/ruh-roh-adobe-breach-is-just-the-beginning-researcher-says/ |title=Ruh-roh: Adobe breach is just the beginning, researcher says |publisher=Gigaom.com |date=2013-10-07 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe also announced that hackers stole parts of the source code of [[Photoshop]], which according to commentators could allow programmers to copy its engineering techniques&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24740873 |title=BBC News - Adobe hack: At least 38 million accounts breached |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2013-10-30 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would make it easier to pirate Adobe's expensive products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/adam-levin/why-the-adobe-hack-scares_b_4277064.html |title=Why the Adobe Hack Scares Me - And Why It Should Scare You &amp;#124; Adam Levin |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2013-11-15 |accessdate=2014-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a server of a Russian-speaking [[hacker group]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2054160/adobes-source-code-was-parked-on-hackers-unprotected-server.html| title=Adobe's source code was parked on hackers' unprotected server {{!}} PCWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt; the &quot;disclosure of encryption algorithms, other security schemes, and software vulnerabilities can be used to bypass protections for individual and corporate data&quot; and may have opened the gateway to new generation [[zero-day attack]]s. Hackers already used ColdFusion exploits to make off with usernames and encrypted passwords of [[PR Newswire]]'s customers, which has been tied to the Adobe security breach.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} They also used a ColdFusion exploit to breach Washington state court and expose up to 160,000 Social Security numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/hackers-breached-washington-state-court-with-adobe-coldfusion-flaw-7000015199/|title=Hackers breached Washington state court with Adobe ColdFusion flaw {{!}} ZDNet}}&lt;/ref&gt;
