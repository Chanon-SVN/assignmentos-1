'''Arabs''' ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;عرب&lt;/big&gt;}}, ''ʿarab'') are a major [[Panethnicity|panethnic group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cags.org.ae/cb404c1.pdf |title=Genetic Disorders in Arabs |author=Ghazi Omar Tadmouri |publisher=[[Centre for Arab Genomic Studies]] |date=17 March 2011 |accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They primarily inhabit [[Western Asia]], [[North Africa]], parts of the [[Horn of Africa]], and other areas in the [[Arab world]]. Arabic groups which inhabit or are adjacent to the [[Arabian plate]] and Arabic speaking people include the [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], [[Syrians]], [[Emiratis]], [[Demographics of Qatar|Qataris]], [[Demographics of Saudi Arabia|Saudis]], [[Demographics of Bahrain|Bahrainis]], [[Demographics of Kuwait|Kuwaitis]], [[Iraqis]], [[Omani people|Omanis]], [[Jordanians]], [[Palestinians]], [[Demographics of Yemen|Yemenis]], [[Sudan]]is, [[Algeria]]ns, [[Morocco|Moroccans]], [[Tunisia]]ns, [[Libya]]ns, [[Somalis]] and [[Egyptians]].

Arabic-speaking populations in general are a highly heterogeneous collection of peoples, with different ancestral origins and identities. The ties that bind the Arab peoples are a veneer of shared heritage by virtue of common [[Arabic language|linguistic]], [[Arab culture|cultural]], and [[Pan-Arabism|political]] traditions. As such, Arab [[identity (social science)|identity]] is based on one or more of [[genealogy|genealogical]], [[natural language|linguistic]] or [[culture|cultural]] grounds,&lt;ref name=Deng&gt;Francis Mading Deng [http://books.google.com/books?id=iAPLHidx8MkC&amp;pg=PA405 War of Visions: Conflict of Identities in the Sudan], Brookings Institution Press, 1995, ISBN 0-8157-1793-8 p. 405&lt;/ref&gt; although with competing identities often taking a more prominent role,&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas S. Hopkins, Saad Eddin Ibrahim eds., ''Arab society: class, gender, power, and development'', American University in Cairo Press, 1997, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; based on considerations including regional, [[Nationalism|national]], [[clan]], [[Kinship|kin]], [[Sectarianism|sect]], and [[Tribalism|tribe]] affiliations and relationships. If the Arab panethnicity is regarded as a single population, then it constitutes one of the world's largest groups after [[Han Chinese]].

The [[Arabian Peninsula]] itself was not entirely originally Arab. [[Arabization]] occurred in some parts of the Arabian Peninsula. For example, the [[language shift]] to Arabic displaced the indigenous [[South Semitic]] [[Old South Arabian]] languages of modern-day [[Yemen]] and southern [[Oman]]. These were the languages spoken in the civilisations of [[Sheba]], [[Ubar (civilazation)|Ubar]], [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]], [[Dilmun]], and [[Meluhha]]—which were spread via migrants from the Arabian peninsula, together with written script, in the 8th and 7th centuries BC to the [[Horn of Africa]] ([[Ethiopia]], [[Eritrea]], [[Djibouti]], and [[Somalia]]).

==Name==
{{Further2|[[Arab (etymology)]]}}
Originally, &quot;Arabs&quot; were synonymous with [[Arabians]] (inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula), until the [[Arabization|Arabisation]] of people with no Arabian ancestry, mostly during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. Therefore all uses of the word &quot;Arab&quot; prior to the 6th century, and most of those prior to the [[13th century AD]] refer specifically to Arabians. Later uses of the word &quot;Arab&quot; could refer to any individual whose familial ancestry corresponds to the wider [[linguistics|linguistic]] and [[panethnicity|panethnic]] definitions of Arabs.
The earliest documented use of the word &quot;Arab&quot; to refer to a [[people]] appears in the [[Monolith Inscription]], an [[Akkadian language]] record of the 9th century BC [[Assyrian Conquest of Syria]], which referred to [[Bedouins]] under [[Gindibu|King Gindibu]] who fought as part of a coalition opposed to the Assyrians.&lt;ref name=Retsop105&gt;Jan Retsö [http://books.google.com/books?id=pUepRuQO8ZkC&amp;pg=PA105 The Arabs in antiquity: their history from the Assyrians to the Umayyads], Routledge, 2003, ISBN 0-7007-1679-3, p.&amp;nbsp;105, 119, 125-127.&lt;/ref&gt; Listed among the booty captured by the army of king [[Shalmaneser III]] of [[Assyria]] in the [[Battle of Qarqar]] are 1000 camels of &quot;Gi-in-di-bu'u the ar-ba-a-a&quot; or  &quot;[the man] [[Gindibu]] belonging to the ''ʕarab''&quot; (''ar-ba-a-a'' being an adjectival [[Arabic nouns and adjectives#Nisba|nisba]] of the noun ''ʕarab''&lt;ref name=Retsop105&gt;Jan Retsö [http://books.google.com/books?id=pUepRuQO8ZkC&amp;pg=PA105 The Arabs in antiquity: their history from the Assyrians to the Umayyads], Routledge, 2003, ISBN 0-7007-1679-3, p. 105, 119, 125-127.&lt;/ref&gt;). ''ʕarab'', with the Arabic letter &quot;[[Aleph|alif]]&quot; in the second syllable, is still used today to describe Bedouins today, distinguishing them from ''ʕrab'', used to describe non-Bedouin [[Arabic language|Arabic]] speakers.

The most popular Arab account holds that the word ''Arab'' came from an [[eponymous]] father called [[Yarab]], who was supposedly the first to speak Arabic. [[Abū Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdānī|Al-Hamdani]] had another view; he states that Arabs were called '''Gharab''' (West in Semitic) by [[Mesopotamians]] because Bedouins originally resided to the west of Mesopotamia; the term was then corrupted into Arab. Yet another view is held by [[Al-Masudi]] that the word Arabs was initially applied to the [[Ishmaelites]] of the &quot;[[Arabah]]&quot; valley.

In Biblical etymology, &quot;Arab&quot; (in Hebrew ''Arvi'' {{he:ערבי}}) comes both from the desert origin of the Bedouins it originally described (''Arava'' means wilderness) and/or from the concept of mixed people. (''Arev-rav'' - a large group of mixed people.) The root ''a-r-b'' has several additional meanings in [[Semitic languages]]—including &quot;west/sunset,&quot; &quot;desert,&quot; &quot;mingle,&quot; &quot;merchant,&quot; and &quot;raven&quot;—and are &quot;comprehensible&quot; with all of these having varying degrees of relevance to the emergence of the name. It is also possible that some forms were [[metathesis (linguistics)|metathetical]] from {{transl|sem|ʿ-B-R}} &quot;moving around&quot; (Arabic {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ-B-R}} &quot;traverse&quot;), and hence, it is alleged, &quot;nomadic.&quot;

==Identity==
{{splitsection|Arab identity|discuss=Talk:Arabs#Arab identity|date=May 2014}}
Arab identity is defined independently of [[religion|religious]] identity, and pre-dates the [[spread of Islam]], with historically attested [[Arab Christian]] kingdoms and [[Jewish tribes of Arabia|Arab Jewish tribes]]. Today, however, most Arabs are Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=t7Ao8dYsCskC&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| title=The Arabs in Palestine|accessdate=March 4, 2014|author=Ori Stendel|page=45|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=1898723249}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PmgkD3Hel5IC&amp;lpg=PA309&amp;pg=PA297#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Between Heaven and Hell: Islam, Salvation, and the Fate of Others|author=Mohammad Hassan Khalil|accessdate=March 1, 2014|page=297|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;), with a minority adhering to other faiths, largely [[Christianity in the Middle East|Christianity]], but also [[Druze]] and [[Baha'i]].

Arabs are generally [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]], [[Shia Islam|Shia]] or [[Sufi]] Muslims, but currently, 7.1 percent to 10 percent of Arabs are [[Arab Christians]].&lt;ref name=Pacini&gt;{{Cite book|authorlink=Philippe Fargues |title=Christian Communities in the Middle East|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1998 |isbn=0-19-829388-7 |editor= Andrea Pacini}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure includes only Christians whose primary community language is today a variety of Arabic, and who identify as Arab.

Arab ethnic identity does not include Christian and other ethnic groups that retain non-Arabic languages and identities within the expanded Arab World. These include the [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] of Iraq and north east Syria, [[Armenian people|Armenians]] around the entire Near East, and [[Mandeans]] in Iraq—though many of these peoples speak Arabic as a first or second language. In addition, many [[Egypt]]ian [[Copts]] and [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] [[Maronites]] espouse an [[Ancient Egyptian]] and [[Lebanon|Phoenician]]-[[Canaan]]ite identity respectively, rather than an Arab one. A number of other peoples living in the Arab World are non-Arab, such as [[Berbers]], [[Kurds]], [[Turkish people|Turks]], [[Demographics of Iran|Iranians]], [[Azeris]], [[Circassians]], [[Shabaks]], [[Turkmen people|Turcomans]], [[Romani people|Romani]], [[Chechens]], [[Mhallami]], [[Sub-Saharan Africa|Sub-Saharan]] [[Africans]], [[South Asian ethnic groups|South Asians]], [[Samaritans]], and [[Jews]].

Today, the main unifying characteristic among Arabs is the [[Arabic language]], a [[South Semitic languages|South Semitic]] language from the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language family. [[Modern Standard Arabic]] serves as the [[Standard language|standardized]] and [[literary language|literary]] variety of Arabic used in writing, as well as in the most formal speech, although it is not spoken natively by the overwhelming majority of Arabs. Most Arabs who are functional in Modern Standard Arabic acquire it as a [[second language]] through education, while various [[varieties of Arabic]] are spoken as [[vernacular]]s by each distinct Arab group. Due to sociolinguistic reasons stemming from [[pan-Arab]] political and social considerations, however, these varieties are often regarded [[dialects]] rather than independent languages, despite the fact that most varieties of Arabic are not [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]], whether with each other or to Modern Standard Arabic. By contrast, neither the [[Maltese language]] is referred to as a variety of Arabic, nor are the [[Maltese people]] Arabs, despite the fact that the Maltese language is [[Philology|philologically]] a variety of Arabic in no greater or lesser extent than any of the other thus-defined Arabic varieties (sharing intelligibility with [[Tunisian Arabic]]), in addition to [[Malta]] itself lying on the [[African Plate|African tectonic plate]] along with the other Arab-defined countries of North Africa. This anomaly owes to modern-day Malta being politically aligned and within the cultural sphere of influence of [[Europe]] rather than the [[Arab world]], as was the case in Malta's earlier history.

During the [[Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age]] and Classical Era there was no Arab presence in the areas encompassed by modern [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], [[Palestine]], [[Iran]], [[North Africa]], [[Asia Minor]] or [[Kuwait]].

The Arabs are first mentioned in the mid 9th century BC as a tribal people dwelling in the mid [[Arabian Peninsula]] subjugated by the north [[Mesopotamian]] based [[Assyrians]]. The Arabs appear to have remained largely under the vassalage of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] (911-605 BC), and then the succeeding [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] (605-539 BC), Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]] (539-332 BC), [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]]/[[Seleucid Empire]] and Iranian [[Parthian Empire]]s.

Arab tribes, most notably the [[Ghassanids]] and [[Lakhmids]] begin to appear in the south Syrian deserts and southern Jordan from the mid 3rd century AD onwards, during the mid to later stages of the [[Roman Empire]] and [[Sassanid Empire]]. The [[Nabateans]] of Jordan appear to have been an Aramaic speaking ethnic mix of Canaanites, Arameans and Arabs. Thus, although a more limited diffusion of Arabic culture and language was felt in some areas by these migrant minority Arabs in ''pre-Islamic'' times through [[Ghassanids|Arab Christian kingdoms]] and [[Arab Jewish tribes]], it was only after the [[rise of Islam]] in the mid-7th century that Arab culture, people and language began their wholesale spread from the central [[Arabian Peninsula]] (including the Syrian desert) through conquest and trade.

At the time of the [[Arab]] [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th and 8th centuries AD, the population of [[Aramea]] and [[Phoenicia]] (modern [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]]) was largely [[Aramean]] and [[Phoenicia]]n, with minorities of Greeks, Assyrians, Armenians and Romans also extant, as well as pre-Islamic Arabs in the south Syrian deserts. [[Israel]]-[[Palestine]] (ancient [[Israel]], [[Judea|Judah]] and [[Samarra]]) and [[Jordan]] (ancient [[Moab]], [[Edom]] and [[Ammon]]) were largely inhabited by native [[Jews]], Samaritans, and other [[Canaanites]], together with Arameans, Greeks and Nabateans. Egypt was largely populated by natives of [[Ancient Egypt]]ian heritage together with a Greek minority, what had been [[Phoenicia]]n [[Carthage]] (modern [[Tunisia]]) by its mixed Phoenician-[[Berber people|Berber]] population. A number of [[Germanic peoples]] such as the [[Vandals]] and [[Visigoths]] were also extant as rulers throughout [[North Africa]] (modern [[Libya]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]] and [[Morocco]]) at this time.

Arab cultures went through a mixing process. Therefore, every Arab country has cultural specificities that form a cultural mix that incorporates local novelties acquired after arabization. However, all Arab countries do also share a common culture in arts (music, literature, poetry, calligraphy...), cultural products (handicrafts, carpets, henne, bronze carving...), social behavior, and relations (hospitality, codes of conduct among friends and family...), customs and superstitions, some dishes (shorba, mloukhia), traditional clothing, and architecture.

[[File:Arabic Dialects.svg|thumb|An overview of the different [[varieties of Arabic|Arabic dialects]]]]
Non-Arab Muslims, who are about 80 percent of the world's [[Muslim population]], do not form part of the [[Arab world]], but instead comprise what is the geographically larger, and more diverse, [[Muslim World]].

In the USA, Arabs are classified as white by the U.S. Census, and have been since 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.gov/population/race/about/ US Census, &quot;About Race&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-02.pdf US Census, &quot;Overview of Race and Hispanic Origin 2010&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arabic]], the main unifying feature among Arabs, is a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]] originating in [[Arabia]]. From there it spread to a variety of distinct peoples across most of [[West Asia]] and [[North Africa]],&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Arab |title=Arab |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date=22 March 1945 |accessdate=13 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100420163736/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/arab| archivedate= 20 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in their [[acculturation]] and eventual denomination as Arabs. [[Arabization]], a culturo-linguistic shift, was often, though not always, in conjunction with [[Islamization]], a religious shift.

With the rise of Islam in the 7th century, and as the language of the [[Qur'an]], Arabic became the [[lingua franca]] of the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chegne|first=Anwar G.|title=Arabic: Its Significance and Place in Arab-Muslim Society|journal=Middle East Journal|issue=19|date=Autumn 1965|pages=447–470}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this period that Arabic language and culture was widely disseminated with the early [[Spread of Islam|Islamic expansion]], both [[Muslim conquests|through conquest]] and [[Acculturation|cultural contact]].&lt;ref name=IslamAr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islam.about.com/library/weekly/aa032300a.htm |title=Islam and the Arabic language |publisher=Islam.about.com |date=3 November 2009 |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arabic culture]] and language, however, began a more limited diffusion before the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic age]], first spreading in West Asia beginning in the 2nd century, as [[Arab Christians]] such as the [[Ghassanids]], [[Lakhmids]] and [[Banu Judham]] began migrating north from Arabia into the [[Syrian Desert]], south western [[Iraq]] and the [[Levant]].&lt;ref name=BanuJ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/SM_tsn/ch1s1.html |title=Banu Judham migration |publisher=Witness-pioneer.org |date=16 September 2002 |accessdate=13 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100504125806/http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/SM_tsn/ch1s1.html| archivedate= 4 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ghassan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~andyf/hist_arab.html#Linguistic%20Situation%20in%20Pre-Islamic%20Middle%20East |title=Ghassanids Arabic linguistic influence in Syria |publisher=Personal.umich.edu |accessdate=13 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100527110812/http://www-personal.umich.edu/%7Eandyf/hist_arab.html| archivedate= 27 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, defining who is an Arab is done on the grounds of one or more of the following two criteria:
[[File:Arabic speaking world.svg|thumb|Distribution of Arabic as sole official language (green) and one of several official or national languages (blue).]]
* [[Genealogy|Genealogical]]: someone who can trace his or her ancestry to the original inhabitants of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and the [[Syrian Desert]] ([[tribes of Arabia]]). This was the definition used until [[medieval]] times, for example by [[Ibn Khaldun]], but has decreased in importance over time, as a portion of those of Arab ancestry lost their links with their ancestors' motherland. In the modern era, however, DNA tests have at times proved reliable in identifying those of Arab genealogical descent. For example, it has been found that the frequency of the &quot;Arab marker&quot; Haplogroup J1 collapses suddenly at the borders of Arabic speaking countries.&lt;ref&gt;(Regueiro et al.) 2006; found agreement by (Battaglia et al.) 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Language|Linguistic]]: someone whose [[first language]], and by extension cultural expression, is [[Arabic language|Arabic]], including any of [[Varieties of Arabic|its varieties]]. This definition covers some than 420 million people (2014 estimate). Certain groups that fulfill this criterion reject this definition on the basis of non-Arab ancestry; such an example may be seen in the way that [[Egyptians]] [[Egyptians#Identity|identified]] themselves in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=Jankowskip244&gt;Jankowski, James. &quot;Egypt and Early Arab Nationalism&quot; in Rashid Kakhlidi, ed., Origins of Arab Nationalism, pp. 244–245&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dawishp99&gt;Quoted in Dawisha, Adeed. [http://books.google.com/books?id=PjhqEusGs0UC&amp;pg=PA99 Arab Nationalism in the Twentieth Century. Princeton University Press. 2003, ISBN 0-691-12272-5, p. 99]&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative importance of these factors is estimated differently by different groups and frequently disputed. Some combine aspects of each definition, as done by Palestinian [[Habib Hassan Touma]],&lt;ref name=Toumapxviii&gt;1996, p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt; who defines an ''Arab'' &quot;in the modern sense of the word&quot;, as &quot;one who is a national of an Arab state, has command of the Arabic language, and possesses a fundamental knowledge of Arab tradition, that is, of the manners, customs, and political and social systems of the culture.&quot; Most people who consider themselves Arab do so based on the overlap of the political and linguistic definitions.

The [[Arab League]], a regional organization of [[countries]] intended to encompass the Arab world, defines an Arab as:
{{quote|An Arab is a person whose language is Arabic, who lives in an Arabic-speaking country, and who is in sympathy with the aspirations of the Arabic-speaking peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Dwight Fletcher Reynolds, ''Arab folklore'': a handbook, (Greenwood Press: 2007), p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Girls lining up for class - Flickr - Al Jazeera English.jpg|thumb|Schoolgirls in [[Gaza City|Gaza]] lining up for class, 2009]]
According to Sadek Jawad Sulaimanis the former Ambassador of Oman to the United States:{{quote|The Arabs are defined by their culture, not by race; and their culture is defined by its essential twin constituents of Arabism and Islam. To most of the Arabs, Islam is their indigenous religion; to all of the Arabs, Islam is their indigenous civilization. The Arab identity, as such, is a culturally defined identity, which means being Arab is being someone whose mother culture, or dominant culture, is Arabism. Beyond that, he or she might be of any ancestry, of any religion or philosophical persuasion, and a citizen of any country in the world. Being Arab does not contradict with being non-Muslim or non-Semitic or not being a citizen of an Arab state.&lt;ref&gt;Sadek Jawad Sulaiman, ''The Arab Identity''. Sadek Jawad Sulaiman.

The relation of ''{{transl|ar|ʿarab}}'' and ''{{transl|ar|ʾaʿrāb}}'' is complicated further by the notion of &quot;lost Arabs&quot; ''{{transl|ar|al-ʿArab al-ba'ida}}'' mentioned in the Qur'an as punished for their disbelief. All contemporary Arabs were considered as descended from two ancestors, [[Qahtan]] and [[Adnan]].

Versteegh (1997) is uncertain whether to ascribe this distinction to the memory of a real difference of origin of the two groups, but it is certain that the difference was strongly felt in early Islamic times. Even in [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] there was enmity between the Qays of the northern and the Kalb of the southern group. The so-called [[Sabaean language|Sabaean]] or Himyarite language described by [[Abū Muhammad al-Hasan al-Hamdānī]] (died 946) appears to be a special case of language contact between the two groups, an originally north Arabic dialect spoken in the south, and influenced by [[Old South Arabian]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}{{dubious|date=September 2011}}

During the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th and 8th centuries, the Arabs forged an [[Caliphate|Arab Empire]] (under the [[Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad]]s, and later the [[Abbasid]]s) whose borders touched southern [[France]] in the west, [[China]] in the east, [[Asia Minor]] in the north, and the [[Sudan]] in the south. This was one of the [[List of empires|largest land empires in history]]. In much of this area, the Arabs spread [[Islam]] and the Arabic culture, science, and language (the language of the [[Qur'an]]) through [[religious conversion|conversion]] and [[cultural assimilation]].

Two references valuable for understanding the political significance of Arab identity: Michael C. Hudson, Arab Politics: The Search for Legitimacy (Yale University Press, 1977), especially Chs. 2 and 3; and Michael N. Barnett, Dialogues in Arab Politics: Negotiations in Regional Order (Columbia University Press, 1998).

==Subgroups==
While [[Pan-Arabism]] and [[Arab nationalism]] subsume all Arabic-speaking populations under the notion of &quot;Arabs&quot;, there are numerous sub-divisions, not all of which necessarily identify as ethnically Arab.

The [[Arabians]] form a strict subset of the ethnolinguistic group of &quot;Arabs&quot; discussed here. The name of ''Arab''  historically was synonymous with Bedouin. Although, most Arabians were sedentary (not nomadic) in pre-Islamic times.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
In some parts of the Arab World, the term ''Arab'' may still carry connotations of being Arabian, conflicting with the Pan-Arabist concept of ethnicity.

Arabians are most prevalent in the Arabian Peninsula, but are also found in large numbers in Mesopotamia ([[Arab tribes in Iraq]]), the Levant and Sinai ([[Negev Bedouin]], [[Tarabin bedouin]]), as well as North Africa and the Sudan region.

;Arabian Peninsula
Arabs in the narrow sense are the indigenous Arabians (who trace their roots back to the [[tribes of Arabia]]) and their immediate descendant groups in the Levant and North Africa. Within the people of the Arabian Peninsula, distinction is made between:
*Pure Arabs or Qahtanian Arabs ({{lang|ar|العرب العاربة}}) from [[Yemen]], taken to be descended from Ya‘rub bin Yashjub bin [[Qahtan]].

*Arabized Arabs or [[Adnanites|‘Adnani Arabs]] ({{lang|ar|العرب المستعربة}}), taken to be the descendants of [[Ishmael]] and the [[Jurhum]] tribe.

This traditional division of the Arabs of Arabia may have arisen at the time of early Muslim [[First Fitna|factional infighting]] during the [[Umayyad Caliphate]].

Contrary to popular belief, most Arabians were sedentary (not nomadic) in pre-Islamic times.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Of the [[Arabian tribes that interacted with Muhammad]], the most prominent was [[Quraysh (tribe)|Banu Quraish]]. The Qur'aish sub-clan of [[Banu Hashim]] was the clan of Muhammad.
During the period of [[Muslim conquests]] and the [[Golden Age of Islam]], the political rulers of Islam were exclusively members of the Banu Quraish tribe.

;Iraq
{{Further|Arab tribes in Iraq}}
The 150 [[Arab tribes in Iraq]] are grouped into federations (''qabila''), and divided into clans  (''fukhdh''). The so-called [[Marsh Arabs]] of southern Iraq consist of numerous tribes, partly within the large [[Al-Muntafiq]] tribal alliance.

[[Iranian Arabs]] form a 2% minority in Iran. The largest group are the [[Ahwazi Arabs]], including [[Banu Kaab]], [[Bani Turuf]] and the [[Musha'sha'iyyah]] sect
. Smaller groups are the [[Khamseh]] nomads in [[Fars Province]] and the [[Arabs in Khorasan]].

;Syria and Levant
The Arabs of the [[Levant]] are traditionally divided into [[Qays and Yaman tribes]]. This tribal division is likewise taken ot date to the Umayyad period.
The Yaman trace their origin to South Arabia or [[Yemen]]; they include [[Banu Kalb]], [[Kindah]], [[Ghassanids]], and [[Lakhmids]].&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Kennedy ''The Armies of the Caliphs: Military and Society in the Early Islamic State'' p.33 Routledge, Jun 17, 2013 ISBN 1134531133&lt;/ref&gt;
Since the [[1834 Arab revolt in Palestine]], the Arabic-speaking population of Palestine has shed its formerly tribal structure and emerged as the [[Palestinian people]].

;Africa
The Bedouin of western Egypt and eastern Libya are traditionally divided into [[Sa`ada and Murabtin]], the Sa`ada group having higher social status. This may derive from a historical feudal system in which the Murabtin were vassals to the Sa`ada.

With the [[Muslim conquest of North Africa]] and [[Islamization of the Sudan region|the Sudan region]], amalgamated populations emerged, now sometimes summarized under the terms [[Arab-Berber]], [[Arabized Berber]] and [[Afro-Arab]].

[[Egyptians]] are Arabic-speaking, but the question of their idenfitication as ethnically Arab has a long and complicated history of controversy.

The Arabic-speaking population of the [[Maghreb]] ([[Libyans]], [[Algerians]], [[Moroccans]], [[Tunisians]]) is loosely divided into [[Arab-Berber]] for people of mixed Arab-Berber descent who embrace an Arab identity, and [[Arabized Berber]] for people of predominantly North African ancestry who retain a regional identity.

In [[Sudan]], there are numerous Arab tribes, including the [[Shaigya]], [[Ja'alin]], [[Shukria tribe|Shukria]], [[Rashaida]], etc. in addition, there are Arabized or partially Arabized ethnic groups such as the [[Nubian people|Nubians]], [[Copts]], or [[Beja people|Beja]]; they are sometimes united under the umbrella term of [[Sudanese Arabs]].
[[Arab slave trade]] in the Sudan region and West Africa created a clean division between Arabs and indigenous populations, and [[slavery in contemporary Africa]] substantially persists along these lines,&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Bruce S., ''A History of Race in Muslim West Africa, 1600-1960''. Cambridge University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; contributing to ethnic conflict in the region, such as the [[Sudan internal conflict (2011–present)|internal conflicts in Sudan]], [[Northern Mali conflict]], or the [[Islamist insurgency in Nigeria|Islamist insurgency in Northern Nigeria]].

==Demographics==
The total number of Arabic speakers living in the [[Arab League|Arab nations]] is
estimated at 366 million by the [[CIA Factbook]] (as of 2014).
The estimated number of Arabs in countries outside the Arab League is estimated at 17.5 million, yielding a total of close to 384 million.

According to the [[International Organization for Migration]], there are 13 million first-generation Arab migrants in the world, of which 5.8 reside in Arab countries, yielding a total of about 7 million people in the [[Arab diaspora]].

Most of the Arab countries are predominantly the youth. &quot;Over 40 percent of the region's population is under 15. Only 4 nations - Bahrain, Kuwait, UAE, and Qatar have an under 15 population less than 35 percent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Booth|first1=Marilyn|title=Arab Adolescents Facing the Future: Enduring Ideals and Pressure to Change|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=207–242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[International Organization for Migration]], there are 13 million first-generation Arab migrants in the world, of which 5.8 reside in Arab countries.

From the time of the Arab conquest of the [[Caucasus]], continuous small-scale Arab migration from various parts of the Arab world occurred in [[Dagestan]], which influenced local culture. Until the mid-20th century, some individuals in Dagestan still claimed Arabic as their native language. The majority of these lived in the village of Darvag, to the north-west of [[Derbent]]. The latest of these accounts dates to the 1930s.&lt;ref name=&quot;zelkina&quot;/&gt; Most Arab communities in southern Dagestan underwent linguistic Turkicisation, thus nowadays Darvag is a majority-Azeri village.&lt;ref name=Sefer&gt;Seferbekov, Ruslan.

Most [[Central Asian Arabic|Arabs of Central Asia]] are fully integrated into local populations, and sometimes call themselves the same as locals (for example, [[Tājik people|Tajiks]], [[Uzbeks]]) but they use special titles to show their Arabic origin such as [[Sayyid]], [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]] or [[Siddiqui]].&lt;ref name=Owensp184&gt;Arabic As a Minority Language By Jonathan Owens, pg. 184&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-Islamic===
{{Main|Pre-Islamic Arabia}}
[[File:NabateensRoutes.png|thumb|220px|Nabataean trade routes in [[Pre-Islamic Arabia]]]]
Pre-Islamic Arabia refers to Arabic civilization in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] before the rise of [[Islam]] in the 630s. The study of Pre-Islamic Arabia is important to [[Islamic studies]] as it provides the context for the development of Islam.

====Semitic origin====
[[File:Assyrian horsemen arabs.png|thumb|[[Assyria]]n horsemen pursue defeated Arabs]]
There is a consensus that the [[Semitic]] peoples originated on the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;A history of the Babylonians and Assyrians, George Stephen Goodspeed‏. p.54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Craggp13&gt;Cragg, 1991, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; It should be pointed out that these settlers were not Arabs or Arabic speakers. Early non-Arab [[Semitic]] peoples from the [[Ancient Near East]], such as the [[Arameans]], [[Akkadians]] ([[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] and [[Babylonians]]), [[Amorites]], [[Israelites]], [[Ebla]]ites, [[Ugarit]]es and [[Canaanites]], built civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]], [[Eastern Arabia]] and the [[Levant]]; genetically, they often interlapped and mixed.&lt;ref name=Semitic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/97/12/6769 |title=Journal of Semitic Studies Volume 52, Number 1 |publisher=Pnas.org |date=6 June 2000 |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slowly, however, they lost their political domination of the [[Near East]] due to internal turmoil and attacks by non-Semitic peoples. Although the Semites eventually lost political control of Western Asia to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], the [[Aramaic language]] remained the [[lingua franca]] of [[Assyria]], Mesopotamia and the [[Levant]]. Aramaic itself was replaced by Greek as Western Asia's prestige language following the conquest of [[Alexander III of Macedon|Alexander the Great]], though it survives to this day among Assyrian [[Christians]] (aka Chaldo-Assyrians) and [[Mandeans]] in [[Iraq]], northeast [[Syria]], southeast [[Turkey]] and northwest [[Iran]].

====Early history====
The first written attestation of the ethnonym &quot;Arab&quot; occurs in an [[Akkadian language|Assyrian]] inscription of 853 BCE, where [[Shalmaneser III]] lists a King [[Gindibu]] of ''mâtu arbâi'' (Arab land) as among the people he defeated at the [[Battle of Karkar]]. Some of the names given in these texts are [[Aramaic]], while others are the first attestations of [[Ancient North Arabian]] dialects. In fact several different ethnonyms are found in Assyrian texts that are conventionally translated &quot;Arab&quot;: ''Arabi, Arubu, Aribi'' and ''Urbi''. Many of the [[Qedarite]] queens were also described as queens of the ''aribi''. The [[Hebrew Bible]] occasionally refers to ''Aravi'' peoples (or variants thereof), translated as &quot;Arab&quot; or &quot;Arabian.&quot; The scope of the term at that early stage is unclear, but it seems to have referred to various desert-dwelling Semitic tribes in the [[Syrian Desert]] and Arabia.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Arab tribes came into conflict with the Assyrians during the reign of the Assyrian king [[Ashurbanipal]], and he records military victories against the powerful [[Qedar]] tribe among others.

Medieval Arab [[genealogist]]s divided Arabs into three groups:
* &quot;Ancient Arabs&quot;, tribes that had vanished or been destroyed, such as [[ʿĀd]] and [[Thamud]], often mentioned in the [[Qur'an]] as examples of God's power to vanquish those who fought his prophets.
* &quot;Pure Arabs&quot; of South Arabia, descending from [[Qahtan]]. The [[Qahtanite]]s (Qahtanis) are said to have migrated from the land of [[Yemen]] following the destruction of the [[Ma'rib Dam]] (''sadd Ma'rib'').
* The &quot;Arabized Arabs&quot; (''musta`ribah'') of Central Arabia ([[Najd]]) and North Arabia, descending from [[Ishmael]] the elder son of [[Abraham]], through [[Adnan]] (hence, [[Adnanites]]). The [[Book of Genesis]] narrates that [[God in Abrahamic religions|God]] promised [[Hagar]] to beget from Ishmael twelve princes and turn him to a great nation.&lt;sup&gt;({{Bibleverse||Genesis|17:20|HE}})&lt;/sup&gt; The [[Book of Jubilees]], in the other hand, claims that the sons of [[Ishmael]] intermingled with the 6 sons of [[Keturah]], from [[Abraham]], and their descendants were called Arabs and [[Ishmaelites]]:
{{quote|And Ishmael and his sons, and the sons of [[Keturah]] and their sons, went together and dwelt from [[Desert of Paran|Paran]] to the entering in of [[Babylon]] in all the land towards the East facing the desert. And these mingled with each other, and their name was called Arabs, and [[Ishmaelites]].|Book of Jubilees 20:13}}

[[Ibn Khaldun]]'s ''[[Muqaddima]]'' distinguishes between sedentary Arabian Muslims who used to be [[nomad]]ic, and Bedouin nomadic Arabs of the desert. He used the term &quot;formerly nomadic&quot; Arabs and refers to sedentary Muslims by the region or city they lived in, as in [[Demographics of Yemen|Yemenis]].&lt;ref name=Levity&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.levity.com/alchemy/islam20.html |title=Levity.com, Islam |publisher=Levity.com |accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christians of Italy and the Crusaders preferred the term [[Saracens]] for all the Arabs and Muslims of that time.&lt;ref name=Lionheart&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/lionheart.htm |title=www.eyewitnesstohistory.com |publisher=www.eyewitnesstohistory.com |accessdate=13 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100402073536/http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/lionheart.htm| archivedate= 2 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christians of [[Iberia]] used the term [[Moors|Moor]] to describe all the Arabs and Muslims of that time.

Muslims of [[Medina]] referred to the [[nomadic]] tribes of the deserts as the A'raab, and considered themselves sedentary, but were aware of their close racial bonds. The term &quot;A'raab' mirrors the term Assyrians used to describe the closely related nomads they defeated in Syria.

The [[Qur'an]] does not use the word ''{{transl|ar|ʿarab}}'', only the [[Arabic nouns and adjectives#Nisba|nisba]] adjective ''{{transl|ar|ʿarabiy}}''. The Qur'an calls itself ''{{transl|ar|ʿarabiy}}'', &quot;Arabic&quot;, and ''{{transl|ar|Mubin}}'', &quot;clear&quot;. The two qualities are connected for example in ayat [[Az-Zukhruf|43]].2–3, &quot;By the ''clear'' Book: We have made it an ''Arabic'' recitation in order that you may understand&quot;. The Qur'an became regarded as the prime example of the ''{{transl|ar|al-ʿarabiyya}}'', the language of the Arabs. The term ''[[I`rab|{{transl|ar|ʾiʿrāb}}]]'' has the same root and refers to a particularly clear and correct mode of speech. The plural noun ''{{transl|ar|ʾaʿrāb}}'' refers to the [[Bedouin]] tribes of the desert who resisted Muhammad, for example in ayat [[At-Tawba|9]].97, ''{{transl|ar|alʾaʿrābu ʾašaddu kufrān wa nifāqān}}'' &quot;the Bedouin are the worst in [[kufr|disbelief]] and hypocrisy&quot;.

Based on this, in early Islamic terminology, ''{{transl|ar|ʿarabiy}}'' referred to the language, and ''{{transl|ar|ʾaʿrāb}}'' to the Arab Bedouins, carrying a negative connotation due to the Qur'anic verdict just cited. But after the [[Islamic conquest]] of the 8th century, the language of the nomadic Arabs became regarded as the most pure by the grammarians following [[Abi Ishaq]], and the term {{transl|ar|kalam al-ʿArab}}, &quot;language of the Arabs&quot;, denoted the uncontaminated language of the Bedouins.

====Classical kingdoms====
{{main|Palmyra|Nabateans}}
[[File:Al Khazneh.jpg|thumb|Facade of [[Al Khazneh]] in [[Petra]], Jordan, built by the [[Nabateans]]]]
Proto-Arabic, or [[Ancient North Arabian]], texts give a clearer picture of the Arabs' emergence. The earliest are written in variants of [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraphic]] south Arabian ''[[South Arabian alphabet|musnad]]'' script, including the 8th century BCE [[Al-Hasa|Hasaean]] inscriptions of eastern Saudi Arabia, the 6th century BCE [[Lihyanite]] texts of southeastern Saudi Arabia and the [[Thamudic]] texts found throughout Arabia and the [[Sinai]] (not in reality connected with [[Thamud]]).

The [[Nabataeans]] were nomadic newcomers{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} who moved into territory vacated by the [[Edomites]]&amp;nbsp;– Semites who settled the region centuries before them. Their early inscriptions were in [[Aramaic]], but gradually switched to Arabic, and since they had writing, it was they who made the first inscriptions in Arabic. The [[Nabataean Alphabet]] was adopted by Arabs to the south, and evolved into modern Arabic script around the 4th century. This is attested by [[Safaitic]] inscriptions (beginning in the 1st century BCE) and the many Arabic personal names in [[Nabataean]] inscriptions. From about the 2nd century BCE, a few inscriptions from Qaryat al-Faw (near [[Sulayyil]]) reveal a dialect no longer considered ''proto-Arabic'', but ''pre-classical Arabic''. Five [[Syriac language|Syriac]] inscriptions mentioning Arabs have been found at [[Sumatar Harabesi]], one of which dates to the 2nd century CE.

====Late kingdoms====
{{Further|Lakhmids|Ghassanids|Kindites}}
The Ghassanids, Lakhmids and Kindites were the last major migration of non-Muslims out of Yemen to the north.
* The Ghassanids increased the Semitic presence in the then Hellenized [[Syria (Byzantine province)|Syria]], the majority of Semites were Aramaic peoples. They mainly settled in the [[Hauran]] region and spread to modern [[Lebanon]], Palestine and East Jordan.

[[Greeks]] and Romans referred to all the nomadic population of the desert in the Near East as Arabi. The Romans called Yemen &quot;[[Arabia Felix]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Diony&gt;[http://www.cartographic-images.net/Cartographic_Images/117_Dionysius_Periegetes.html Dionysius Periegetes’ World Maps]&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans called the vassal nomadic states within the [[Roman Empire]] &quot;[[Arabia Petraea]]&quot; after the city of [[Petra]], and called unconquered deserts bordering the empire to the south and east [[Arabia Magna]].
* The [[Lakhmids]] as a dynasty inherited their power from the [[Tanukh]]ids, the mid Tigris region around their capital [[Al-Hira]]. They ended up allying with the [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanids]] against the Ghassanids and the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The Lakhmids contested control of the Central Arabian tribes with the Kindites with the Lakhmids eventually destroying [[Kindah|Kinda]] in 540 after the fall of their main ally [[Himyar]]. The [[Persian people|Persian]] Sassanids dissolved the Lakhmid dynasty in 602, being under puppet kings, then under their direct control.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Bailey [http://books.google.com/books?id=Ko_RafMSGLkC&amp;pg=PR59 The Cambridge history of Iran: The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian periods], Volume 1'', Cambridge University Press, 1983, ISBN 0-521-20092-X p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Kindites migrated from Yemen along with the Ghassanids and Lakhmids, but were turned back in Bahrain by the Abdul Qais Rabi'a tribe. They returned to Yemen and allied themselves with the Himyarites who installed them as a vassal kingdom that ruled Central Arbia from &quot;Qaryah Dhat Kahl&quot; (the present-day called Qaryat al-Faw) in Central Arabia. They ruled much of the Northern/Central Arabian peninsula, till they were destroyed by the Lakhmid king [[Al-Mundhir III ibn al-Nu'man|Al-Mundhir]], and his son [['Amr III ibn al-Mundhir|'Amr]]

'''Rashidun Era''' (632-661)
{{main|Rashidun Caliphate}}
After the death of [[Muhammad]] in 632, [[Rashidun army|Rashidun armies]] launched campaigns of conquest, establishing the [[Caliphate]], or Islamic Empire, one of the [[List of largest empires|largest empires in history]]. It was larger and lasted longer than the previous Arab empires of [[Mavia (queen)|Queen Mawia]] or the [[Palmyrene Empire]], which was predominantly [[Syriac]] rather than Arab. The Rashidun state was a completely new state and not a mere imitation of the earlier Arab kingdoms such as the [[Himyarite]], Lakhmids or Ghassanids, although it benefited greatly from their art, administration and architecture.

[[File:Alhambra view.jpg|thumb|View of the [[Alhambra]] from the Mirador de San Nicolás in the Albaycin of Granada]]

In 661 the Caliphate fell into the hands of the Umayyad dynasty and [[Damascus]] was established as the [[Muslim]] capital. They were proud of their Arab ancestry and sponsored the poetry and culture of pre-Islamic Arabia. They established garrison towns at [[Ramla]], [[ar-Raqqah]], [[Basra]], [[Kufa]], [[Mosul]] and [[Samarra]], all of which developed into major cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lunde&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lunde |first=Paul |title=Islam |year=2002 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley Publishing |pages= 50–52 |location=New York |isbn=0-7894-8797-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan|Abd al-Malik]] established Arabic as the Caliphate's official language in 686.&lt;ref&gt;John Joseph Saunders, ''A history of medieval Islam'', Routledge, 1965, page 13&lt;/ref&gt; This reform greatly influenced the conquered non-Arab peoples and fueled the [[Arabization]] of the region. However, the Arabs' higher status among non-Arab Muslim converts and the latter's obligation to pay heavy taxes caused resentment. Caliph [[Umar II]] strove to resolve the conflict when he came to power in 717. He rectified the disparity, demanding that all Muslims be treated as equals, but his intended reforms did not take effect, as he died after only three years of rule. By now, discontent with the Umayyads swept the region and an uprising occurred in which the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]]s came to power and moved the capital to [[Baghdad]].

Umayyads expanded their Empire westwards capturing North Africa from the Byzantines. Prior to the Arab conquest, North Africa was inhibited by various people including [[Punics]], Vandals and Greeks. It was not until the 11th century that the [[Maghreb]] saw a large influx of ethnic Arabs. Starting with the 11th century, the Arab bedouin [[Banu Hilal]] tribes migrated to the West. Having been sent by the [[Fatimids]] to punish the Berber [[Zirids]] for abandoning [[Shia Islam|Shias]], they travelled westwards. The Banu Hilal quickly defeated the Zirids and deeply weakened the neighboring [[Hammadid]]s. Their influx was a major factor in the Arabization of the Maghreb. Although Berbers ruled the region until the 16th century (under such powerful dynasties as the [[Almoravids]], the [[Almohads]], [[Hafsids]], etc.), the arrival of these tribes eventually helped Arabize much of it ethnically, in addition to the linguistic and political impact local non-Arabs. With the collapse of the Umayyad state in 1031 AD, [[Al-Andalus|Islamic Spain]] was divided into small kingdoms.

'''Abbassid Era''' (750-1513)
{{main|Abbasid Caliphate}}

The Abbasids let a revolt against the Umayyads and defeated them in the [[Battle of the Zab]] effectively ending their rule in all part of the Empire except [[Al-Andalus]]. The Abbasids were descendants of Muhammad's uncle [[‘Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib|Abbas]], but unlike the Umayyads they had the support of non-Arab subjects of the Umayyads.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lunde&quot;/&gt; The Abbasids ruled for 200 years before they lost their central control when [[Wilayah|Wilayas]] began to fracture; afterwards, in the 1190s, there was a revival of their power, which was ended by the Mongols, who conquered Baghdad and killed the Caliph. Members of the Abbasid royal family escaped the massacre and resorted to Cairo, which had broken from the Abbasid rule two years earlier; the Mamluk generals taking the political side of the kingdom while Abbasid Caliphs were engaged in civil activities and continued patronizing science, arts and literature.

====Golden Age of Islam====
[[File:Arabic machine manuscript - Anonym - Ms. or. fol. 3306 c.jpg|thumb|Medieval Arab mechanical manuscript]]
The [[Islamic Golden Age]] was inaugurated by the middle of the 8th century by the ascension of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and the transfer of the capital from [[Damascus]] to the newly founded city [[Baghdad]]. The Abbassids were influenced by the [[Qur'an]]ic injunctions and [[hadith]] such as &quot;The ink of the scholar is more holy than the blood of martyrs&quot; stressing the value of knowledge. During this period the [[Muslim world]] became an intellectual centre for science, philosophy, medicine and education as the Abbasids championed the cause of knowledge and established the &quot;[[House of Wisdom]]&quot; (Arabic: بيت الحكمة) in Baghdad. Rival Muslim dynasties such as the [[Fatimid]]s of [[Egypt]] and the [[Umayyad]]s of [[al-Andalus]] were also major intellectual centres with cities such as [[Cairo]] and [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] rivaling [[Baghdad]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vartan&quot;&gt;Vartan Gregorian, &quot;Islam: A Mosaic, Not a Monolith&quot;, Brookings Institution Press, 2003, pg 26–38 ISBN 0-8157-3283-X&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Ottoman Empire}}
[[File:Peasant Family of Ramallah 1900-1910.jpg|thumb|Arab family of [[Ramallah]], [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem|Jerusalem District]] in early 1900s]]

Arabs were ruled by Ottoman sultans from 1513 to 1918. Ottomans defeated the Mamluk Sultanate in Cairo, and ended the Abbasid Caliphate when they assumed the title of Caliph. Arabs did not feel the change of administration because the Ottomans modeled their rule after the previous Arab administration systems.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} After [[World War I]] when the [[Ottoman Empire]] was overthrown by the [[British Empire]], former Ottoman colonies were divided up between the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[France|French]] as [[League of Nations mandate]]s.

===Modern===
Arabs in modern times live in the Arab world, which comprises 22 countries in the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of the Horn of Africa. They are all modern states and became significant as distinct political entities after the fall and [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]] (1908–1918).

Before the coming of Islam, most Arabs followed a pagan religion with a number of deities, including [[Hubal]],&lt;ref name=Hubal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Quran/Sources/Allah/hubal.html |title=Is Hubal The Same As Allah? |publisher=Islamic-awareness.org |accessdate=13 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100325235432/http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Quran/Sources/Allah/hubal.html| archivedate= 25 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wadd]], [[Al-lāt|Allāt]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=jEcpkWjYOZQC&amp;vq=Allat&amp;pg=PA34 |title=Dictionary of Ancient Deities |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-514504-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Manāt|Manat]], and [[Uzza]]. A few individuals, the ''[[hanif]]s'', had apparently rejected [[polytheism]] in favor of [[monotheism]] unaffiliated with any particular religion.

===Islam===
Today, Sunni Islam dominates in most areas, overwhelmingly so in North Africa and the Horn of Africa. Shia Islam is dominant among the Arab population in [[Bahrain]] and [[Iraq]]. Substantial Shia populations exist in [[Lebanon]], [[Yemen]], [[Kuwait]], [[Saudi Arabia]],&lt;ref name=Shia&gt;{{cite web|author=Lionel Beehner |url=http://www.cfr.org/publication/10903/shiite_muslims_in_the_middle_east.html#2 |title=Shia Muslims in the Mideast |publisher=Cfr.org |accessdate=13 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100411123648/http://www.cfr.org/publication/10903/shiite_muslims_in_the_middle_east.html| archivedate= 11 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; northern [[Syria]] and the al-Batinah region in [[Oman]]. There are small numbers of [[Ibadi]], Ahmadi and [[non-denominational Muslims]] too.&lt;ref name=&quot;ahmadi&quot;/&gt;

===Druze faith===
The [[Druze]] community is concentrated in Lebanon, Syria, Israel, and Jordan. Many [[Druze]] claim independence from other major religions in the area and consider their religion more of a philosophy. Their books of worship are called [[Kitab Al Hikma]] (Epistles of Wisdom). They believe in reincarnation and pray to five messengers from God. In Israel, the Druze have a ''status aparte'' from the general Arab population, treated as a separate ethno-religious community.

===Christianity===
[[Image:Isaac the Syrian.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|left|[[Isaac of Nineveh]], a Bahrani bishop and theologian, 7th century]]
{{Further|Christians in the Persian Gulf}}
In [[pre-Islamic Arabia]], Christianity had a prominent presence among several Arab communities, including the [[Bahrani people]] of [[Eastern Arabia]], the [[Christian community of Najran]], in parts of [[Yemen#Ancient history|Yemen]], and among certain northern Arabian tribes such as the [[Ghassanids]], [[Lakhmids]], [[Taghlib]], [[Banu Amela]], [[Banu Judham]], [[Tanukhids]] and [[Tayy]]. In the early Christian centuries, Arabia was sometimes known as ''Arabia heretica'', due to its being &quot;well known as a breeding-ground for heterodox interpretations of Christianity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kamal S.

===Judaism===
{{Further|Jewish tribes of Arabia|Arab Jews}}
The [[Jewish tribes of Arabia]] were Arabian tribes professing the [[Judaism|Jewish faith]] that inhabited the [[Arabian Peninsula]] before and during the advent of [[Islam]]. It is not always clear whether they were originally [[Israelite]] in ancestry, genealogically Arab tribes that converted to Judaism, or a mixture of both. In Islamic tradition the Jewish tribes of the [[Hejaz]] were seen as the offspring of the ancient [[Israelites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gil|first=Moshe|title=The origin of the Jews of Yathrib|year=1997|pages=4–5|url=http://books.google.com/?id=8vTTCwG0nKIC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=The+Origin+of+the+Jews+of+Yathrib#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9789004138827}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Muslim sources, they spoke a language other than Arabic, which [[Al-Tabari]] claims was Persian. This implies they were connected to the major Jewish center in [[Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibid,5&lt;/ref&gt; Certain Jewish traditions records the existence of nomadic tribes such as the [[Rechabite]]s that converted to Judaism in antiquity. The tribes collapsed with the rise of Islam, with many either converting or fleeing the Arab peninsula. Some of those tribes are thought to have merged into [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite Jewish community]], while others, like the residents of [[Yatta, Hebron|Yatta]] consider themselves Islamized descendants of [[Khaybar]], a Jewish tribe of Arabia.

[[Jew]]s from Arab countries&amp;nbsp;– mainly [[Mizrahi Jews]], [[Yemenite Jews]] and [[Maghrebi Jews]]&amp;nbsp;– are not categorized as Arab, as Jews are a separate ethnic group. Sometimes the term [[Arab Jews]] is used to describe Jews from Arab countries, though the term is highly controversial. Sociologist Sammy Smooha stated &quot;This (&quot;Arab Jews&quot;) term does not hold water. It is absolutely not a parallel to 'Arab Christian'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Vered. (2008-05-18) [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/conference-asks-iraqi-israeli-arab-jew-or-mizrahi-jew-1.246035 Conference asks: Iraqi Israeli, Arab Jew or Mizrahi Jew? - Israel News | Haaretz Daily Newspaper]. Haaretz.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who dispute the [[historicity]] of the term make the claim that Middle Eastern Jews are similar to [[Kurds]], [[Assyrians]], [[Berbers]] and other ancient Middle Eastern groups, who lived among the Arab societies as distinct minority groups with distinct identity and therefore are not categorized as Arabs.

==Culture==
[[Image:Maler der Geschichte von Bayâd und Riyâd 002.jpg|thumb|left|&quot;Bayad plays the [[oud]] to the lady&quot;, [[Arabic language|Arabic]]manuscript for Qissat Bayad wa Reyad tale from late 12th century]]

[[Arab culture]] is a term that draws together the common themes and overtones found in the Arab countries, especially those of the [[Middle-Eastern]] countries. This region's distinct religion, art, and food are some of the fundamental features that define Arab culture.

===Art===
[[Arabic Art]] includes a wide range or artistic components, it can be [[Arabic miniature]], calligraphy or [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]].

===Architecture===
[[Arab Architecture]] has a deep diverse history, it dates to the dawn of the history in pre-Islamic Arabia. Each of it phases largely an extension of the earlier phase, it left also heavy impact on the architecture of other nations.

===Music===
[[File:Casino du Liban Concert 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Lydia Canaan, First Rock Star of the Middle East]]
[[Arabic music]] is the music of Arab people or countries, especially those centered on the Arabian Peninsula. The world of Arab music has long been dominated by [[Cairo]], a cultural center, though musical innovation and regional styles abound from Morocco to [[Saudi Arabia]]. [[Beirut]] has, in recent years, also become a major center of Arabic music; [[Lydia Canaan]], generally regarded as the first rock star of the [[Middle East]],&lt;ref&gt;Edward D'Mello, ''Gulf News'', November 29, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://reddeerinternationalgreatpeopleoftheworld.wordpress.com/2014/10/09/lydia-canaan-passion-for-music-and-humanity/ Fumiya Akashika, ''RedDeer International'', October 10, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; fused her English lyrics and Western sound with Middle-Eastern quarter notes and became the first internationally successful Lebanese recording artist. [[Classical Arab music]] is extremely popular across the population, especially a small number of superstars known throughout the Arab world. [[File:Bmane2002-1-114,1.jpg|thumb|left|120px|[[Qataban]]ian era musical scene, 1st century AD]] Regional styles of popular music include [[Algeria]]n [[raï]], [[Morocco|Moroccan]] [[gnawa]], [[Kuwait]]i [[Sawt (music)|sawt]], [[Culture of Egypt|Egyptian]] [[el gil]] and Arabesque-pop music in [[Turkey]].
Most historians agree that distinct forms of music existed in the Arabian peninsula in the pre-Islamic period between the 5th and 7th century AD. Arab poets of that time—called shu`ara' al-Jahiliyah (شعراء الجاهلية) or &quot;Jahili poets&quot;, meaning &quot;the poets of the period of ignorance&quot;—recited poems with a high note.
Tradition believes that [[Jinn]]s revealed poems to poets, and music to musicians. The choir of the time was a pedagogic facility where educated poets recited poems. Singing was thought not the work of intellectuals, and was instead entrusted to women who learned to play instruments of the time, such as the drum, oud, or rebab, and perform the songs while respecting the poetic metre.

===Literature===
{{main|Arabic literature}}
[[File:Khalil Gibran - Autorretrato con musa, c. 1911.jpg|thumb|120px|Self portrait of renown Lebanese poet/writer [[Khalil Gibran]]]]

There is a small remnant of [[pre-Islamic poetry]], but Arabic literature predominantly emerges in the Middle Ages, during the [[Golden Age of Islam]].

[[Literary Arabic]] is derived from [[Classical Arabic]], based on the language of the [[Qu'ran]] as it was analyzed by [[Arabic grammarians]] beginning in the 8th century.

A large portion of Arabic literature prior to the 20th century is in the form of [[Arabic poetry|poetry]], and even prose from this period is either filled with snippets of poetry or is in the form of ''[[saj (literature)|saj]]'' or rhymed prose.
The ''[[ghazal]]'' or love poem had a long history being at times tender and chaste and at other times rather explicit.  In the [[Sufi]] tradition the love poem would take on a wider, mystical and religious importance.
[[Arabic epic literature]] was much less common than poetry, and presumably originates in oral tradition, written down from the 14th century or so.
[[Maqama]]  or [[rhymed prose]] is intermediate between poetry and prose, and also between fiction and non-fiction. Maqama was an incredibly popular form of Arabic literature, being one of the few forms which continued to be written during the decline of Arabic in the 17th and 18th centuries.

Arabic literature and culture declined significantly after the 13th century, to the benefit of [[Ottoman Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Persian literature|Persian]].

[[File:Ahlem Mosteghanemi in 2000.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Ahlem Mosteghanemi]], renowned Arab writer, in 2009]]

A modern revival took place beginning in the 19th century, alongside [[national awakenings under the Ottoman Empire|resistance against Ottoman rule]]. The literary revival is known as ''[[al-Nahda]]'' in Arabic, and was centered in Egypt and Lebanon.

Two distinct trends can be found in the ''nahda'' period of revival. The first was a neo-classical movement which sought to rediscover the literary traditions of the past, and was influenced by traditional literary genres&amp;mdash;such as the ''[[maqama]]''&amp;mdash;and works like ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]''. In contrast, a modernist movement began by translating Western modernist works&amp;mdash;primarily novels&amp;mdash;into Arabic.

A tradition of [[modern Arabic poetry]] was established by writers such as [[Francis Marrash]], [[Ahmad Shawqi]] and [[Hafiz Ibrahim]].
Iraqi poet [[Badr Shakir al-Sayyab]] is considered to be the originator of free verse in Arabic poetry.

==Genetics==

===Y-Chromosome===
[[Haplogroup]] [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] is the most frequent haplogroup in Western Arabs ([[Maghrebis]]) while haplogroup [[Haplogroup J-M267|J]] is the most frequent haplogroup in Eastern Arabs ([[Mashriq]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1371/journal.pone.0056775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paternal ancestry found across all Arabic countries is Haplogroup J1, especially its major subclade J-P58, the haplogroup that spread with Arabic conquest in the 7th century. It was found that Haplogroup J1 occur at high frequencies among the Arabic-speaking populations of the Middle East and is the prevalent Y-chromosome lineage within the Near East. Haplogroup J1e (J-P58) is also associated with a Semitic linguistic common denominator, with the YCAII 22-22 allele state is closely associated with J1e.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chiaroni et Al|title=The emergence of Y-chromosome haplogroup J1e among Arabic-speaking populations|journal=European Journal of Human Genetics|date=14 October 2009|volume=18|issue=3|pages=348–353|doi=10.1038/ejhg.2009.166|pmid=19826455|pmc=2987219|last2=King|first2=Roy J|last3=Myres|first3=Natalie M|last4=Henn|first4=Brenna M|last5=Ducourneau|first5=Axel|last6=Mitchell|first6=Michael J|last7=Boetsch|first7=Gilles|last8=Sheikha|first8=Issa|last9=Lin|first9=Alice A|last10=Nik-Ahd|first10=Mahnoosh|last11=Ahmad|first11=Jabeen|last12=Lattanzi|first12=Francesca|last13=Herrera|first13=Rene J|last14=Ibrahim|first14=Muntaser E|last15=Brody|first15=Aaron|last16=Semino|first16=Ornella|last17=Kivisild|first17=Toomas|last18=Underhill|first18=Peter A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===mtDNA Analysis===

The Maternal ancestral lineages of Arabic countries are very diverse. The original Historical Maternal ancestral Haplogroups of the Near East were Mt (Maternal) L3 Haplogroup and Mt HV1 haplogroup that are still high in Yemen, while in [[Greater Syria]] there is a European Maternal gene flow. In the Arabic West the dominant Maternal lineage is the rare Scandinavian European U8 haplogroup probably came with the Vandals when escaped from Spain from the Visigoths.&lt;ref name=&quot;Al-Zahery 288&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Al-Zahery|first=N|author2=Pala, M|author3=Battaglia, V|author4=Grugni, V|author5=Hamod, MA|author6=Hooshiar Kashani, B|author7=Olivieri, A|author8=Torroni, A|author9=Santachiara-Benerecetti, AS|author10= Semino, O|title=In search of the genetic footprints of Sumerians: a survey of Y-chromosome and mtDNA variation in the Marsh Arabs of Iraq.|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|date=4 October 2011|volume=11|pages=288|pmid=21970613|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-11-288|pmc=3215667}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yanni 408–13&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yanni|first=EA|author2=Copeland, G|author3= Olney, RS|title=Birth defects and genetic disorders among Arab Americans&amp;mdash;Michigan, 1992-2003.|journal=Journal of immigrant and minority health / Center for Minority Public Health|date=June 2010|volume=12|issue=3|pages=408–13|pmid=18972209|doi=10.1007/s10903-008-9203-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hassan 316–23&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hassan|first=HY|author2=Underhill, PA|author3= Cavalli-Sforza, LL|author4= Ibrahim, ME|title=Y-chromosome variation among Sudanese: restricted gene flow, concordance with language, geography, and history.|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|date=November 2008|volume=137|issue=3|pages=316–23|pmid=18618658|doi=10.1002/ajpa.20876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Chromosomes===

Many of the pronounced genetic deficiencies in Arabs (causing [[Genetic studies on Arabs|genetic disorders specific to Arabs]]) are located on HLA segment on chromosome 6. This same segment mutations are also markers of Arabs in Genealogical and forensic profiling tests and studies. Such studies as:
Arab population data on the PCR-based loci: HLA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hayes|first=JM|author2=Budowle, B|author3= Freund, M|title=Arab population data on the PCR-based loci: HLA-DQA1, LDLR, GYPA, HBGG, D7S8, Gc, and D1S80.|journal=Journal of forensic sciences|date=September 1995|volume=40|issue=5|pages=888–92|pmid=7595333}}&lt;/ref&gt;
