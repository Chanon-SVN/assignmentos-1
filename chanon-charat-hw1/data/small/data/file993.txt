'''Antlia''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|n|t|l|i|ə}}; from [[Ancient Greek]] ''ἀντλία'') is a [[constellation]] in the southern sky. Its name means &quot;[[pump]]&quot; and it specifically represents an air pump. The constellation was created in the 18th century from an undesignated region of sky, so the stars comprising Antlia are faint. Antlia is bordered by [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] the sea snake, [[Pyxis]] the compass, [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]] the sails, and [[Centaurus]] the centaur. This group of constellations is prominent in the southern sky in late winter and spring. [[NGC 2997]], a [[spiral galaxy]], and the [[Antlia Dwarf|Antlia Dwarf Galaxy]] lie within Antlia's borders.

==History==
[[File:Antlia bode.JPG|thumb|border|300px|left|Johann Bode's depiction of Antlia.]]
Antlia was created in 1756 by the French astronomer Abbé [[Nicolas Louis de Lacaille]], who created fourteen constellations for the southern sky to fill some faint regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;startales&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;princeton&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ridpath|2001|pp=74–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Antlia was technically visible to ancient Greek astronomers, its stars were too faint to have been included in any constellations.&lt;ref name=&quot;startales&quot;/&gt; Because of this, its main stars have no particular pattern and it is devoid of bright deep-sky objects.&lt;ref name=&quot;moore&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pasachoff&quot;/&gt; It was originally named ''Antlia pneumatica'' (&quot;Machine Pneumatique&quot; in [[French language|French]])&lt;ref name=&quot;pasachoff&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Pasachoff|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; to commemorate the [[air pump]] invented by the French physicist [[Denis Papin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;startales&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last = Ridpath |first = Ian |work= Star Tales |title= Antlia |url=http://www.ianridpath.com/startales/antlia.htm |accessdate=3 December 2007| &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;princeton&quot;/&gt;

Lacaille and [[Johann Bode]] each depicted Antlia differently, as either the single-cylinder vacuum pump used in Papin's initial experiments, or the more advanced double-cylinder version.&lt;ref name=&quot;startales&quot;/&gt; The [[International Astronomical Union]] subsequently adopted it as one of the 88 modern constellations. There is no mythology attached to Antlia as Lacaille discontinued the tradition of giving names from mythology to constellations and instead chose names mostly from scientific instruments.&lt;ref name=&quot;startales&quot;/&gt;

According to some, the most prominent stars that now comprise Antlia were once included within the ancient constellation [[Argo Navis]], the Ship of the Argonauts, which due to its immense size was split into several smaller constellations by Lacaille in 1763.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Birren (2002) Objects in the Heavens, pp. 9, 45 (ISBN 155369662X).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas William Webb (Dover Publications 1962) Celestial objects for common telescopes, Volume 2, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; However, given the faintness and obscurity of its stars, most authorities do not believe that the ancient Greeks included Antlia as part of their classical depiction of Argo Navis.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Ridpath (2002) Stars and Planets, pp, 65, 122. (ISBN 0-7894-8988-0)&lt;/ref&gt;

== In non-Western astronomy ==
Chinese astronomers were able to view what is modern Antlia from their latitudes, and incorporated its stars into two different constellations. Several stars in the southern part of Antlia were a portion of &quot;''Dong'ou''&quot;, which represented an area in southern China.&lt;ref name=&quot;startales&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, [[Epsilon Antliae|Epsilon]], [[Eta Antliae|Eta]], and [[theta Antliae]] were incorporated into the celestial temple, which also contained stars from modern [[Pyxis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;startales&quot;/&gt;

===Stars===
Lacaille gave nine stars [[Bayer designation]]s, labelling them Alpha through to Theta, including two stars next to each other as Zeta. Gould later added a tenth, [[Iota Antliae]]. Beta and Gamma Antliae (now [[HR 4339]] and [[HD 90156]]) ended up in the neighbouring constellation Hydra once the constellation boundaries were delineated in 1930.{{sfn|Wagman|2003|p=29}}

The constellation's brightest star,&lt;ref name=&quot;moore&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Moore|Tirion|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alpha Antliae]] is an orange [[giant star|giant]] of [[Stellar classification#Spectral types|spectral type]] K4III that is a suspected [[variable star]], ranging between [[apparent magnitude]]s 4.22 and 4.29.&lt;ref name=AAVSOalf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aavso.org/vsx/index.php?view=detail.top&amp;oid=43486 |title=Alpha Antliae |author =Watson, Christopher |date=18 January 2010 |work=AAVSO Website|publisher=American Association of Variable Star Observers|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is

[[Zeta Antliae]] is a wide double star 373 light years away. The primary ([[Zeta1 Antliae|Zeta&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Antliae]]) is of magnitude 5.8, though it is a double star with a primary of magnitude 6.2 and a secondary of magnitude 7.0.

[[DEN 1048-3956]] is a [[brown dwarf]] located around 13 light-years distant from Earth. At magnitude 17 it is much too faint to be seen with the unaided eye.

===Deep-sky objects===
[[File:NGC 2997 ESO.jpg|thumb|border|left|300px|A composite image of NGC 2997.]]
Because it occupies a part of the [[celestial sphere]] that faces away from the [[Milky Way]], Antlia contains very few deep-sky objects. It contains no [[globular cluster]]s, no [[planetary nebula]]e, and no [[open cluster]]s. However, it does contain several galaxies.

[[NGC 2997]] is a loose face-on [[spiral galaxy]] of type [[Galaxy morphological classification|Sc]].&lt;ref name=&quot;princeton&quot;/&gt; It is the brightest galaxy in Antlia at an integrated magnitude of 10.6.&lt;ref name=&quot;moore&quot;/&gt; Though nondescript in most amateur telescopes, it presents bright clusters of young stars and many dark dust lanes in photographs.&lt;ref name=&quot;princeton&quot;/&gt;

The [[Antlia Dwarf]], a 14.8&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; [[dwarf spheroidal galaxy]] that belongs to our [[Local Group]] of galaxies. It was discovered only as recently as 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap970423.html |title =Antlia: A New Galactic Neighbor |accessdate =9 April 2012 |date=23 April 1997 |publisher = Astronomy Picture of the Day |last = Nemiroff |first = Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Antlia Cluster]] is a [[galaxy cluster|cluster of galaxies]] located in the [[Hydra-Centaurus Supercluster]]. It is the third nearest to our [[Local Group]] after the [[Virgo Cluster]] and [[Fornax Cluster]].
