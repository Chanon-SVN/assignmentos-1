'''Antimicrobial resistance''', also known as '''antibiotic resistance''' or '''drug resistance''', occurs when microbes survive exposure to [[antimicrobial]] agents because of genetic changes in the microbes.  [[Viruses]], [[fungi]] and [[parasites]] can become resistant but the greatest problems have occurred with [[Pathogenic bacteria|bacteria]]. The World Health Organization states that  antibiotic resistance is &quot;a growing public health threat of broad concern... [that] threatens the achievements of modern medicine.&quot; Bacteria that are resistant to multiple antibiotics are considered ''[[multidrug resistant]]'' (MDR) or ''superbugs''.&lt;ref name=cdcgetsmart&gt;{{cite web|title=Antibiotic Resistance Questions &amp; Answers|url=http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/antibiotic-resistance-faqs.html#e|work=Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA|accessdate=20 March 2013|date=30 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common types of drug-resistant bacteria include MRSA ([[methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus]]), VRSA ([[Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|vancomycin-resistant ''S. aureus'']]), ESBL ([[Beta-lactamase|extended spectrum beta-lactamase]]), VRE ([[Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus|vancomycin-resistant ''Enterococcus'']]) and MRAB ([[Acinetobacter baumannii|multidrug-resistant ''A. baumannii'']]). While mostly [[Hospital-acquired infection|hospital acquired]] some are transmitted in the community. In the simplest cases, drug-resistant organisms may have acquired resistance to first-line antibiotics, thereby necessitating the use of second-line agents. Typically, a first-line agent is selected on the basis of several factors including safety, availability, and cost; a second-line agent is usually broader in spectrum, has a less favourable risk-benefit profile, and is more expensive or, in dire circumstances, may be locally unavailable. In the case of some MDR pathogens, resistance to second- and even third-line antibiotics is sequentially acquired, as quintessentially illustrated by ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' in some [[nosocomial|health care]] settings. Other pathogens, such as ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', also possess a high level of resistance.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Resistance may take the form of a spontaneous or induced genetic [[mutation]], or the acquisition of resistance [[gene]]s from other bacterial species by [[horizontal gene transfer]] via [[bacterial conjugation|conjugation]], [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]], or [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]]. Many antibiotic resistance genes reside on transmissible [[plasmids]], facilitating their transfer. Exposure to an antibiotic [[natural selection|naturally selects]] for the survival of the organisms with the genes for resistance. In this way, a gene for antibiotic resistance may readily spread through an ecosystem of bacteria. Once a bacterium becomes resistant to an antibiotic, it is unable to return to its previous state of vulnerability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Anderson D. | title= Persistence of antibiotic resistant bacteria | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 452–456 | year = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Resistance will be passed on to all of the daughter cells of the resistant microbe. Antibiotic-resistance plasmids frequently contain genes conferring resistance to several different antibiotics. This is not the case for ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', the bacteria that causes [[tuberculosis]], since evidence is lacking for whether these bacteria have plasmids.&lt;ref name=pmid2115217&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zainuddin ZF, Dale JW | title = Does Mycobacterium tuberculosis have plasmids? | journal = Tubercle | volume = 71 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–9 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2115217 | doi = 10.1016/0041-3879(90)90060-l }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also ''M. tuberculosis'' lack the opportunity to interact with other bacteria in order to share plasmids.&lt;ref name=pmid2115217/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Louw GE, Warren RM, Gey van Pittius NC, McEvoy CR, Van Helden PD, Victor TC | title = A Balancing Act: Efflux/Influx in Mycobacterial Drug Resistance | journal = Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy | volume = 53 | issue = 8 | pages = 3181–9 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19451293 | pmc = 2715638 | doi = 10.1128/AAC.01577-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology, history, society and culture--&gt;
Genes for resistance to antibiotics, like the antibiotics themselves, are ancient.{{sfn|D'Costa|King|Kalan|Morar|2011|pp=457–461}} However, the increasing rates of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections seen in clinical practice stems from antibiotic use both within human medicine and [[veterinary medicine]]. Any use of antibiotics can increase [[selective pressure]] in a population of bacteria to allow the resistant bacteria to thrive and the susceptible bacteria to die off. As resistance towards antibiotics becomes more common, a greater need for alternative treatments arises. However, despite a push for new antibiotic therapies, there has been a continued decline in the number of newly approved drugs.{{sfn|Donadio|Maffioli|Monciardini|Sosio|2010|pp=423–430}} Antibiotic resistance therefore poses a significant problem. Antibiotic resistance is a serious and growing problem. A [[World Health Organization]] report released April, 2014 states, &quot;this serious threat is no longer a prediction for the future, it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone, of any age, in any country. Antibiotic resistance–when bacteria change so antibiotics no longer work in people who need them to treat infections–is now a major threat to public health.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;who.int&quot;&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2014/amr-report/en/ &quot;WHO's first global report on antibiotic resistance reveals serious, worldwide threat to public health&quot;] Retrieved 2014-05-02&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CDCinfographicANTIBIORESISTANCE.png|thumb|How antibiotic resistance develops and spreads]]
Although there were low levels of antibiotic-resistant bacteria before the widespread use of antibiotics,{{sfn|Caldwell|Lindberg|2011}} {{sfn|Nelson|2009|p=294}} evolutionary pressure from their use has played a role in the development of multidrug-resistant varieties and the spread of resistance between bacterial species.{{sfn|Hawkey|Jones|2009|pp=i3-i10}} The widespread use of antibiotics both inside and outside medicine is playing a significant role in the emergence of resistant bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goossens H, Ferech M, Vander Stichele R, Elseviers M |title=Outpatient antibiotic use in Europe and association with resistance: a cross-national database study |journal=Lancet |volume=365 |issue=9459 |pages=579–87 |year=2005 |pmid=15708101 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)17907-0 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, antibiotics are sold over the counter without a prescription, which can lead to the creation of resistant strains. Other practices contributing to resistance include [[antibiotic use in livestock]] feed to promote faster growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ferber D | title = Livestock Feed Ban Preserves Drugs' Power | journal = Science | volume = 295 | issue = 5552 | pages = 27–28 | date = 4 January 2002 | pmid = 11778017 | doi = 10.1126/science.295.5552.27a | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mathew&quot;/&gt; Household use of antibacterials in soaps and other products, although not clearly contributing to resistance, is also discouraged (as not being effective at infection control).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=CDC|url=http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/anitbiotic-resistance-faqs.html#j |trans_title = Are antibacterial-containing products (soaps, household cleaners, etc.) better for preventing the spread of infection?

(see [[Healthcare-associated infections]] and [[Infection control]]).

Certain antibiotic classes are more highly associated with colonisation with &quot;superbugs&quot; compared to other antibiotic classes. A superbug, also called multiresistant, is a bacterium that carries several resistance genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/a/antibiotic_resistance.htm |title=Antibiotic resistance |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk for colonisation increases if there is a lack of susceptibility (resistance) of the superbugs to the antibiotic used and high tissue penetration, as well as broad-spectrum activity against &quot;good bacteria&quot;.

In 1952, an experiment conducted by [[Joshua Lederberg|Joshua]] and [[Esther Lederberg]] showed that [[penicillin]]-resistant bacteria existed before penicillin treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/mutations_07|title=Mutations are random|publisher =University of California|accessdate=Aug 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While experimenting at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], Joshua Lederberg and his graduate student Norton Zinder also demonstrated preexistent bacterial resistance to [[streptomycin]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard William Nelson.

Patients taking less than the required dosage or failing to take their doses within the prescribed timing results in decreased concentration of antibiotics in the bloodstream and tissues, and, in turn, exposure of bacteria to suboptimal antibiotic concentrations increases the frequency of antibiotic resistant organisms, however factors within the intensive care unit setting such as mechanical ventilation and multiple underlying diseases also appeared to contribute to bacterial resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thomas JK, Forrest A, Bhavnani SM, Hyatt JM, Cheng A, Ballow CH, Schentag JJ | title = Pharmacodynamic Evaluation of Factors Associated with the Development of Bacterial Resistance in Acutely Ill Patients during Therapy | journal = Antimicrob.

The improper use of antibiotics and therapeutic treatments can often be attributed to the presence of [[structural violence]] in particular regions. Socioeconomic factors such as race and poverty affect the accessibility of and adherence to drug therapy. The efficacy of treatment programs for these drug-resistant strains depends on whether or not programmatic improvements take into account the effects of structural violence.&lt;ref&gt;Farmer, Paul E., Bruce Nizeye, Sara Stulac, and Salmaan Keshavjee. 2006.

The emergence of antibiotic-resistant microorganisms in human medicine is primarily the result of the use of antibiotics in humans, although the use of antibiotics in animals is also partly responsible.&lt;ref&gt;The Resistance Phenomenon in Microbes and Infectious Disease Vectors: Implications for Human Health and Strategies for Containment: Workshop Summary. Institute of Medicine (US) Forum on Emerging Infections; Knobler SL, Lemon SM, Najafi M, et al., editors.

Since the last third of the 20th century, there has been extensive use of antibiotics in [[animal husbandry]]. Some of these drugs are not considered significant for use in humans, because of their lack of either efficacy or purpose in humans (such as the use of [[ionophore]]s in ruminants&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hersom|first=Matt|title=Application of Ionophores in Cattle Diets|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/pdffiles/AN/AN28500.pdf|work=AN285 Department of Animal Sciences|publisher=University of Florida IFAS Extension|accessdate=14 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or because that drug has mostly gone out of use in humans. Others however are used in both animals and humans, including penicillin and some forms of tetracycline.&lt;ref&gt;The Editorial Board of the ''[[New York Times]]'', May 10, 2014, 
 [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/11/opinion/sunday/the-rise-of-antibiotic-resistance.html?ref=opinion&amp;_r=0 The Rise of Antibiotic Resistance]&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, regulation of antibiotic use in food animals has been limited to limiting drug residues in meat, egg, and milk products, rather than by direct concern over the development of antibiotic resistance. This mirrors the primary concerns in human medicine, where, in general, researchers and doctors were more concerned about effective but non-toxic doses of drugs rather than antibiotic resistance.

The resistant bacteria which antibiotic exposure selects in animals can be transmitted to humans via three pathways, those being through the consumption of [[animal product]]s (milk, meat, eggs, etc.), from close or direct contact with animals or other humans, or through the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schneider|first=K|last2=Garrett|first2=L|title=Non-therapeutic Use of Antibiotics in Animal Agriculture, Corresponding Resistance Rates, and What Can be Done About It|url=http://www.cgdev.org/content/article/detail/1422307/|publisher=Center for Global Development|date=June 19, 2009|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first pathway, [[food preservation]] methods can help eliminate, decrease, or prevent the growth of bacteria in some food classes. Evidence for the transfer of antibiotic- resistant microorganisms from animals to humans has been scant, and most evidence shows that pathogens of concern in human populations originated in humans and are maintained there, with rare cases of transference to humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15151237&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hurd HS, Doores S, Hayes D, Mathew A, Maurer J, Silley P, Singer RS, Jones RN | title = Public health consequences of macrolide use in food animals: a deterministic risk assessment | journal = J.

The most accepted classification discriminates therapeutic, prophylactic, metaphylactic, and growth promotion uses of antibiotics.&lt;ref&gt;Joint FAO/OIE/WHO Expert Workshop
on Non-Human Antimicrobial Usage and Antimicrobial Resistance: Scientific assessment [http://www.who.int/foodsafety/publications/micro/en/amr.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  All four patterns select for bacterial resistance, since antibiotic resistance is a natural evolutionary process, but the non-therapeutic uses expose larger number of animals, and therefore of bacteria, for more extended periods, and at lower doses. They therefore greatly increase the cross-section for the evolution of resistance.

The [[World Health Organization]] concluded that inappropriate use of antibiotics in animal husbandry is an underlying contributor to the emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant germs, and that the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in animal feeds should be prohibited, in the absence of risk assessments. Regarding this matter, the [[OIE]] has added to the Terrestrial Animal Health Code a series of guidelines with recommendations to its members for the creation and harmonization of national antimicrobial resistance surveillance and monitoring programs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&amp;L=0&amp;htmfile=chapitre_1.6.7.htm OIE, Terrestrial Animal Health Code]&lt;/ref&gt; monitoring of the quantities of antibiotics used in animal husbandry,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&amp;L=0&amp;htmfile=chapitre_1.6.8.htm OIE,Terrestrial Animal Health Code]&lt;/ref&gt; and recommendations to ensure the proper and prudent use of antibiotic substances. Another guideline introduced in the terrestrial Animal Health Code is the implementation of methodologies that help to establish risk factors associated with this worldwide concern. The OIE concluded that risk assessments should be performed in order to assess, manage and define the possible health risks of antibiotic resistance in human and animal populations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oie.int/index.php?id=169&amp;L=0&amp;htmfile=chapitre_1.6.9.htm OIE,Terrestrial Animal Health Code]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the world, antibiotics are widely used on animals. As in human medicine, antibiotics can often be bought without prescription and veterinary supervision for use on pets and livestock. Bacteria remaining in these animals are likely to be resistant to the antibiotics used, and may be passed into the environment by the excretion and secretion of materials such as milk, feces, urine, saliva, semen, lochia, etc. The actual impact of these resistant germs depends on their specific type and on the animal or organism they henceforth infect. Some germs, such as tetanus, are toxic regardless of their antibiotic-resistant status. (It is useful to remember that antibiotics are not used in treatment of all diseases caused by bacteria. Tetanus, as an example, is prevented by vaccine and is extremely difficult to treat once symptoms appear.)

In 1997, European Union health ministers voted to ban avoparcin in 1997 and four additional antibiotics widely used to promote animal growth in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casewell|first1=M.|title=The European ban on growth-promoting antibiotics and emerging consequences for human and animal health|journal=Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy|date=1 July 2003|volume=52|issue=2|pages=159–161|doi=10.1093/jac/dkg313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation banning the use of antibiotics in European feed, with the exception of two antibiotics in poultry feeds, became effective in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Castanon JI | title = History of the use of antibiotic as growth promoters in European poultry feeds | journal = Poult.

===United States===
In the United States, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) collect data on antibiotic use in animals and humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;gao&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/330/323097.html|title=GAO-11-801, Antibiotic Resistance: Agencies Have Made Limited Progress Addressing Antibiotic Use in Animals|publisher=gao.gov|accessdate=2014-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In research studies, occasional animal-to-human spread of drug-resistant organisms has been demonstrated. Antibiotics and other drugs are used in U.S. animal feed to promote animal productivity.&lt;ref name=&quot;mathew&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mathew AG, Cissell R, Liamthong S | title = Antibiotic resistance in bacteria associated with food animals: a United States perspective of livestock production | journal = Foodborne Pathog.

In general, animals that appear ill are not permitted to be slaughtered for human consumption in the United States.

Growing U.S. consumer concern about using antibiotics in animal feed has led to a niche market of &quot;antibiotic-free&quot; animal products, but this small market is unlikely to change entrenched, industry-wide practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Baker R | title = Health management with reduced antibiotic use&amp;nbsp;— the U.S. experience | journal = Anim. Biotechnol. | volume = 17 | issue = 2 | pages = 195–205 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17127530 | doi = 10.1080/10495390600962274 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] estimated that greater than 70% of the antibiotics used in the U.S. are given to food animals (for example, chickens, pigs, and cattle), in the absence of disease.&lt;ref name=TheRealNews-2014-05-18/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ucsusa.org/food_and_environment/antibiotics_and_food/hogging-it-estimates-of-antimicrobial-abuse-in-livestock.html|title= Executive summary from the UCS report &quot;Hogging It: Estimates of Antimicrobial Abuse in Livestock&quot;|publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists|date=January 2001|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amounts given are termed &quot;sub-therapeutic&quot;, i.e., insufficient to combat disease. Despite no diagnosis of disease, the administration of these drugs (most of which are not significant to human medicine) results in decreased mortality and morbidity and increased growth in the animals so treated. It is theorized that sub-therapeutic dosages kills some, but not all, of the bacterial organisms in the animal — likely leaving those that are naturally antibiotic-resistant{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}. Studies have shown, however, that, in essence, the overall population levels of bacteria are unchanged; only the mix of bacteria is affected.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

The actual mechanism by which sub-therapeutic antibiotic feed additives serve as growth promoters is thus unclear. Some people have speculated that animals and fowl may have sub-clinical infections, which would be cured by low levels of antibiotics in feed, thereby allowing the creatures to thrive. No convincing evidence has been advanced for this theory, and the bacterial load in an animal is essentially unchanged by use of antibiotic feed additives. The mechanism of growth promotion is therefore probably something other than &quot;killing off the bad bugs.&quot;

In 2000, the FDA announced their intention to revoke approval of [[fluoroquinolone]] use in poultry production because of substantial evidence linking it to the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant ''[[Campylobacter]]'' infections in humans. Legal challenges from the food animal and pharmaceutical industries delayed the final decision to do so until 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson-2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nelson JM, Chiller TM, Powers JH, Angulo FJ | title = Fluoroquinolone-resistant Campylobacter species and the withdrawal of fluoroquinolones from use in poultry: a public health success story | journal = Clin Infect Dis | volume = 44 | issue = 7 | pages = 977–80 | date = Apr 2007 | pmid = 17342653 | doi = 10.1086/512369 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluroquinolones have been banned from extra-label use in food animals in the USA since 2007. However, they remain widely used in companion and exotic animals.

In 2001, ''National Hog Farmer'' magazine warned U.S. producers that ''C. difficile'' &quot;is sweeping the industry, killing many piglets&quot; (Neutkens D; &quot;New Clostridium Claiming Baby Pigs&quot;). In 2006, a study by the USDA's National Animal Health Monitoring System further investigated the prevalence of ''C. difficile'' in hog farms. The study, which covered hog farms of a size typical of those producing 94% of US swine, found the prevalence of ''C. difficile'' &quot;relatively low (11.4%)&quot; and that there was no difference in region or in size of farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=APHIS|title=Clostridium difficile on U.S. Swine Operations|url=http://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/nahms/swine/downloads/swine2006/Swine2006_is_Cdiff.pdf|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human infection with ''C. difficile'' (either drug-resistant or not) is most commonly associated with the use of strong antibiotics in hospitalized humans, and is not associated with humans in contact with farm animals.

During 2007, two federal bills (S. 549&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s110-549|title=US Senate Bill S. 549: Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2007|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and H.R. 962&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-962 |title=Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act of 2007|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;) aimed at phasing out &quot;nontherapeutic&quot; antibiotics in U.S. food animal production. The Senate bill, introduced by Sen. [[Ted Kennedy|Edward &quot;Ted&quot; Kennedy]], died. The House bill, introduced by Rep. [[Louise Slaughter]], died after being referred to Committee.

In the United States, the FDA first determined in 1977 that there is evidence of emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains in livestock. The long-established practice of permitting OTC sales of antibiotics (including penicillin and other drugs) to lay animal owners for administration to their own animals nonetheless continued in all states. In March 2012, the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]], ruling in an action brought by the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] and others, ordered the FDA to revoke approvals for the use of antibiotics in livestock that violated FDA regulations.&lt;ref name=MPFDA&gt;{{cite news|title=FDA Told to Move on Antibiotic Use in Livestock|url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/PublicHealthPolicy/FDAGeneral/31792|accessdate=March 24, 2012|newspaper=MedPage Today|date=March 23, 2012|author=John Gever}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 11, 2012 the FDA announced a voluntary program to phase out unsupervised use of drugs as feed additives and convert approved over-the-counter uses for antibiotics to prescription use only, requiring veterinarian supervision of their use and a prescription.&lt;ref name=NYTPrescription&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Tightens Rules on Antibiotics Use for Livestock|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/12/us/antibiotics-for-livestock-will-require-prescription-fda-says.html|accessdate=April 12, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 11, 2012|author=Gardiner Harris}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FDAFAQ&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA's Strategy on Antimicrobial Resistance&amp;nbsp;— Questions and Answers|url=http://www.fda.gov/AnimalVeterinary/GuidanceComplianceEnforcement/GuidanceforIndustry/ucm216939.htm|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=April 12, 2012|date=April 11, 2012|quote=“Judicious use” is using an antimicrobial drug appropriately and only when necessary; Based on a thorough review of the available scientific information, FDA recommends that use of medically important antimicrobial drugs in food-producing animals be limited to situations where the use of these drugs is necessary for ensuring animal health, and their use includes veterinary oversight or consultation.

==Environmental impact==
Antibiotics have been polluting the environment since their introduction through human waste (medication, farming), animals, and the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martinez, J. L. 2012 pp. 151- 171&quot;&gt;Martinez, J. L., &amp; Olivares, J. (2012). Envrironmental Pollution By Antibiotic Resistance Genes. In P. L. Keen, &amp; M. H. Montforts, Antimicrobial Resistance in the Environment (pp. 151- 171). Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; Along with antibiotic waste, resistant bacteria follow, thus introducing antibiotic-resistant bacteria into the environment. As bacteria replicate quickly, the resistant bacteria that enter the environment replicate their resistance genes as they continue to divide. In addition, bacteria carrying resistance genes have the ability to spread those genes to other species via horizontal gene transfer. Therefore, even if the specific antibiotic is no longer introduced into the environment, antibiotic-resistance genes will persist through the bacteria that have since replicated without continuous exposure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Martinez, J. L. 2012 pp. 151- 171&quot;/&gt;

A study the [[Poudre River]] ([[Colorado]], [[United States]]) implicated wastewater treatment plants, as well as animal-feeding operations in the dispersal of antibiotic-resistance genes into the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Pruden, A., &amp; Arabi, M. (2012). Quantifying Anthropogenic Impacts on Environmental Reservoirs of Antibiotic Resistance. In P. L. Keen, &amp; M. H. Montforts, Antimicrobial Resistance in the Environment (pp. 173-202). Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; This research was done using molecular signatures in order to determine the sources, and the location at the Poudre River was chosen due to lack of other anthropogenic influences upstream. The study indicates that monitoring of antibiotic-resistance genes may be useful in determining not only the point of origin of their release but also how these genes persist in the environment. In addition, studying physical and chemical methods of treatment may alleviate pressure of antibiotic-resistance genes in the environment, and thus their entry back into human contact.

The top section represents a population of bacteria before exposure to an antibiotic. The middle section shows the population directly after exposure, the phase in which selection took place.

[[File:mecA Resistance.svg|thumb|right|Diagram depicting antibiotic resistance through alteration of the antibiotic's target site, modeled after MRSA's resistance to penicillin. Beta-lactam antibiotics permanently inactivate [[Penicillin-binding protein|PBP enzymes]], which are essential for bacterial life, by permanently binding to their active sites. [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]], however, expresses a PBP that does not allow the antibiotic into its active site.]]

The four main mechanisms by which microorganisms exhibit resistance to antimicrobials are:
#Drug inactivation or modification: for example, enzymatic deactivation of [[Penicillin|''penicillin'' G]] in some penicillin-resistant bacteria through the production of [[Beta-lactamases|β-lactamases]]. Most commonly, the protective enzymes produced by the bacterial cell will add an acetyl or phosphate group to a specific site on the antibiotic, which will reduce its ability to bind to the bacterial ribosomes and disrupt protein synthesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Criswell, Daniel 2004&quot;&gt;[Criswell, Daniel. &quot;The &quot;Evolution&quot; of Antibiotic Resistance.&quot; Institute for Creation Research. N.p., 2004. Web. 28 Oct. 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;
#Alteration of target site: for example, alteration of [[Penicillin binding protein|PBP]]—the binding target site of penicillins—in [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]] and other penicillin-resistant bacteria. Another protective mechanism found among bacterial species is ribosomal protection proteins. These proteins protect the bacterial cell from antibiotics that target the cell’s ribosomes to inhibit protein synthesis. The mechanism involves the binding of the ribosomal protection proteins to the ribosomes of the bacterial cell, which in turn changes its conformational shape. This allows the ribosomes to continue synthesizing proteins essential to the cell while preventing antibiotics from binding to the ribosome to inhibit protein synthesis. 
#Alteration of metabolic pathway: for example, some [[sulfa drugs|sulfonamide]]-resistant bacteria do not require [[para-aminobenzoic acid]] (PABA), an important precursor for the synthesis of [[folic acid]] and [[nucleic acids]] in bacteria inhibited by sulfonamides, instead, like mammalian cells, they turn to using preformed folic acid.
#Reduced drug accumulation: by decreasing drug [[Semipermeable membrane|permeability]] or increasing active [[efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] (pumping out) of the drugs across the cell surface&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Li XZ, Nikaido H | title = Efflux-Mediated Drug Resistance in Bacteria: an Update | journal = Drug | volume = 69 | issue = 12 | pages = 1555–623 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19678712 | pmc = 2847397 | doi = 10.2165/11317030-000000000-00000 | ref = harv | last2 = Nikadio | first2 = H }}&lt;/ref&gt; These specialized pumps can be found within the cellular membrane of certain bacterial species and are used to pump antibiotics out of the cell before they are able to do any damage. These efflux pumps are often activated by a specific substrate associated with an antibiotic.&lt;ref&gt;[RI Aminov, RI Mackie. Evolution and ecology of antibiotic resistance genes. Microbiology Letters. 8 May 2007. DOI: 10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00757.x]&lt;/ref&gt;

Antibiotic resistance can be a result of [[horizontal gene transfer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ochiai|first= K.|last2= Yamanaka|first2= T |last3=Kimura |first3=K |last4=Sawada|first4= O |year=1959|title= Inheritance of drug resistance (and its transfer) between Shigella strains and Between Shigella and E.coli strains|journal= Hihon Iji Shimpor, |page= 1861|volume= 34|language= Japanese|ref=harv}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and also of unlinked point mutations in the [[pathogen]] [[genome]] at a rate of about 1 in 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; per chromosomal replication. Mutations are rare but the fact that bacteria reproduce at such a high rate allows for the effect to be significant. A mutation may produce a change in the binding site of the antibiotic, which may allow the site to continue proper functioning in the presence of the antibiotic or prevent the binding of the antibiotic to the site altogether. Research has shown the bacterial protein LexA may play a key role in the acquisition of bacterial mutations giving resistance to quinolones and rifampicin. DNA damage induces the SOS gene repressor LexA to undergo autoproteolytic activity. This includes the transcription of genes encoding Pol II, Pol IV, and Pol V, which are three nonessential DNA polymerases that are required for mutation in response to DNA damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cirz RT, Chin JK, Andes DR, de Crécy-Lagard V, Craig WA, Romesberg FE | title = Inhibition of Mutation and Combating the Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance | journal = PLoS Biol. | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | pages = e176 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15869329 | pmc = 1088971 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030176 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; The antibiotic action against the pathogen can be seen as an environmental pressure. Those bacteria with a mutation that allows them to survive live to reproduce. They then pass this trait to their offspring, which leads to the evolution of a fully resistant colony. Although these chromosomal mutations may seem to benefit the bacteria by providing antibiotic resistance, they also confer a cost of fitness. For example, a ribosomal mutation may protect a bacterial cell by changing the binding site of an antibiotic but it will also slow the process of protein synthesis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Criswell, Daniel 2004&quot;/&gt; Additionally, a particular study specifically compared the overall fitness of antibiotic resistant strains of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium to their drug-sensitive revertants. They observed a reduced overall fitness in the antibiotic resistant strains, especially in growth rate.&lt;ref&gt;[BR Levin, V Perrot, Nina Walker. Compensatory Mutations, Antibiotic Resistance and the Population Genetics of Adaptive Evolution in Bacteria. Genetics March 1, 2000 vol. 154 no. 3 985-997.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three known mechanisms of [[fluoroquinolone]] resistance. Some types of [[Efflux (microbiology)|efflux]] pumps can act to decrease intracellular [[quinolone]] concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Morita Y, Kodama K, Shiota S, Mine T, Kataoka A, Mizushima T, Tsuchiya T | title = NorM, a Putative Multidrug Efflux Protein, of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Its Homolog in Escherichia coli | journal = Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. | volume = 42 | issue = 7 | pages = 1778–82 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9661020 | pmc = 105682 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Gram-negative bacteria, plasmid-mediated resistance genes produce proteins that can bind to [[DNA gyrase]], protecting it from the action of quinolones. Finally, mutations at key sites in DNA gyrase or [[topoisomerase IV]] can decrease their binding affinity to quinolones, decreasing the drug's effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Robicsek A, Jacoby GA, Hooper DC | title = The worldwide emergence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance | journal = Lancet Infect Dis | volume = 6 | issue = 10 | pages = 629–40 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17008172 | doi = 10.1016/S1473-3099(06)70599-0 | ref = harv | last3 = Hooper | last2 = Jacoby | first2 = GA | first3 = DC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antibiotic resistance can also be introduced artificially into a microorganism through laboratory protocols, sometimes used as a [[selectable marker]] to examine the mechanisms of gene transfer or to identify individuals that absorbed a piece of DNA that included the resistance gene and another gene of interest. A recent study demonstrated that the extent of [[horizontal gene transfer]] among ''Staphylococcus'' is much greater than previously expected—and encompasses genes with functions beyond antibiotic resistance and virulence, and beyond genes residing within the [[mobile genetic elements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chan CX, Beiko RG, Ragan MA | title = Lateral Transfer of Genes and Gene Fragments in Staphylococcus Extends beyond Mobile Elements | journal = J Bacteriol | volume = 193 | issue = 15 | pages = 3964–3977 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21622749 | pmc = 3147504 | doi = 10.1128/JB.01524-10 | ref = harv | last3 = Ragan | last2 = Beiko | first2 = RG | first3 = MA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a long time, it has been thought that, for a microorganism to become resistant to an antibiotic, it must be in a large population. However, recent findings show that there is no necessity of large populations of bacteria for the appearance of antibiotic resistance. We know now that small populations of E.coli in an antibiotic gradient can become resistant. Any heterogeneous environment with respect to nutrient and antibiotic gradients may facilitate the development of antibiotic resistance in small bacterial populations and this is also true for the human body. Researchers hypothesize that the mechanism of resistance development is based on four SNP mutations in the genome of E.coli produced by the gradient of antibiotic. These mutations confer the bacteria emergence of antibiotic resistance.

A common misconception is that a person can become resistant to certain antibiotics. It is a strain of microorganism that can become resistant, not a person's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/getsmart/antibiotic-use/antibiotic-resistance-faqs.html |title=CDC: Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work |publisher=Cdc.gov |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tufts.edu/med/apua/about_issue/societal_prob.shtml |title=APUA: General Background: Antibiotic Resistance, A Societal Problem |publisher=Tufts.edu |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resistant pathogens==

===''Staphylococcus aureus''===
{{Main|Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus}}
''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' (colloquially known as &quot;Staph aureus&quot; or a &quot;Staph infection&quot;) is one of the major resistant pathogens. Found on the [[mucous membranes]] and the [[human skin]] of around a third of the population, it is extremely adaptable to antibiotic pressure. It was one of the earlier bacteria in which [[penicillin]] resistance was found—in 1947, just four years after the drug started being mass-produced. [[Methicillin]] was then the antibiotic of choice, but has since been replaced by [[oxacillin]] due to significant kidney toxicity. [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA) was first detected in Britain in 1961, and is now &quot;quite common&quot; in hospitals. MRSA was responsible for 37% of fatal cases of [[sepsis]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] in 1999, up from 4% in 1991. Half of all ''S. aureus'' infections in the [[United States|US]] are resistant to penicillin, methicillin, [[tetracycline]] and [[erythromycin]].

This left [[vancomycin]] as the only effective agent available at the time. However, strains with intermediate (4-8&amp;nbsp;μg/ml) levels of resistance, termed glycopeptide-intermediate ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (GISA) or vancomycin-intermediate ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (VISA), began appearing in the late 1990s. The first identified case was in Japan in 1996, and strains have since been found in hospitals in England, France and the US. The first documented strain with complete (&gt;16&amp;nbsp;μg/ml) resistance to vancomycin, termed [[Vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|vancomycin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (VRSA) appeared in the United States in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bozdogan B, Esel D, Whitener C, Browne FA, Appelbaum PC | title = Antibacterial susceptibility of a vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain isolated at the Hershey Medical Center | journal = Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy | volume = 52 | issue = 5 | pages = 864–868 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14563898 | doi = 10.1093/jac/dkg457 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2011, a variant of vancomycin has been tested that binds to the lactate variation and also binds well to the original target, thus reinstating potent antimicrobial activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Xie J, Pierce JG, James RC, Okano A, Boger DL | title = A Redesigned Vancomycin Engineered for Dual d-Ala-d-Ala and d-Ala-d-Lac Binding Exhibits Potent Antimicrobial Activity Against Vancomycin-Resistant Bacteria | journal = J.

A new class of antibiotics, [[Linezolid|oxazolidinones]], became available in the 1990s, and the first commercially available oxazolidinone, [[linezolid]], is comparable to vancomycin in effectiveness against MRSA. Linezolid-resistance in ''S. aureus'' was reported in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tsiodras S, Gold HS, Sakoulas G, Eliopoulos GM, Wennersten C, Venkataraman L, Moellering RC, Ferraro MJ | title = Linezolid resistance in a clinical isolate of Staphylococcus aureus | journal = The Lancet | volume = 358 | issue = 9277 | pages = 207–208 | pmid = 11476839 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(01)05410-1 | date=July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) has now emerged as an epidemic that is responsible for rapidly progressive, fatal diseases, including necrotizing pneumonia, severe [[sepsis]], and [[necrotizing fasciitis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17146447&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Boyle-Vavra S, Daum RS | title = Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: the role of Panton-Valentine leukocidin | journal = Lab.

The [[epidemiology]] of infections caused by MRSA is rapidly changing. In the past 10&amp;nbsp;years{{when|date=October 2012}}, infections caused by this organism have emerged in the community. The two MRSA clones in the United States most closely associated with community outbreaks, [[USA400]] (MW2 strain, ST1 lineage) and [[USA300]], often contain [[Panton-Valentine leukocidin]] (PVL) genes and, more frequently, have been associated with skin and soft tissue infections. Outbreaks of CA-MRSA infections have been reported in correctional facilities, among athletic teams, among military recruits, in newborn nurseries, and among men that have sex with men. CA-MRSA infections now appear endemic in many urban regions and cause most CA-''S. aureus'' infections.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17479885&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Maree CL, Daum RS, Boyle-Vavra S, Matayoshi K, Miller LG | title = Community-associated Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus Isolates and Healthcare-Associated Infections | journal = Emerging Infect.

===''Streptococcus'' and ''Enterococcus''===
''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' (Group A ''Streptococcus'': GAS) infections can usually be treated with many different antibiotics. Early treatment may reduce the risk of death from invasive group A streptococcal disease. However, even the best medical care does not prevent death in every case. For those with very severe illness, supportive care in an intensive-care unit may be needed. For persons with necrotizing fasciitis, surgery often is needed to remove damaged tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=CDCP |title=Group A Streptococcal (GAS) Disease (strep throat, necrotizing fasciitis, impetigo) -- Frequently Asked Questions |url=http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/groupastreptococcal_g.htm |date=2005-10-11 |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |accessdate=2007-12-11|ref=harv| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071219224215/http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dbmd/diseaseinfo/groupastreptococcal_g.htm| archivedate= 19 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strains of ''S. pyogenes'' resistant to [[macrolide]] antibiotics have emerged; however, all strains remain uniformly susceptible to [[penicillin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15109426&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Albrich WC, Monnet DL, Harbarth S | title = Antibiotic selection pressure and resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes | journal = Emerging Infect.

Resistance of ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' to penicillin and other beta-lactams is increasing worldwide. The major mechanism of resistance involves the introduction of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. Selective pressure is thought to play an important role, and use of beta-lactam antibiotics has been implicated as a risk factor for infection and colonization. ''S. pneumoniae'' is responsible for [[pneumonia]], [[bacteremia]], [[otitis media]], [[meningitis]], [[sinusitis]], [[peritonitis]] and [[arthritis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15109426&quot;/&gt;

===''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''===
''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' is a highly prevalent [[opportunistic pathogen]]. One of the most worrisome characteristics of ''P. aeruginosa'' is its low antibiotic susceptibility, which is attributable to a concerted action of [[efflux (microbiology)|multidrug efflux pumps]] with chromosomally encoded antibiotic resistance genes (for example, ''mexAB-oprM'', ''mexXY'', etc.) and the low permeability of the bacterial cellular envelopes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poole2004&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Poole K | title = Efflux-mediated multiresistance in Gram-negative bacteria | journal = Clinical Microbiology and Infection | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–26 | year = 2004 | pmid = 14706082 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-0691.2004.00763.x | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' has the ability to produce 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines (HAQs) and it has been found that HAQs have prooxidant effects, and overexpressing modestly increased susceptibility to antibiotics.
The study experimented with the ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'' biofilms and found that a disruption of relA and spoT genes produced an inactivation of the Stringent response (SR) in cells with nutrient limitation, which provides cells be more susceptible to antibiotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nguyen D, Joshi-Datar A, Lepine F, Bauerle E, Olakanmi O, Beer K, McKay G, Siehnel R, Schafhauser J, Wang Y, Britigan BE, Singh PK | title = Active Starvation Responses Mediate Antibiotic Tolerance in Biofilms and Nutrient-Limited Bacteria | journal = Science | volume = 334 | issue = 6058 | pages = 982–6 | year = 2011 | pmid = 22096200 | doi = 10.1126/science.1211037 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some research suggests the overuse of antibiotics in the raising of livestock is contributing to outbreaks of bacterial infections such as C. difficile.[16]

Antibiotics, especially those with a broad activity spectrum (such as clindamycin) disrupt normal intestinal flora. This can lead to an overgrowth of C. difficile, which flourishes under these conditions. Pseudomembranous colitis can follow, creating generalized inflammation of the colon and the development of &quot;pseudomembrane&quot;, a viscous collection of inflammatory cells, fibrin, and necrotic cells.[4] [[Clindamycin]]-resistant ''C. difficile'' was reported as the causative agent of large outbreaks of diarrheal disease in hospitals in New York, Arizona, Florida and Massachusetts between 1989 and 1992.&lt;ref name=Johnson1999&gt;{{cite journal | author = Johnson S, Samore MH, Farrow KA, Killgore GE, Tenover FC, Lyras D, Rood JI, DeGirolami P, Baltch AL, Rafferty ME, Pear SM, Gerding DN | title = Epidemics of diarrhea caused by a clindamycin-resistant strain of ''Clostridium difficile'' in four hospitals | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 341 | issue = 23 | pages = 1645–1651 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10572152 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199911253412203 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographically dispersed outbreaks of ''C. difficile'' strains resistant to [[fluoroquinolone]] antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, were also reported in North America in 2005.&lt;ref name=Loo_2005&gt;{{cite journal | author = Loo VG, Poirier L, Miller MA, Oughton M, Libman MD, Michaud S, Bourgault AM, Nguyen T, Frenette C, Kelly M, Vibien A, Brassard P, Fenn S, Dewar K, Hudson TJ, Horn R, René P, Monczak Y, Dascal A | title = A predominantly clonal multi-institutional outbreak of Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea with high morbidity and mortality | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 353 | issue = 23 | pages = 2442–9 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16322602 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa051639 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Salmonella'' and ''E. coli''===
Infection with ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Salmonella]]'' can result from the consumption of contaminated food and water. Both of these bacteria are well known for causing nosocomial (hospital-linked) infections, and often, these strains found in hospitals are antibiotic resistant due to adaptations to wide spread antibiotic use.&lt;ref name=Davies2010&gt;{{cite journal | author = Davies J, Davies D | title = Origins and Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance | journal = Microbiol Mol Biol Rev | volume = 74 | issue = 3 | pages = 417–433 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20805405 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.00016-10 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; When both bacteria are spread, serious health conditions arise. Many people are hospitalized each year after becoming infected, with some dying as a result. Since 1993, some strains of  ''E. coli'' have become resistant to multiple types of [[quinolones|fluoroquinolone antibiotics]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Although mutation alone plays a huge role in the development of antibiotic resistance, there was a study done recently that found that high survival rates after exposure to antibiotics could not be accounted for by mutation alone.&lt;ref name=Adam2008&gt;{{cite journal | author = Adam M, Murali B, Glenn N, Potter S | title = Epigenetic inheritance based evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria | journal = BMC Evol | volume = 8 | pages = 1-12 | year = 2008 |  ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study focused specifically on Escherichia coli’s development of resistance to three antibiotic drugs: ampicillin, tetracycline, and nalidixic acid. At the conclusion of the study, these researchers found that some antibiotic resistance in E. coli developed due to epigenetic inheritance rather than by direct inheritance of a mutated gene. This was further supported by their data showing that reversion back to antibiotic sensitivity was relatively common as well. This could only be explained by epigenetics.&lt;ref name=Adam2008&gt;{{cite journal | author = Adam M, Murali B, Glenn N, Potter S | title = Epigenetic inheritance based evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria | journal = BMC Evol | volume = 8 | pages = 1-12 | year = 2008 |  ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Epigenetics is a type of inheritance where gene expression is altered rather than the genetic code itself. There are many modes by which this alteration of gene expression can occur. This includes methylation of DNA and histone modification; however, the important idea is that both inheritance of random mutations and epigenetic markers can result in the expression of antibiotic resistance genes.&lt;ref name=Adam2008&gt;{{cite journal | author = Adam M, Murali B, Glenn N, Potter S | title = Epigenetic inheritance based evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria | journal = BMC Evol | volume = 8 | pages = 1-12 | year = 2008 |  ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

TB was considered one of the most prevalent diseases, and did not have a cure until the discovery of [[Streptomycin]] by [[Selman Waksman]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Herzog H | title = History of Tuberculosis | journal = Respiration | volume = 65 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–15 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9523361 | doi = 10.1159/000029220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the bacteria soon developed resistance. Since then, drugs such as [[isoniazid]] and [[rifampin]] have been used. M. tuberculosis develops resistance to drugs by spontaneous mutations in its genomes. Resistance to one drug is common, and this is why treatment is usually done with more than one drug. [[Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis|Extensively Drug-Resistant TB]] (XDR TB) is TB that is also resistant to the second line of drugs.&lt;ref name=&quot;journals.lww.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ddmec.2010.09.006 |title=Transmission of MDR tuberculosis |year=2010 |last1=Gao |first1=Qian |last2=Li |first2=Xia |journal=Drug Discovery Today: Disease Mechanisms |volume=7 |pages=e61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]] is a sexually transmitted pathogen that can cause pelvic pain, pain on urination, penile, and vaginal discharge, as well as systemic symptoms in human infection.

Treatment with [[penicillin]] in the 1940s proved helpful, but by the 1970s resistant strains predominated. Resistance to penicillin has developed through two mechanisms: chomasomally mediated resistance (CMRNG) and penicillinase-mediated resistance (PPNG). CMRNG involves stepwise mutation of penA, which codes for the penicilin-binding protein (PBP-2); mtr, which encodes an efflux pump to remove penicilin from the cell; and penB, which encodes the bacterial cell wall porins. PPNG involves the acquisition of a plasmid-borne beta-lactamase.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tapsall 2001&quot;&gt;Tapsall (2001) Antimicrobial resistance in ''Niesseria gonorrhoeae''.

[[quinolones|Fluoroquinolones]] were a useful next-line treatment until resistance was achieved through efflux pumps and mutations to the gyrA gene, which encodes [[DNA gyrase]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tapsall 2001&quot;/&gt; Third-generation cephalosporins have been used to treat gonorrhoea since 2007, although resistant strains have emerged. Strains of Neisseria gonorrhoea have also been found to be resistant to [[tetracyclines]] and [[aminoglycosides]]. Neisseria gonorrheoea has a high affinity for horizontal gene transfer, and as a result, the existence of any strain resistant to a given drug could spread easily across strains.
Today, injectable ceftriaxone is used, sometimes in combination with azithromycin or doxycycline.&lt;ref name=Japan10&gt;{{cite journal | author = Deguchi T, Nakane K, Yasuda M, Maeda S | title = Emergence and spread of drug resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae | journal = J.

=== World Health Organization recommendations ===
An April 30, 2014, report by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] makes the following recommendations for how to tackle antibiotic resistance:&lt;ref name=&quot;who.int&quot;/&gt;
* People can help tackle resistance by:
** using antibiotics only when prescribed by a doctor;

===Decreasing antibiotic use===
Excessive antibiotic use has become one of the top contributors to the development of antibiotic resistance. Since the beginning of the antibiotic era, antibiotics have been used to treat a wide range of disease and illness.&lt;ref name=Andersson2011&gt;{{cite journal | author = Andersson D, Hughes D | title = Persistence of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations | journal = FEMS Microbiol Rev | volume = 35 | pages = 901–911 | year = 2011 |  ref = harv | doi=10.1111/j.1574-6976.2011.00289.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overuse of antibiotics has become the primary cause rising levels of antibiotic resistance. The main problem is that doctors are willing to prescribe antibiotics to ill-informed patients who believe that antibiotics can cure nearly all illnesses, including viral infections like the common cold. In fact, in a recent analysis of drug prescriptions, it was found that 35.7% of patients with a cold or an upper respiratory infection (both viral in origin) were given prescriptions for antibiotics.&lt;ref name=Gilberg2003&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gilberg K, Laouri M, Wade S, and Isonaka S | title = Analysis of medication use patterns: apparent overuse of antibiotics and underuse of prescription drugs for asthma, depression, and CHF | journal = J Managed Care Pharm | volume = 9 | pages = 232–237 | year = 2003 |  ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; These prescriptions accomplished nothing other than increase the risk for further evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria.

Rational use of [[antibiotics]] may reduce the chances of development of opportunistic infection by antibiotic-resistant bacteria due to [[dysbacteriosis]]. The immune systems will cure minor bacterial infections on its own. It is also important to note that antibiotics will not cure viral infections such as colds and the flu, and taking an antibiotic unnecessarily to treat a viral infection can lead to increased resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/evolution/library/10/4/l_104_03.html|work=PBS.org|publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation and Clear Blue Sky Productions, Inc.|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unclear if rapid viral testing affects antibiotic use in children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Doan|first1=Q|last2=Enarson|first2=P|last3=Kissoon|first3=N|last4=Klassen|first4=TP|last5=Johnson|first5=DW|title=Rapid viral diagnosis for acute febrile respiratory illness in children in the Emergency Department.|journal=The Cochrane database of systematic reviews|date=Sep 15, 2014|volume=9|pages=CD006452|pmid=25222468|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD006452.pub4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vaccine]]s do not have the problem of resistance because a vaccine enhances the body's immune system, whereas an antibiotic operates separately from the body's normal defenses. Nevertheless, new strains that escape immunity induced by vaccines may [[Evolution|evolve]]; for example, an updated [[influenza vaccine]] is needed each year.

===Phage therapy===
[[Phage therapy]], an approach that has been extensively researched and used as a therapeutic agent for over 60&amp;nbsp;years, especially in the [[Soviet Union]], represents a potentially significant but currently underdeveloped approach to the treatment of bacterial disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid22833738&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Keen EC | title = Phage therapy: concept to cure | journal = Front Microbiol | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 238 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22833738 | pmc = 3400130 | doi = 10.3389/fmicb.2012.00238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Phage therapy was widely used in the United States until the discovery of antibiotics, in the early 1940s. Bacteriophages or &quot;phages&quot; are viruses that invade bacterial cells and, in the case of lytic phages, disrupt bacterial metabolism and cause the bacterium to [[lysis|lyse]]. Phage therapy is the therapeutic use of lytic [[bacteriophages]] to treat [[pathogenic]] bacterial infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Phages and their application against drug-resistant bacteria| journal=J. Chem. Technol. Biotechnol.| year=2001| volume=76| pages=689–699| first=N |last=Chanishvili|first2= T |last2=Chanishvili|first3= M. |last3=Tediashvili|first4= P.A. |last4=Barrow | doi=10.1002/jctb.438| issue=7 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bacteriophage therapy is a potentially important alternative to antibiotics in the current era of multidrug-resistant pathogens. A review of studies that dealt with the therapeutic use of phages from 1966 to 1996 and few latest ongoing phage therapy projects via internet showed: Phages were used topically, orally or systemically in Polish and Soviet studies. The success rate found in these studies was 80–95%, with few gastrointestinal or allergic side-effects. British studies also demonstrated significant efficacy of phages against ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Acinetobacter]]'' spp., ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' spp., and ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''. US studies dealt with improving the bioavailability of phage. Phage therapy may prove as an important alternative to antibiotics for treating multidrug-resistant pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chowdhry S, Pandhi D, Vidhani S, Bhalla P, Reddy BS | title = Bacteriophage therapy: an alternative to conventional antibiotics | journal = J Assoc Physicians India | volume = 51 | issue = 8 | pages = 593–6 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12194741 | doi = 10.1258/095646202760159701 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Probiotics===
By definition, [[probiotics]] are “A live microbial feed supplement which beneficially affects the host animal by improving its intestinal microbial balance” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fuller R. | title = History and Development of Probiotics | journal = Probiotics: The Scientific Basis | pages = 1–8 | year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment works by ingesting an encapsulated pill filled with helpful microbes. Once these organisms reach the gut, they replenish the beneficial bacteria that were wiped out due to antibiotic use. The microbes also apply niche competition to the harmful microbes trying to colonize the body, helping to prevent the occurrence of an infection.

===Fecal Transplants===
A [[stool transplant]] works by taking the feces from a healthy individual and inserting it into an individual who has an infection. There are three methods in which this treatment can be administered. The mixture can be applied to the top of the small intestine by insertion of a tube through the mouth or nose, applied in the colon during a colonoscopy, or by using an enema in the lower end of the colon. This allows for healthy bacteria to be reintroduced to the gut microbiome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =Van den Abbeele P, Verstraete W, et. al | title = Prebiotics, faecal transplants and microbial network units to stimulate biodiversity of the human gut microbiome | journal = Microbial Technology | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 335–340 | year=2013 | doi=10.1111/1751-7915.12049}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is another method of introducing natural, beneficial bacteria back into the body and eradicating the harmful microbes.

==Research==

===Decreasing antibiotic use===
While theoretically promising, antistaphylococcal vaccines have shown limited efficacy, because of immunological variation between ''Staphylococcus'' species, and the limited duration of effectiveness of the antibodies produced. Development and testing of more effective vaccines is underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homesteadschools.com/nursing/courses/Immunity/Chapter05.html |title=Immunity, Infectious Diseases,and Pandemics—What You Can Do |publisher=HomesteadSchools.com |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ([[CSIRO]]), realizing the need for the reduction of antibiotic use, has been working on two alternatives. One alternative is to prevent diseases by adding [[cytokine]]s instead of antibiotics to animal feed.&lt;ref name=&quot;blogspot1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biotechnolo.blogspot.com/2009_12_01_archive.html |title=Science,Technology,genetics,research on biotechnology: December 2009 |publisher=Biotechnolo.blogspot.com |accessdate=2013-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These proteins are made in the animal body &quot;naturally&quot; after a disease and are not antibiotics, so they do not contribute to the problem of antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, studies on using cytokines have shown they also enhance the growth of animals like the antibiotics now used, but without the drawbacks of antibiotic use. Cytokines have the potential to achieve the animal growth rates traditionally sought by the use of antibiotics without the contribution of antibiotic resistance associated with the widespread nontherapeutic uses of antibiotics currently used in the food animal production industries. In addition, CSIRO is working on vaccines for diseases.&lt;ref name=&quot;blogspot1&quot;/&gt;

Alternating therapy is a proposed method in which two or three antibiotics are taken in a rotation versus taking just one antibiotic such that bacteria resistant to one antibiotic are killed when the next antibiotic is taken. Studies have found that this method reduces the rate at which antibiotic resistant bacteria emerge in vitro relative to a single drug for the entire duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kim S, Lieberman TD, Kishony R | title = Alternating antibiotic treatments constrain evolutionary paths to multidrug resistance | journal = PNAS | volume = 111 | issue = 40 | pages = 14494–14499 | year=2014 | doi=10.1073/pnas.1409800111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development pipeline===
Since the discovery of antibiotics, [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) efforts have provided new drugs in time to treat bacteria that became resistant to older antibiotics, but in the 2000s there has been concern that development has slowed enough that seriously ill patients may run out of treatment options.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wp.dh.gov.uk/publications/files/2013/03/CMO-Annual-Report-Volume-2-20111.pdf CMO Annual Report]&lt;/ref&gt;  Another concern is that doctors may become reluctant to perform routine surgeries due to the increased risk of harmful infection.&lt;ref name=&quot;obama&quot; /&gt; Backup treatments can have serious side-effects; for example, treatment of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis can cause deafness and insanity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/2013/06/04/188566805/moldova-grapples-with-whether-to-isolate-tb-patients Moldova Grapples With Whether To Isolate TB Patients : NPR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The potential crisis at hand is the result of a marked decrease in industry R&amp;D.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Walsh |first=Fergus |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-21737844 |title=BBC News&amp;nbsp;— Antibiotics resistance 'as big a risk as terrorism' - medical chief |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poor financial investment in antibiotic research has exacerbated the situation.&lt;ref name=TheRealNews-2014-05-18/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt; In 2011, [[Pfizer]], one of the last major pharmaceutical companies developing new antibiotics, shut down its primary research effort, citing poor shareholder returns relative to drugs for chronic illnesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;medpage&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last= Gever |first=John |url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/InfectiousDisease/GeneralInfectiousDisease/24708 |title=Pfizer Moves May Dim Prospect for New Antibiotics |publisher=MedPage Today |date=2011-02-04 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, drug companies and the administration of [[President Barack Obama]] have been proposing changing the standards by which the FDA approves antibiotics targeted at resistant organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;obama&quot;&gt;[http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/06/04/188380562/obama-administration-seeks-to-loosen-antibiotic-approvals Obama Administration Seeks To Ease Approvals For Antibiotics : Shots - Health News : NPR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ledford H | title = FDA under pressure to relax drug rules | journal = Nature | volume = 492 | issue = 7427 | pages = 19 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23222585 | doi = 10.1038/492019a }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 12 December 2013, the Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment (ADAPT) Act of 2013 was introduced in the [[U.S. Congress]]. The ADAPT Act aims to fast-track the drug development in order to combat the growing public health threat of 'superbugs'. Under this Act, the FDA can approve antibiotics and antifungals needed for life-threatening infections based on data from smaller clinical trials. The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] will reinforce the monitoring of the use of antibiotics that treat serious and life-threatening infections and the emerging resistance, and make the data publicly available. The FDA antibiotics labeling process, 'Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria for Microbial Organisms' or 'breakpoints' is also streamlined to allow the most up-to-date and cutting-edge data available to healthcare professionals under the new Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.house.gov/press-release/green-gingrey-introduce-adapt-act-safeguard-public-health|title=Green, Gingrey Introduce ADAPT Act to Safeguard Public Health|author=Press Release|publisher=U.S. Congress|date=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assets.fiercemarkets.net/public/lifesciences/HR3742.pdf|title=Antibiotic Development to Advance Patient Treatment Act of 2013|publisher=U.S. Congress|date=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 September 2014 Obama signed an executive order &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/18/executive-order-combating-antibiotic-resistant-bacteria|title=Executive Order – Combating Antibiotics-Resistant Bacteria|author=Office of the Press Secretary|publisher=The White House|date=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to implement the recommendations proposed in a report &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/microsites/ostp/PCAST/pcast_carb_report_sept2014.pdf|title=Report to the President on Combating Antibiotic Resistance|author=President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology|publisher=PCAST|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology]] (PCAST) which outlines strategies to stream-line clinical trials and speed up the R&amp;D of new antibiotics.  Among the proposals:
*Create a 'robust, standing national clinical trials network for antibiotic testing' which will promptly enroll patients once identified to be suffering from dangerous bacterial infections.  The network will allow testing multiple new agents from different companies simultaneously for their safety and efficacy.
*Establish a 'Special Medical Use (SMU)' pathway for FDA to approve new antimicrobial agents for use in limited patient populations, shorten the approval timeline for new drug so patients with severe infections could benefit as quickly as possible.
*Provide economic incentives, especially for development of new classes of antibiotics, to offset the steep R&amp;D costs which drive away the industry to develop antibiotics.
The executive order also included a $20 million prize to encourage the development of diagnostic tests to identify highly resistant bacterial infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/antibiotics-rd-get-critical-lift-executive-order-obama-advisory-group/2014-09-19?utm_campaign=AddThis&amp;utm_medium=AddThis&amp;utm_source=twitter#.VBxQZCLB9Uo.twitter |title=Antibiotics R &amp; D to get critical lift by executive order, Obama advisory group|author=Mullin, Emily|publisher=fiercebiotech.com|date=19 September 2014|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] plans to fund a new research network on the issue up to $62&amp;nbsp;million from 2013 to 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nih.gov/news/health/jun2013/niaid-03.htm NIH to fund clinical research network on antibacterial resistance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Using authority created by the [[Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act]] of 2006, the [[Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority]] in the U.S. [[Department of Health and Human Services]] announced that it will spend between $40&amp;nbsp;million and $200&amp;nbsp;million in funding for R&amp;D on new antibiotic drugs under development by [[GlaxoSmithKline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/news/Pages/strategic-alliance-130522.aspx|title=HHS forms strategic alliance to develop new antibiotics Approach provides a pipeline of new drugs rather than a single medical countermeasure|author=Press Release|publisher=Public Health Emergency, U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|date=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanism===
In research published on October 17, 2008 in ''[[Cell (journal)|Cell]]'', a team of scientists pinpointed the place on bacteria where the antibiotic [[myxopyronin]] launches its attack, and why that attack is successful. The myxopyronin binds to and inhibits the crucial bacterial enzyme [[RNA polymerase]]. The myxopyronin changes the structure of the switch-2 segment of the enzyme, inhibiting its function of reading and transmitting DNA code. This prevents RNA polymerase from delivering genetic information to the [[ribosomes]], causing the bacteria to die.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mukhopadhyay J, Das K, Ismail S, Koppstein D, Jang M, Hudson B, Sarafianos S, Tuske S, Patel J, Jansen R, Irschik H, Arnold E, [[Richard H. Ebright|Ebright RH]] | title = The RNA polymerase &quot;switch region&quot; is a target for inhibitors | journal = Cell | volume = 135 | issue = 2 | pages = 295–307 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18957204 | pmc = 2580802 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2008.09.033 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a team of the University of Leipzig modified a peptide found in honeybees. It is effective against 37 types of bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cen.acs.org/articles/90/web/2012/05/Modified-Bee-Peptide-Slays-Deadly.html |title=Modified Bee Peptide Slays Deadly Bacteria &amp;#124; Chemical &amp; Engineering News |publisher=Cen.acs.org |date=2012-05-29 |accessdate=2013-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One major cause of antibiotic resistance is the increased pumping activity of microbial [[ABC transporters]], which diminishes the effective drug concentration inside the microbial cell. ABC transporter inhibitors that can be used in combination with current antimicrobials are being tested in clinical trials and are available for therapeutic regimens.&lt;ref name= Ponte-SucreA&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Ponte-Sucre |editor1-first=A | year=2009 |title=ABC Transporters in Microorganisms | publisher=Caister Academic Press | isbn= 978-1-904455-49-3}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applications===
Antibiotic resistance is an important tool for [[genetic engineering]]. By constructing a [[plasmid]] that contains an antibiotic-resistance gene as well as the gene being engineered or expressed, a researcher can ensure that, when bacteria replicate, only the copies that carry the plasmid survive. This ensures that the gene being manipulated passes along when the bacteria replicates.

In general, the most commonly used antibiotics in genetic engineering are &quot;older&quot; antibiotics that have largely fallen out of use in clinical practice. These include:
*[[ampicillin]]
*[[kanamycin]]
*[[tetracycline]]
*[[chloramphenicol]]

In industry, the use of antibiotic resistance is disfavored, since maintaining bacterial cultures would require feeding them large quantities of antibiotics. Instead, the use of [[auxotrophic]] bacterial strains (and function-replacement plasmids) is preferred.
