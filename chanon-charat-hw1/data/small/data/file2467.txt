'''Bayezid II''' or '''Sultân Bayezid-î Velî''' (December 3, 1447&amp;nbsp;– May 26, 1512) ([[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]: بايزيد ثانى ''Bāyezīd-i &lt;u&gt;s&lt;/u&gt;ānī'', [[Turkish language|Turkish]]:''II. Bayezid'' or ''II. Beyazıt'') was the eldest son and successor of [[Mehmed II]], ruling as [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1481 to 1512. During his reign, Bayezid II consolidated the Ottoman Empire and thwarted a [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] rebellion soon before abdicating his throne to his son, [[Selim I]]. He is most notable for evacuating [[Jews]] from [[Spain]] after the proclamation of the [[Alhambra Decree]] and resettling them throughout the [[Ottoman Empire]].

==Early life==
Bayezid II was the son of [[Mehmed II]] (1432–81). His mother's identity is undetermined; there are two main theories, that she was [[Emine Gülbahar Hatun]] or [[Sitti Mükrime Hatun]].

Bayezid II married [[Gülbahar Hatun]], who was the mother of his eldest son [[Şehzade Ahmet]], as well as Bayezid II's heir and successor, [[Selim I]] and nephew of [[Sitti Mükrime Hatun]].

==Fight for the throne==
Bayezid II's overriding concern was the quarrel with his brother [[Cem Sultan|Cem]], who claimed the throne and sought military backing from the Mamluks in Egypt.  Having been defeated by his brother's armies, Cem sought protection from the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights of St. John]] in [[Rhodes]].  Eventually, the Knights handed Cem over to [[Pope Innocent VIII]] (1484–1492).  The Pope thought of using Cem as a tool to drive the Turks out of Europe, but, as the papal crusade failed to come to fruition, Cem was left to languish and die in a Neapolitan prison. Bayezid II paid both the Knights Hospitaller and the pope to keep his brother prisoner.

==Reign==
Bayezid II ascended the Ottoman throne in 1481.&lt;ref name=&quot;WDL&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/8832/ |title = Sultan Bajazid's (i.e., Beyazit's) Mosque, Constantinople, Turkey |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = 1890–1900 |accessdate = 2013-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like his father, Bayezid II was a patron of western and eastern culture and unlike many other Sultans, worked hard to ensure a smooth running of domestic politics, which earned him the epithet of &quot;the Just&quot;.  Throughout his reign, Bayezid II engaged in numerous campaigns to conquer the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] possessions in [[Morea]], accurately defining this region as the key to future Ottoman naval power in the Eastern [[Mediterranean]]. [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1499–1503)|The last of these wars]] ended in 1501 with Bayezid II in control of the whole Peloponnese. Rebellions in the east, such as that of the [[Qizilbash]], plagued much of Bayezid II's reign and were often backed by the [[Shah]] of [[Iran|Persia]], [[Ismail I|Ismail]], who was eager to promote [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'ism]] to undermine the authority of the Ottoman state. Ottoman authority in [[Anatolia]] was indeed seriously threatened during this period, and at one point Bayezid II's grand [[vizier]], Ali Pasha, was killed in battle against rebels.

In July 1492, the new state of [[Spain]] expelled its [[Jewish]] and [[Muslims|Muslim]] populations as part of the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. Bayezid II sent out the [[Ottoman Navy]] under the command of Admiral [[Kemal Reis]] to Spain in 1492 in order to evacuate them safely to Ottoman lands. He sent out proclamations throughout the empire that the refugees were to be welcomed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Egger|first=Vernon O.|title=A History of the Muslim World Since 1260: The Making of a Global Community|accessdate=2009-04-13|year=2008|publisher=[[Prentice Hall]]|isbn=0-13-226969-4|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; He granted the refugees the permission to settle in the Ottoman Empire and become Ottoman citizens. He ridiculed the conduct of [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]] in expelling a class of people so useful to their subjects. &quot;You venture to call Ferdinand a wise ruler,&quot; he said to his courtiers&amp;nbsp;— &quot;he who has impoverished his own country and enriched mine!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JE 460&quot;&gt;''The Jewish Encyclopedia: a descriptive record of the history, religion, literature, and customs of the Jewish people from the earliest times to the present day,'' Vol.2 Isidore Singer, Cyrus Adler, Funk and Wagnalls, 1912 p.460&lt;/ref&gt; Bayezid addressed a [[firman (decree)|firman]] to all the governors of his European provinces, ordering them not only to refrain from repelling the Spanish refugees, but to give them a friendly and welcome reception.&lt;ref name=&quot;JE 460&quot;/&gt; He threatened with death all those who treated the Jews harshly or refused them admission into the empire. [[Moses Capsali]], who probably helped to arouse the sultan's friendship for the Jews, was most energetic in his assistance to the exiles. He made a tour of the communities, and was instrumental in imposing a tax upon the rich, to ransom the Jewish victims of the persecutions then prevalent.

The Muslims and Jews of [[al-Andalus]] (Iberia) contributed much to the rising power of the Ottoman Empire by introducing new ideas, methods and craftsmanship. The first [[Gutenberg press|printing press]] in Constantinople was established by the Sephardic Jews in 1493. It is reported that under Bayezid's reign, Jews enjoyed a period of cultural flourishing, with the presence of such scholars as the [[Talmudist]] and scientist [[Mordecai Comtino]]; astronomer and poet [[Solomon ben Elijah Sharbit|Solomon ben Elijah Sharbiṭ ha-Zahab]]; [[Shabbat|Shabbethai]] ben Malkiel Cohen, and the liturgical poet Menahem Tamar.

==Succession==
On September 14, 1509, [[Constantinople]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopædia Britannica'', Vol.7, Edited by Hugh Chisholm, (1911), 3; ''Constantinople, the capital of the Turkish Empire...''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9368294/Istanbul Britannica, Istanbul]:''When the Republic of Turkey was founded in 1923, the capital was moved to Ankara, and Constantinople was officially renamed Istanbul in 1930.''&lt;/ref&gt; was [[1509 Constantinople earthquake|devastated by an earthquake]]. Bayezid II's final years saw a succession battle between his sons [[Selim I]] and [[Şehzade Ahmet|Ahmet]]. Ahmet unexpectedly captured Karaman, an Ottoman city, and began marching to Constantinople to exploit his triumph. Fearing for his safety, Selim staged a revolt in [[Thrace]] but was defeated by Bayezid and forced to flee back to the [[Crimean Peninsula]]. Bayezid II developed fears that Ahmet might in turn kill him to gain the throne and refused to allow his son to enter Constantinople.

Selim returned from Crimea and, with support from the [[Janissary|Janissaries]], forced his father to abdicate the throne on  April 25, 1512. Beyazid departed for retirement in his native Demotika, but he died on May 26, 1512 at [[Büyükçekmece]] before reaching his destination, and only a month after his abdication. He was buried next to the [[Bayezid Mosque]] in [[Istanbul]].

== In popular culture ==
* Bayezid II is depicted in his childhood by [[Yiğitcan Elmalı]] in the 2012 Turkish film ''[[Fetih 1453]]''.
* Sultan Bayezid II's statesmanship, tolerance, and intellectual abilities are depicted in the historical novel ''The Sultan's Helmsman,'' which takes place in the middle years of his reign.
* Sultan Bayezid II and his struggle with his son Selim is a prominent motive in the video game ''[[Assassin's Creed: Revelations]]''. In the game, due to Bayezid's absence from Constantinople, the [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantines]] had the opportunity to sneak back into the city, hoping to revive their fallen empire. Near the end of the game, Bayezid surrendered the throne to his son Selim. However, Bayezid does not make an actual appearance.
* Cem is depicted during his time with [[Pope Innocent VIII]] and later [[Pope Alexander VI]] in the [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] series &quot;[[Borgia (TV series)|Borgia]]&quot;.
