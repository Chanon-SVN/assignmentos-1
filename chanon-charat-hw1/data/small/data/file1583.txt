The '''Atari 5200 SuperSystem''', commonly known as the '''Atari 5200''', is a [[home video game console]] that was introduced in 1982 by Atari Inc. as a higher-end complementary console for the popular [[Atari 2600]].&lt;ref name=&quot;milwaukeesentinel&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HN0VAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XRIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=929,140029&amp;dq=atari+5200&amp;hl=en |title=The Atari 5200 will be available in October |publisher=The Milwaukee Sentinel |date=1982-09-01 |accessdate=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 5200 was created to compete with the [[Intellivision]], but wound up more directly competing with the [[ColecoVision]] shortly after its release.&lt;ref&gt;G4TV's Icons season 2 episode 1 &quot;Atari&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The 5200 was based on Atari Inc.'s existing [[Atari 8-bit family|400/800]] computers and the internal hardware was almost identical, although software was not directly compatible between the two systems. The 5200's controllers have an analog joystick and a [[numeric keypad]] along with start, pause and reset buttons. The 360-degree non-centering joystick was touted as offering more control than the eight-way joystick controller offered with the Atari 2600.

{{Refimprove|section|date=February 2014}}
Much of the technology in the [[Atari 8-bit family]] of [[home computer]] systems were originally developed as a second-generation games console intended to replace the 2600. However, as the system was reaching completion, the personal computer revolution was starting with the release of machines like the [[Commodore PET]], [[TRS-80]] and [[Apple II]]. These machines were similar in technological terms to the 2600, but sold for much higher prices with associated higher profit margins. Atari's management decided to enter this market, and the new technology was repackaged into the Atari 400 and 800, hitting the market in 1979.

The chipset used in the 400 and 800 was designed because they were aware the 2600 would be obsolete by the 1980 time frame. What was surprising was the sudden entry into the market of new competition, whose machines quickly cut off the sales of the 2600. Atari decided to re-enter the games market with a design that closely matched their original 1978 specifications. In its prototype stage, the Atari 5200 was originally called the &quot;Atari Video System X - Advanced Video Computer System&quot;, and was codenamed &quot;Pam&quot; after a female employee at Atari Inc. It is also rumored that PAM actually stood for &quot;Personal Arcade Machine&quot;, as the majority of games for the system ended up being arcade conversions. Actual working ''Atari Video System X'' machines, whose hardware is 100% identical to the Atari 5200 do exist, but are extremely rare.&lt;ref name=&quot;vsx&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Curt Vendel |url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/5200/vsx.html |title=Video System X |publisher=Atarimuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial 1982 release of the system featured four controller ports, where nearly all other systems of the day had only one or two ports. The 5200 also featured a new style controller with an analog [[joystick]], numeric keypad, two fire buttons on each side of the controller and game function keys for Start, Pause, and Reset. The 5200 also featured the innovation of the first automatic TV switchbox, allowing it to automatically switch from regular TV viewing to the game system signal when the system was activated. Previous RF adapters required the user to slide a switch on the adapter by hand. This unique [[radio frequency|RF]] box was also where the power supply connected in a unique dual power/television signal setup similar to the [[RCA Studio II]]'s. A single cable coming out of the 5200 plugged into the switch box and was used for both electricity and the television signal.

The 1983 revision of the Atari 5200  has two controller ports instead of four, and a change back to the more conventional separate power supply and standard non-autoswitching RF switch. It also has changes in the cartridge port address lines to allow for the [[Atari 2600]] adapter released that year. While the adapter was only made to work on the two-port version, modifications can be made to the four-port to make it line-compatible. In fact, towards the end of the four-port model's production run, there were a limited number of consoles produced which included these modifications. These consoles can be identified by an asterisk in their serial number.

==Controllers==
[[File:Atari-5200-Controller.jpg|thumb|right|175px|The Atari 5200 controller]]The controller prototypes used in the electrical development lab used a yoke and gimbal mechanism that came from an RC airplane controller kit. This simple design gave smooth linear control and was highly reliable.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The design of the [[analog stick|analog joystick]], which used a weak rubber boot rather than springs to provide centering, proved to be ungainly and unreliable. They quickly became the [[Achilles' heel]] of the system because of their combination of an overly complex mechanical design with a very low-cost internal flex circuit system.&lt;ref name=&quot;atarimuseum&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/5200/A5200.html|title=The Atari 5200 Super System|publisher=atarimuseum.com|accessdate=2014-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major flaw of the controllers was that the design did not translate into a linear acceleration from the center through the arc of the stick travel. The controllers did, however, include a pause button, a unique feature at the time. Various third-party replacement joysticks were also released, including those made by Wico.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

Atari Inc. released the Pro-Line [[trackball|Trak-Ball]] controller for the system, which was used primarily for gaming titles such as ''[[Centipede]]'' and ''[[Missile Command]]''. A paddle controller&lt;ref name=&quot;paddle&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Curt Vendel |url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/5200/5200paddle.html |title=Atari 5200 Paddle Controller Prototypes |publisher=Atarimuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an updated self-centering version of the original controller&lt;ref name=&quot;selfcenter&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Curt Vendel |url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/5200/5200joy.html |title=Self Centering Joystick Prototypes |publisher=Atarimuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; were also in development, but never made it to market.

Games shipped with plastic card overlays that snapped in over the keypad. The card would indicate which game functions, such as changing the view or vehicle speed, were assigned to each key.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The primary controller was ranked the 10th worst video game controller by [[IGN]] editor Craig Harris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 10 Tuesday: Worst Game Controllers |url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/690/690449p1.html |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2009-08-07 |date=2006-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internal differences between the 5200 and the 400/800==
Although the Atari 5200's internal design was extensively based on that of the 400/800 home computers, the differences were sufficient that games designed for one would not run directly on the other.&lt;ref name=&quot;converting_similar_diffs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/5200/conv_to_5200.html|title=Transporting Atari computer programs to the Atari 5200|journal=[[A.N.A.L.O.G.]]|publication-date=1984-01|issue=15|accessdate=2014-06-05|quote=When Atari designed the 5200 &quot;Supersystem&quot; [..] they made use of the state-of-the-art hardware they put into their 400/800 home computers. As a result, the systems are quite similar. The differences  are great enough, however, that transporting programs from  one system to the other requires some effort.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most obvious differences was the 5200's lack of a [[computer keyboard|keyboard]]. However, there were several others:
* The [[Atari 8-bit family#Operating system|400/800's 10&amp;nbsp;KB operating system]] was replaced with a simpler 2&amp;nbsp;[[kilobyte|KB]] Operating system, of which 1&amp;nbsp;KB is the built-in character set.&lt;ref name=&quot;converting&quot;&gt;[http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/5200/conv_to_5200.html Transporting Atari computer programs to the Atari 5200], [[A.N.A.L.O.G.]] #15 (January 1984), via atarimuseum.com. Article retrieved 2007-04-22.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A number of important registers, such as those of the [[Atari 8-bit TIA|GTIA]] and [[POKEY]] chips appear at different memory locations.&lt;ref name=&quot;converting&quot; /&gt;
* The purpose of some registers changed slightly on the 5200.&lt;ref name=&quot;converting&quot; /&gt;
* The 5200's analog joysticks appeared as pairs of [[Paddle (game controller)|paddle]]s to the hardware, which required different input handling to the traditional digital joystick input on the 400/800.&lt;ref name=&quot;converting&quot; /&gt;

Atari Corp.'s later [[XEGS|XE Games System]] revisited the idea of a console based on the 400/800 hardware. However, as this was essentially just a 65XE computer with a detachable keyboard, it was (unlike the 5200) able to run most of the home computer titles directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Harris | first = Neil | title = Re: Is Atari killing the 8 bit? | date = May 12, 1987 | url = http://groups.google.ca/group/comp.sys.atari.8bit/msg/98a62e383f31d6cc?dmode=source | accessdate = 2014-06-05| institution = [[Atari Corporation|Atari Corp.]] | quote=So what we have with the XE Game System is essentially a 65XE in disguise.

At one point following the 5200's release, Atari had planned a smaller, cost-reduced version of the Atari 5200, which would have removed the controller storage bin. Code-named the &quot;Atari 5100&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Atari 5200 Jr.&quot;), only a few fully working prototype 5100s were made before the project was canceled.&lt;ref name=&quot;jr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Curt Vendel |url=http://www.atarimuseum.com/videogames/consoles/5100/5100.html |title=5100/5200 Jr |publisher=Atarimuseum.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 21, 1984, during a press conference at which the [[Atari 7800]] was introduced, company executives revealed that the 5200 had been discontinued after just two years on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Sanger | first=David E. | journal=New York Times | title=Atari Video Game Unit Introduced | page=3 (Section D) | date=1984-05-22 | quote=Company officials disclosed for the first time yesterday that the 5200 is no longer in production, and Atari appears to be selling off its inventory. | postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Total sales of the 5200 were reportedly in excess of 1&amp;nbsp;million units.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Schrage | first=Michael | journal=Washington Post | title=Atari Introduces Game In Attempt for Survival | page=C3 | date=1984-05-22 | quote=The company has stopped producing its 5200 SuperSystem games player, more than 1&amp;nbsp;million of which were sold. | postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
