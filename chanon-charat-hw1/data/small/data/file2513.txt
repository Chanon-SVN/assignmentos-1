Borel measure
      <text xml:space="preserve">In [[mathematics]], specifically in [[Measure (mathematics)|measure theory]], a '''Borel measure''' on  a [[topological space]] is a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] that is defined on all open sets (and thus on all [[Borel sets]]).&lt;ref&gt;D. H. Fremlin, 2000. ''[http://www.essex.ac.uk/maths/people/fremlin/mt.htm Measure Theory]''. Torres Fremlin.&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors require additional restrictions on the measure, as described below.

==Formal Definition==
Let ''X'' be a [[locally compact]] [[Hausdorff space]], and let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}(X)&lt;/math&gt; be the [[Sigma-algebra#Generated .CF.83-algebra|smallest σ-algebra]] that contains the [[open set]]s of ''X''; this is known as the σ-algebra of [[Borel set]]s.  Any measure ''μ'' defined on the σ-algebra of Borel sets is called a '''Borel measure'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Alan J. Weir | title=General integration and measure | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=1974 | isbn=0-521-29715-X | pages=158–184 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors require in addition that ''μ''(''C'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;∞ for every [[compact set]]&amp;nbsp;''C''. If a Borel measure ''μ'' is both [[inner regular]] and [[outer regular]], it is called a [[Borel regular measure|'''regular Borel measure''']] (some authors also require it to be [[Tightness of measures|tight]]). If ''μ'' is both inner regular and [[Locally finite measure|locally finite]], it is called a [[Radon measure]]. Note that a locally finite Borel measure automatically satisfies ''μ''(''C'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;∞ for every compact set&amp;nbsp;''C''.

==On the real line==
The [[real line]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; with its [[Real line#As a topological space|usual topology]] is a locally compact Hausdorff space, hence we can define a Borel measure on it. In this case, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{B}(\mathbb R)&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest σ-algebra that contains the open intervals of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;. While there are many Borel measures μ, the choice of Borel measure which assigns &lt;math&gt;\mu([a,b])=b-a&lt;/math&gt; for every interval &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; is sometimes called &quot;the&quot; Borel measure on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;. In practice, even &quot;the&quot; Borel measure is not the most useful measure defined on the σ-algebra of Borel sets; indeed, the [[Lebesgue measure]] &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is an extension of &quot;the&quot; Borel measure which possesses the crucial property that it is a [[complete measure]] (unlike the Borel measure). To clarify, when one says that the Lebesgue measure &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is an extension of the Borel measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, it means that every Borel-measurable set ''E'' is also a Lebesgue-measurable set, and the Borel measure and the Lebesgue measure coincide on the Borel sets (i.e., &lt;math&gt;\lambda(E)=\mu(E)&lt;/math&gt; for every Borel measurable set).

==Applications==

===Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral===
{{main|Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral}}
The [[Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral]] is the ordinary [[Lebesgue integral]] with respect to a measure known as the Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure, which may be associated to any function of [[bounded variation]] on the real line.  The Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure is a [[regular Borel measure]], and conversely every regular Borel measure on the real line is of this kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Halmos|first1=Paul R.|author1-link=Paul R. Halmos|title=Measure Theory | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | isbn=978-0-387-90088-9 | year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laplace transform===
{{main|Laplace transform}}
One can define the [[Laplace transform]] of a finite Borel measure μ on the [[real line]] by the [[Lebesgue integral]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Feller|1971|loc=§XIII.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{L}\mu)(s) = \int_{[0,\infty)} e^{-st}d\mu(t).&lt;/math&gt;

An important special case is where μ is a [[probability measure]] or, even more specifically, the Dirac delta function. In [[operational calculus]], the Laplace transform of a measure is often treated as though the measure came from a [[distribution function]] ''f''.  In that case, to avoid potential confusion, one often writes

: &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{L}f)(s) = \int_{0^-}^\infty e^{-st}f(t)\,dt&lt;/math&gt;

where the lower limit of 0&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is shorthand notation for

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{\varepsilon\downarrow 0}\int_{-\varepsilon}^\infty.&lt;/math&gt;

This limit emphasizes that any point mass located at 0 is entirely captured by the Laplace transform.  Although with the [[Lebesgue integral]], it is not necessary to take such a limit, it does appear more naturally in connection with the [[Laplace–Stieltjes transform]].

===Hausdorff dimension and Frostman's lemma===
{{main|Hausdorff dimension|Frostman's lemma}}

Given a Borel measure μ on a metric space ''X'' such that μ(''X'') &gt; 0 and μ(''B''(''x'', ''r'')) ≤ ''r&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;'' holds for some constant ''s'' &gt; 0 and for every ball ''B''(''x'', ''r'') in ''X'', then the [[Hausdorff dimension]] dim&lt;sub&gt;Haus&lt;/sub&gt;(''X'') ≥ ''s''. A partial converse is provided by [[Frostman's lemma]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Lemma:''' Let ''A'' be a [[Borel measurable|Borel]] subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, and let ''s''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0. Then the following are equivalent:
*''H''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt;(''A'')&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, where ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the ''s''-dimensional [[Hausdorff measure]].
*There is an (unsigned) Borel measure ''&amp;mu;'' satisfying ''&amp;mu;''(''A'')&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, and such that 
::&lt;math&gt;\mu(B(x,r))\le r^s&lt;/math&gt; 
:holds for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''r''&gt;0.

===Cramér–Wold theorem===
{{main|Cramér–Wold theorem}}
The [[Cramér–Wold theorem]] in [[measure theory]] states that a Borel [[probability measure]] on &lt;math&gt;R^k&lt;/math&gt; is uniquely determined by the totality of its one-dimensional projections.&lt;ref&gt;K. Stromberg, 1994. ''Probability Theory for Analysts''. Chapman and Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; It is used as a method for proving joint convergence results. The theorem is named after [[Harald Cramér]] and [[Herman Ole Andreas Wold]].
