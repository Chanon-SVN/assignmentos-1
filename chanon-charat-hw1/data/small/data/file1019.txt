'''Andrea Alciato''' (8 May 1492 â€“ 12 January 1550),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bregman|first=Alvan|title=Emblemata: The emblem books of Andrea Alciato|year=2007|publisher=Bird &amp; Bull Press|location=Newtown, Pa}}&lt;/ref&gt; commonly known as '''Alciati''' ('''Andreas Alciatus'''), was an Italian [[jurist]] and writer.&lt;ref&gt;D. Bianchi, 1913. &quot;L'opera letteraria e storica di Andrea Alciato&quot;, Archivio storico lombardo'', 4th series'''20''':47-57.&lt;/ref&gt;  He is regarded as the founder of the French school of [[legal humanists]].

==Biography==
Alciati was born in [[Alzate Brianza]], near [[Milan]], and settled in France in the early 16th century. He displayed great literary skill in his exposition of the laws, and was one of the first to interpret the [[civil law (common law)|civil law]] by the history, languages and literature of antiquity, and to substitute original research for the servile interpretations of the glossators. He published many legal works, and some annotations on [[Tacitus]] and accumulated a sylloge of Roman inscriptions from Milan and its territories, as part of his preparation for his history of Milan, written in 1504-05.&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Weiss, 1969. ''The Renaissance Discovery of Antiquity'', pp 152f.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Alciati is most famous for his ''[[Emblemata]],'' published in dozens of editions from 1531 onward. This collection of short Latin verse texts and accompanying woodcuts created an entire European genre, the [[emblem book]], which attained enormous popularity in continental [[Europe]] and [[Great Britain]].

Alciati died at [[Pavia]] in 1550.
