'''Alexander II''' was a king of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]], and the son of [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]] and [[Lanassa (wife of Pyrrhus)|Lanassa]], the daughter of the Sicilian tyrant [[Agathocles of Syracuse|Agathocles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DGRBM&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Mason | first = Charles Peter | authorlink = | title = Alexander | editor = [[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]] | encyclopedia = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1 | pages = 116 | publisher = [[Little, Brown and Company]] | location = Boston | year = 1867 | url = http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=moa;cc=moa;idno=acl3129.0001.001;size=l;frm=frameset;seq=131;page=root;view=image}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reign==
[[Image:Coin of Alexander II of Epirus.png|right|thumb|200px|Illustration of silver coin of Alexander]]
He succeeded his father as king in 272 BC, and continued the war which his father had begun with [[Antigonus II Gonatas]], whom he succeeded in driving from the kingdom of [[Macedon]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}  
He was, however, dispossessed of both [[Macedon]] and [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]] by [[Demetrius II of Macedon]], the son of Antigonus II; upon which he took refuge amongst the [[Acarnania]]ns. By their assistance and that of his own subjects, who entertained a great attachment for him, he recovered Epirus. It appears that he was in alliance with the [[Aetolia]]ns.  He married his paternal half-sister [[Olympias II of Epirus]], by whom he had two sons, [[Pyrrhus II of Epirus]], [[Ptolemy of Epirus]] and a daughter, [[Phthia of Macedon]]. 
On the death of Alexander, around 242 BC, Olympias assumed the regency on behalf of her sons, and married Phthia to Demetrius.&lt;ref&gt;''Universal Pronouncing Dictionary of Biography and Mythology'', by Joseph Thomas - 1908 - page 90&lt;/ref&gt;  
There are extant silver and copper coins of this king.  
The former bear a youthful head covered with the skin of an elephant's head.  
The reverse represents Pallas holding a spear in one hand and a shield in the other, and before her stands an eagle on a thunderbolt.&lt;ref&gt;[[Justin (historian)|Justin]], xvii. 1, xxvi. 2, 3, xxviii. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Polybius]],  ii. 45, ix. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Pyrrhus'' 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with India==
Alexander is apparently mentioned in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]], as one of the recipients of the Indian Emperor [[Ashoka the Great|Ashoka]]'s [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] proselytism.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The conquest by [[Dharma]] has been won here, on the borders, and even six hundred [[yojana]]s (5,400-9,600 km) away, where the Greek king [[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochos]] rules, beyond there where the four kings named [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy]], [[Antigonus Gonatas|Antigonos]], [[Magas of Cyrene|Magas]] and Alexander rule, likewise in the south among the [[Chola dynasty|Chola]]s, the [[Pandya]]s, and as far as [[Tamraparni]] ([[Sri Lanka]]).&quot; ([[Edicts of Ashoka]], 13th Rock Edict, S. Dhammika).&lt;/ref&gt;
