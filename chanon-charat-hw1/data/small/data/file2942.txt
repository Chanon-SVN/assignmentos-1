Bézout's identity
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bézout's identity''' (also called '''Bézout's lemma''') is a theorem in the elementary [[number theory|theory of numbers]]: let ''a'' and ''b'' be nonzero [[integer]]s and let ''d'' be their [[greatest common divisor]]. Then there exist integers ''x'' and ''y'' such that
: &lt;math&gt; ax+by=d &lt;/math&gt;
In addition, i) ''d'' is the smallest positive integer that can be written as 
{{nowrap|''ax'' + ''by'',}}
and ii) every integer of the form 
{{nowrap|''ax'' + ''by'' }}
is a multiple of ''d''. ''x'' and ''y'' are called '''Bézout coefficients''' for (''a'', ''b''); they are not unique. A pair of Bézout coefficients can be computed by the [[extended Euclidean algorithm]]. If both ''a'' and ''b'' are nonzero, the extended Euclidean algorithm produces one of the two pairs such that &lt;math&gt;|x|&lt;\left |\tfrac{b}{d}\right |&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|y|&lt;\left |\tfrac{a}{d}\right |.&lt;/math&gt;

Bézout's lemma is true in any [[principal ideal domain]], but there are [[integral domain]]s in which it is not true.

==Structure of solutions==

When one pair of Bézout coefficients (''x'', ''y'') has been computed (e.g., using [[extended Euclidean algorithm]]), all pairs can be represented in the form
:&lt;math&gt;\left(x+k\frac{b}{\gcd(a,b)},\ y-k\frac{a}{\gcd(a,b)}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''k''}} is an arbitrary integer and the fractions simplify to integers.

Among these pairs of Bézout coefficients, exactly two of them satisfy 
:&lt;math&gt; |x| &lt; \left |\frac{b}{\gcd(a,b)}\right |\quad \text{and}\quad |y| &lt; \left |\frac{a}{\gcd(a,b)}\right |.&lt;/math&gt;
This relies on a property of [[Euclidean division]]: given two integers ''c'' and ''d'', if ''d'' does not divide ''c'', there is exactly one pair {{math|(''q'',''r'')}} such that {{math|1=''c'' = ''dq'' + ''r''}} and {{math|1=0 &lt; ''r'' &lt; {{!}}''d''{{!}}}}, and another one such that {{math|1=''c'' = ''dq'' + ''r''}} and {{math|1=0 &lt; -''r'' &lt; {{!}}''d''{{!}}}}.

The Extended Euclidean algorithm always produces one of these two minimal pairs.

===Example===

Let ''a'' = 12 and ''b'' = 42, gcd (12, 42) = 6. Then we have the following Bézout's identities, with the Bézout coefficients written in red for the minimal pairs and in blue for the other ones.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\vdots \\
12 &amp;\times \color{blue}{-10} &amp; + \;\; 42  &amp;\times \color{blue}{3} &amp;= 6 \\
12 &amp;\times \color{red}{-3} &amp; + \;\;42  &amp;\times \color{red}{1} &amp;= 6 \\
12 &amp;\times \color{red}{4}  &amp; + \;\;42  &amp;\times\color{red}{-1} &amp;= 6 \\
12 &amp;\times \color{blue}{11} &amp; + \;\;42  &amp;\times \color{blue}{-3} &amp;= 6 \\
12 &amp;\times \color{blue}{18} &amp; + \;\;42  &amp;\times \color{blue}{-5} &amp;= 6 \\
\vdots
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof==
Bézout's lemma is a consequence of the [[Euclidean division]] defining property, namely that the  division by a nonzero integer ''b'' has a [[remainder]] strictly less than |''b''|. The proof that follows may be adapted for any [[Euclidean domain]]. For given nonzero integers ''a'' and ''b'' there is a nonzero integer {{nowrap|''d'' {{=}} ''as'' + ''bt''}} of minimal absolute value among all those of the form ''ax'' + ''by'' with ''x'' and ''y'' integers; one can assume ''d'' &amp;gt; 0 by changing the signs of both ''s'' and ''t'' if necessary. Now the remainder of dividing either ''a'' or ''b'' by ''d'' is also of the form ''ax'' + ''by'' since it is obtained by subtracting a multiple of {{nowrap|''d'' {{=}} ''as'' + ''bt''}} from ''a'' or ''b'', and on the other hand it has to be strictly smaller in absolute value than ''d''. This leaves 0 as only possibility for such a remainder, so ''d'' divides ''a'' and ''b'' exactly.
If ''c'' is another common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'', then ''c'' also divides ''as'' + ''bt'' = ''d''. Since ''c'' divides ''d'' but is not equal to it, it must be less than ''d''. This means that ''d'' is the greatest common divisor of ''a'' and ''b''; this completes the proof.

==Generalizations==
===For three or more integers===

Bézout's identity can be extended to more than two integers: if 
:&lt;math&gt;\gcd(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) = d&lt;/math&gt; 

then there are integers &lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n&lt;/math&gt; 

such that

:&lt;math&gt;d = a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \cdots + a_n x_n,&lt;/math&gt;

has the following properties:
# ''d'' is smallest positive integer of this form
# every number of this form is a multiple of ''d''
# ''d'' is a [[greatest common divisor]] of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, meaning that every common divisor of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; divides ''d''

===For polynomials===
{{main|Polynomial greatest common divisor#Bézout's identity and extended GCD algorithm}}
Bézout's identity works for [[univariate polynomial]]s over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] exactly in the same ways as for integers. In particular the Bézout's coefficients and the greatest common divisor may be computed with the [[Extended Euclidean algorithm]].

As the common [[root of a polynomial|root]]s of two polynomials are the roots of their greatest common divisor, Bézout's identity and [[fundamental theorem of algebra]] imply the following result: 
:For univariate polynomials ''f'' and ''g'' with coefficients in a field, there exist polynomials ''a'' and ''b'' such that ''af'' + ''bg'' = 1 if and only if ''f'' and ''g'' have no common root in any [[algebraically closed field]] (commonly the field of [[complex number]]s).

The generalization of this result to any number of polynomials and indeterminates is [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]].

===For principal ideal domains===
As noted in the introduction, Bézout's identity works not only in the [[ring (algebra)|ring]] of integers, but also in any other [[principal ideal domain]] (PID).
That is, if ''R'' is a PID, and ''a'' and ''b'' are elements of ''R'', and ''d'' is a greatest common divisor of ''a'' and ''b'',
then there are elements ''x'' and ''y'' in ''R'' such that ''ax'' + ''by'' = ''d''. The reason: the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] ''Ra''+''Rb'' is principal and indeed is equal to ''Rd''.

An integral domain in which Bézout's identity holds is called a [[Bézout domain]].

==History==

[[French people|French]] [[mathematician]] [[Étienne Bézout]] (1730–1783) proved this identity for polynomials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bézout, É.|authorlink=Étienne Bézout|url=http://books.google.fr/books?id=FoxbAAAAQAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PP5 |title=Théorie générale des équations algébriques |place=Paris, France |publisher=Ph.-D. Pierres |year=1779}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this statement for integers can be found already in the work of another French mathematician, [[Claude Gaspard Bachet de Méziriac]] (1581–1638).&lt;ref&gt;

Deux nombres premiers entre eux estant donnez, treuver le moindre multiple de chascun d’iceux, surpassant de l’unité un multiple de l’autre.”  (Given two numbers [which are] relatively prime, find the lowest multiple of each of them [such that] one multiple exceeds the other by unity (1).)  This problem (namely, ax - by = 1) is a special case of Bézout’s equation and was used by Bachet to solve the problems appearing on pages 199 ff.
