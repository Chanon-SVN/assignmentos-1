&lt;!-- Efficacy --&gt;
Evidence on the effectiveness of acupuncture is &quot;variable and inconsistent&quot; for any condition.&lt;ref name=Colquhoun2013/&gt; An overview of high-quality [[Cochrane Collaboration|Cochrane review]]s suggested that acupuncture may alleviate some, but not all, kinds of pain.&lt;ref name=Lee2011/&gt; A [[systematic review]] of systematic reviews found that for reducing pain, real acupuncture was no better than sham acupuncture and concluded that there is little evidence that acupuncture is an effective treatment for reducing pain.{{refn |group=n |name= Madsen2009 |Placebo or sham acupuncture is a form of acupuncture that uses non-penetrating needles or needling at non-acupuncture points.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Madsen|2009|page=a3115}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Ernst 2011&quot;/&gt; Although minimally invasive, the puncturing of the [[Epidermis (skin)|skin]] with acupuncture needles poses problems when designing trials that adequately [[Scientific control|control]] for [[placebo|placebo effects]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17265547&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16783282&quot;/&gt; Some of the research results suggest acupuncture can alleviate pain but others consistently suggest that acupuncture's effects are mainly due to placebo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ernst2006&quot;/&gt; The evidence suggests that short-term treatment with acupuncture does not produce long-term benefits.&lt;ref name=Wang-2008/&gt; A systematic review concluded that the analgesic effect of acupuncture seemed to lack clinical relevance and could not be clearly distinguished from bias.&lt;ref name=Madsen2009/&gt;

&lt;!-- Safety and Cost-effectiveness --&gt;
Acupuncture is generally safe when done by an appropriately trained practitioner using clean technique and single-use needles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Xu S&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=NCCAM2012/&gt; When properly delivered, it has a low rate of mostly minor [[adverse effects]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 2011&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Xu S&quot;/&gt; Between 2000 and 2009, at least ninety-five cases of serious adverse events, including five deaths, were reported to have resulted from acupuncture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ernst 2011&quot;/&gt; Many of the serious events were reported from developed countries and many were due to [[malpractice]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ernst 2011&quot;/&gt; The most frequently reported adverse events were [[pneumothorax]] and infections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ernst 2011&quot;/&gt; Since serious adverse events continue to be reported, it is recommended that acupuncturists be trained sufficiently to reduce the risk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ernst 2011&quot;/&gt; A meta-analysis found that acupuncture for chronic low back pain was [[cost-effective]] as an adjunct to standard care, but not as a substitute for standard care except in cases where comorbid depression presented,&lt;ref name=Taylor2013/&gt; while a systematic review found insufficient evidence for the cost-effectiveness of acupuncture in the treatment of chronic low back pain.&lt;ref name=Standaert2011/&gt;

&lt;!-- Mechanism, Epidemiology and History --&gt;
Acupuncture has been the subject of active scientific research, both in regard to its basis and therapeutic effectiveness, since the late 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17265547&quot;/&gt; Scientific investigation has not found any [[histology|histological]] or [[physiology|physiological]] evidence for traditional Chinese concepts such as ''qi'', meridians, and acupuncture points,{{refn |group=n |name= &quot;SinghErnst2008&quot; |Singh &amp; Ernst (2008) stated, &quot;Scientists are still unable to find a shred of evidence to support the existence of meridians or Ch'i&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singh &amp; Ernst|2008|page= 72}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The traditional principles of acupuncture are deeply flawed, as there is no evidence at all to demonstrate the existence of Ch'i or meridians&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singh &amp; Ernst|2008|page= 107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Acupuncture points and meridians are not a reality, but merely the product of an ancient Chinese philosophy&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Singh &amp; Ernst|2008|page= 387}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name = Bauer/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ahn2008&quot;/&gt; and some contemporary practitioners use acupuncture without following the traditional Chinese approach&lt;ref name=Mann2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peñas2010&quot;/&gt; and have abandoned the concepts of ''qi'' and meridians as [[pseudoscientific]].&lt;ref name = Williams2013/&gt;&lt;ref name = Ulett2002/&gt; TCM has been described as mainly pseudoscience, with no logical [[mechanism of action]] for the majority of its treatments.&lt;ref name=swallow/&gt; Acupuncture is currently used widely throughout China and many other countries, including the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Xu S&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhang-2010/&gt; It is uncertain exactly when acupuncture originated or how it evolved, but it is generally thought to derive from [[History of Science and Technology in China|ancient China]].&lt;ref name=White-Ernst/&gt; Chinese history attributes the introduction of acupuncture to the emperor [[Shennong]].&lt;ref name=NLM2012/&gt; Hieroglyphs and [[Pictogram|pictographs]] have been found dating from the [[Shang Dynasty]] (1600–1100 BCE), which suggests that acupuncture was practiced along with moxibustion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robson&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Aiguille d acupuncture avec regle.dsc02265.untilted+cropped+WB.jpg|thumb|One type of acupuncture needle]]

Acupuncture is the stimulation of precisely defined, specific [[acupuncture point]]s along the skin of the body using thin needles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 2011&quot;/&gt; It is associated with the application of heat, pressure, or laser light to these same points.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 2011&quot;/&gt; In a modern acupuncture session, an initial consultation is followed by taking the pulse on both arms and inspecting the tongue. Classically, in clinical practice, acupuncture is highly individualized and based on philosophy and intuition, and not on controlled scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Schwartz | first=L | url=http://www.medicalacupuncture.org/aama_marf/journal/vol12_1/evidence.html |journal=Medical Acupuncture | pages=38–41 | year=2000 |volume=12 | issue=1 | title=Evidence-Based Medicine And Traditional Chinese Medicine: Not Mutually Exclusive}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number and frequency of acupuncture sessions vary, but most practitioners do not think one session is sufficient.&lt;ref name=Berman2010&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Brian |last1=Berman |first2=Helene |last2=Langevin |first3=Claudia |last3=Witt |first4=Ronald |last4=Dubner |title=Acupuncture for Low Back Pain |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=363 |issue=5 |date=July 29, 2010 |doi=10.1056/NEJMct0806114 |pmid=20818865 |pages=454–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial evaluation may last up to 60 minutes.&lt;ref name=mayo2012/&gt; Subsequent visits typically last about a half an hour.&lt;ref name=mayo2012/&gt; A common treatment plan for a single complaint usually involves six to twelve treatments, planned out over a few months.&lt;ref name=mayo2012/&gt; A typical session entails lying still while approximately five to twenty needles are inserted; for the majority of cases, the needles will be left in place for ten to twenty minutes.&lt;ref name=mayo2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/acupuncture/basics/what-you-can-expect/prc-20020778|work=Mayo Clinic Staff|publisher=[[Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research]]|title=What you can expect|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Needles ===
[[File:Acupuncture Needles.jpg|thumb|right|Acupuncture needles]]
[[File:Japanese kudabari.jpg|thumb|right|Traditional and modern Japanese guiding tube needles]]
Acupuncture needles are typically made of stainless steel, making them flexible and preventing them from rusting or breaking.&lt;ref name=Hicks2005/&gt; Needles are usually disposable, and are thrown away after use to prevent contamination.&lt;ref name=Hicks2005/&gt; Reusable needles are sometimes used as well, though they must be sterilized between uses.&lt;ref name=Hicks2005&gt;{{cite book |author=Angela Hicks |edition=1 |pages=41 |title=The Acupuncture Handbook: How Acupuncture Works and How It Can Help You |publisher=[[Piatkus Books]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-0749924720}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Collinge, William J. |title=The American Holistic Health Association Complete guide to alternative medicine |publisher=Warner Books |location=New York |year=1996 |isbn=0-446-67258-0 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Needles vary in length between {{convert|13|to|130|mm|in}}, with shorter needles used near the face and eyes, and longer needles in more fleshy areas; needle diameters vary from 0{{convert|.16|mm|3|abbr=on}} to 0{{convert|.46|mm|3|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name = Aung116&gt;[[#Aung2007|Aung &amp; Chen]], 2007, p.

Thinner needles may be flexible and require tubes for insertion. The tip of the needle should not be made too sharp to prevent breakage, although blunt needles cause more pain.&lt;ref name=FCA&gt;{{cite book| pages = [http://books.google.com/books?id=bKoMiuhSb3YC&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 2–3] | title = Fundamentals of Chinese Acupuncture | last = Ellis | first = A | isbn = 091211133X | publisher = Paradigm Publications | year = 1991 | author2 = Wiseman N; Boss K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the usual filiform needle, other needle types include three-edged needles and the Nine Ancient Needles.&lt;ref name = Aung116/&gt; Japanese acupuncturists use extremely thin needles that are used superficially, sometimes without penetrating the skin, and surrounded by a guide tube (a 17th-century invention adopted in China and the West). [[Korea]]n acupuncture uses copper needles and has a greater focus on the hand.&lt;ref name = Dummies&gt;{{cite book | pages = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=b6_1FOwC_GYC&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 126–8] | title = Complementary Medicine For Dummies | last = Young | first = J | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | year = 2007 | isbn = 0470519681 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Needling technique ===

==== Insertion ====

The skin is sterilized, such as with alcohol, and the needles are inserted, frequently with a plastic guide tube. Needles may be manipulated in various ways, including spinning, flicking, or moving up and down relative to the skin. Since most pain is felt in the superficial layers of the skin, a quick insertion of the needle is recommended.&lt;ref name = Aung2007&gt;[[#Aung2007|Aung &amp; Chen]], 2007, p. [http://books.google.ca/books?id=I6NclaeDWjgC&amp;pg=PA113#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 113-4].&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the needles are stimulated by hand in order to cause a dull, localized, aching sensation that is called ''de qi'', as well as &quot;needle grasp,&quot; a tugging feeling felt by the acupuncturist and generated by a mechanical interaction between the needle and skin.&lt;ref name=Berman2010/&gt; Acupuncture can be painful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = B. Y. | last2 = Cobbin | first2 = D. M. | title = Investigating the effects of three needling parameters (manipulation, retention time, and insertion site) on needling sensation and pain profiles: A study of eight deep needling interventions | journal = Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine | volume = 2013 | page = 136763 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24159337 | pmc = 3789497 | doi = 10.1155/2013/136763 | author1 = Loyeung }}&lt;/ref&gt; The skill level of the acupuncturist may influence how painful the needle insertion is, and a sufficiently skilled practitioner may be able to insert the needles without causing any pain.&lt;ref name = Aung2007/&gt;

==== ''De-qi'' sensation ====

''De-qi'' ({{zh|s=得气|p=dé qì}}; &quot;arrival of qi&quot;) refers to a sensation of [[paresthesia|numbness]], distension, or electrical tingling at the needling site which might radiate along the corresponding [[Meridian (Chinese medicine)|meridian]]. If ''de-qi'' can not be generated, then inaccurate location of the [[acupoint]], improper depth of needle insertion, inadequate manual manipulation, or a very weak constitution of the patient have to be considered, all of which are thought to decrease the likelihood of successful treatment. If the ''de-qi'' sensation doesn't immediately occur upon needle insertion, various manual manipulation techniques can be applied to promote it (such as &quot;plucking&quot;, &quot;shaking&quot; or &quot;trembling&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;AungChen2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Steven Aung|author2=William Chen|title=Clinical Introduction to Medical Acupuncture|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=I6NclaeDWjgC|accessdate=20 September 2012|date=10 January 2007|publisher=Thieme|isbn=9781588902214|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once ''de-qi'' is achieved, further techniques might be utilized which aim to &quot;influence&quot; the ''de-qi''; for example, by certain manipulation the ''de-qi'' sensation allegedly can be conducted from the needling site towards more distant sites of the body.&lt;!---is this threading?---&gt; Other techniques aim at &quot;tonifying&quot; ({{zh|s=补|p=bǔ}}) or &quot;sedating&quot; ({{zh|s=泄|p=xiè}}) qi.&lt;ref name=&quot;AungChen2007&quot;/&gt; The former techniques are used in [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Basic principles of pattern discrimination|deficiency]] patterns, the latter in excess patterns.&lt;ref name=&quot;AungChen2007&quot;/&gt;

''De qi'' is more important in Chinese acupuncture, while Western and Japanese patients may not consider it a necessary part of the treatment.&lt;ref name = Dummies/&gt;

==== Non-invasive needling ====

There is also a [[invasiveness of surgical procedures#Non-invasive procedure|non-invasive]] therapy developed in early 20th century Japan using an elaborate set of &quot;needles&quot; for the treatment of children (''shōnishin'' or ''shōnihari'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Stephen Birch |chapter= |pages= |title=Japanese Pediatric Acupuncture|publisher=Thieme |year=2011 |isbn=978-3131500618}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thomas Wernicke |chapter= |pages= |title=The Art of Non-Invasive Paediatric Acupuncture|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers |year=2014 |isbn=978-1848191600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, acupuncture was used to treat [[acute (medicine)|acute conditions]] while moxibustion was used for [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic diseases]]. Moxibustion could be direct (the cone was placed directly on the skin and allowed to burn the skin producing a blister and eventually a scar), or indirect (either a cone of moxa was placed on a slice of garlic, ginger or other vegetable, or a cylinder of moxa was held above the skin, close enough to either warm or burn it).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Needham2002|Needham &amp; Lu]], 2002, pp [http://books.google.com/books?id=0–0tdqBr58cC&amp;pg=PA170#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 170–173].&lt;/ref&gt; Cupping therapy is an ancient Chinese form of [[alternative medicine]] in which a local suction is created on the skin; practitioners believe this mobilizes blood flow in order to promote healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.britishcuppingsociety.org |title=British Cupping Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tui na]] is a TCM method of attempting to stimulate the flow of qi by various bare-handed techniques that do not involve needles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/tui+na |title=Tui na |author=Farlex |year=2012 |publisher=Farlex}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electroacupuncture]] is a form of acupuncture in which acupuncture needles are attached to a device that generates continuous electric pulses (this has been described as &quot;essentially transdermal electrical nerve stimulation &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation|TENS]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; masquerading as acupuncture&quot;).&lt;ref name = Colquhoun2013/&gt; Sonopuncture is a stimulation of the body similar to acupuncture using sound instead of needles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Educational Opportunities in Integrative Medicine |chapter=Sonopuncture |page=[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BNR1KGJXX9cC&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 34] |publisher=The Hunter Press |year=2008 |isbn=9780977655243}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be done using purpose-built transducers to direct a narrow [[ultrasound]] beam to a depth of 6–8 centimetres at acupuncture meridian points on the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Alternative Therapies |author=Bhagat |year=2004 |isbn=9788180612206 |pages=[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oKfvc8bvGwsC&amp;pg=PA165#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 164–165]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, [[tuning fork]]s or other sound emitting devices are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher= [[American Cancer Society]] |year=2000 |isbn=9780944235249 |page=158 |chapter=Sonopuncture |title=American Cancer Society's Guide to complementary and alternative cancer methods |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acupuncture point injection is the injection of various substances (such as drugs, [[vitamin]]s or [[herbal extract]]s) into acupoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=467825 | title =  Cancer Dictionary – Acupuncture point injection | accessdate = 4 April 2011 | publisher = [[National Cancer Institute]] | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110327191321/http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?CdrID=467825| archivedate= 27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Auriculotherapy]], commonly known as ear acupuncture, auricular acupuncture, or auriculoacupuncture, is considered to date back to ancient China which involves inserting needles to stimulate points on the [[outer ear]].&lt;ref name=Barrett2008/&gt; The modern approach was developed in France during the early 1950s.&lt;ref name=Barrett2008/&gt; There is no scientific evidence that it can cure disease; the evidence of effectiveness is negligible.&lt;ref name=Barrett2008&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barrett, M.D.|first1=Stephen|title=Auriculotherapy: A Skeptical Look|url=http://www.acuwatch.org/reports/auriculotherapy.shtml|website=Acupuncture Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scalp acupuncture, developed in Japan, is based on reflexological considerations regarding the [[scalp]] area.

A 2012 review found that the effectiveness of acupuncture to treat [[rheumatoid arthritis]] is &quot;sparse and inconclusive.&quot;&lt;ref name=Urruela2012/&gt; A 2005 Cochrane review concluded that acupuncture use to treat rheumatoid arthritis &quot;has no effect on ESR, CRP, pain, patient's global assessment, number of swollen joints, number of tender joints, general health, disease activity and reduction of analgesics.&quot;&lt;ref name=Casimiro2005&gt;{{cite journal|title=Acupuncture and electroacupuncture for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|year=2005| volume=2005 |issue=4|pages=CD003788|doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD003788.pub2|editor1-first=Lynn|url=http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab003788.html|accessdate=6 May 2008|pmid=16235342|last1=Casimiro|first1=L|last2=Barnsley|editor1-last=Casimiro|first2=L|last3=Brosseau|first3=L|last4=Milne|first4=S|last5=Robinson|first5=VA|last6=Tugwell|first6=P|last7=Wells|first7=G| last8=Casimiro|first8=Lynn | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080413045937/http://www.cochrane.org/reviews/en/ab003788.html| archivedate= 13 April 2008|displayauthors= 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 overview of systematic reviews found insufficient evidence to recommend acupuncture in the treatment of most rheumatic conditions, with the exceptions of osteoarthritis, low back pain, and lateral elbow pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ernst|first1=E.|last2=Lee|first2=M.

=== Stroke ===

A 2014 overview of systematic reviews and meta-analyses found that the evidence does not demonstrate acupuncture helps reduce the rates of death or disability after a stroke or improve other aspects of stroke recovery, such as poststroke motor dysfunction, but the evidence suggests it may help with poststroke neurological impairment and dysfunction such as [[dysphagia]], which would need to be confirmed with future rigorous studies.&lt;ref name=post-stroke&gt;{{cite journal |author=Zhang JH, Wang D, Liu M |title=Overview of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of acupuncture for stroke |journal=Neuroepidemiology |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=50–8 |year=2014 |pmid=24356063 |doi=10.1159/000355435 |type=Systematic review}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 review found evidence of benefit for acupuncture combined with exercise in treating shoulder pain after stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 =Lee |first1= JA |last2= Park |first2=SW |last3= Hwang |first3=PW |last4= Lim |first4= SM |last5= Kook |first5=S |last6= Choi |first6= KI |last7= Kang |first7= KS |title=Acupuncture for shoulder pain after stroke: A systematic review|journal=Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine 18(9):818-23.|date=September 2012|volume=18|issue=9|pages=213–8|doi=10.1089/acm.2011.0457|pmid= 22924414 |pmc= 3429280|display-authors= 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 systematic review found that acupuncture was not effective as a treatment for functional recovery after a stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kong|first1=J.

==== Children and pregnancy ====

When used on children, acupuncture is safe when administered by well-trained, licensed practitioners using sterile needles; however, there was limited research to draw definite conclusions about the overall safety of pediatric acupuncture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 2011&quot;/&gt; The same review found 279 adverse events, of which 25 were serious.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 2011&quot;/&gt; The adverse events were mostly mild in nature (e.g. bruising or bleeding).&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 2011&quot;/&gt; The prevalence of mild adverse events ranged from 10.1% to 13.5%, an estimated 168 incidences were among 1,422 patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 2011&quot;/&gt; On rare occasions adverse events were serious (e.g. [[cardiac rupture]] or [[hemoptysis]]), many might have been a result of substandard practice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=D|last2=Cheng|first2=F|last3=Jou|first3=H|last4=Aung|first4=S|last5=Yasui|first5=Y|last6=Vohra|first6=S|title=The safety of pediatric acupuncture: a systematic review.|journal=Pediatrics|date=Dec 2011|volume=128|issue=6|pages=e1575-87|pmid=22106073|doi=10.1542/peds.2011-1091}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The incidence of serious adverse events was 5 per one million, which included children and adults.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adams 2011&quot;/&gt; When used during pregnancy, the majority of adverse events caused by acupuncture were mild and transient, with few serious adverse events.&lt;ref name=Park-2014/&gt; The most frequent mild adverse event was needling or unspecified pain, followed by bleeding.&lt;ref name=Park-2014/&gt; Although two deaths (one stillbirth and one neonatal death) were reported, there was a lack of acupuncture associated maternal mortality.&lt;ref name=Park-2014/&gt; Limiting the evidence as certain, probable or possible in the causality evaluation, the estimated incidence of adverse events following acupuncture in pregnant women was 131 per 10,000.&lt;ref name=Park-2014&gt;{{cite journal |author=Park J1, Sohn Y, White AR, Lee H |title=The safety of acupuncture during pregnancy: a systematic review |journal=Acupunct Med |date=February 2014 |pmid=24554789 |doi=10.1136/acupmed-2013-010480 |type=Systematic review |volume=32 |issue=3 |pmc=4112450 |pages=257–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although acupuncture is not contraindicated in pregnant women, some specific acupuncture points that are particularly sensitive to needle insertion; these spots, as well as the [[abdomen|abdominal region]], should be avoided during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Berman2010/&gt;

&lt;!---=== Blood ===
TCM asserts that blood is propelled by qi, that the 100 blood &quot;vessels are the pathways of the blood’, that the vessels gather at a specific acupuncture point (Taiyuan LU-9) associated with the lung (or lungs), and that when qi flow is not in balance, blood pools and stagnates.&lt;ref&gt;Classic of Difficulties (45th Difficulty)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Classic of Categories&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=APDB&gt;{{cite web |title=Some Acupuncture Points Which Treat Disorders of Blood |author=Peter Deadman and Mazin Al-Khafaji |url= http://www.acupuncture.com/education/theory/ptsforblood.htm |publisher=acupuncture.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern science-based medicine has shown that blood is propelled by pumping action of the heart, and that there are many more than 100 blood vessels, that the vessels do not gather at that or any specific point, and that blood doesn't fail to circulate except by failure of pumping by the heart, and does not pool or stagnate except when a vessel is physically blocked or the heart pumping is disrupted.---&gt;

=== TCM concept of disease ===
{{See also|Traditional Chinese medicine#Concept of disease}}

In TCM, disease is generally perceived as a disharmony or imbalance in the functions or interactions of such concepts as [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Yin and yang|yin, yang]], [[Traditional Chinese medicine#TCM model of the body|qi, xuĕ, zàng-fǔ, meridians]],  and of the interaction between the body and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wiseman &amp; Ellis|1996|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therapy is based on which &quot;pattern of disharmony&quot; can be identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Ergil | first = MC | last2 = Ergil | first2 = KV | page = [http://books.google.com/books?id=kdZ1rFKW–LEC&amp;pg=PA19 19], [http://books.google.com/books?id=kdZ1rFKW–LEC&amp;pg=PA148 148] | title = Pocket Atlas of Chinese Medicine | year = 2009 | publisher = Thieme | location = Stuttgart | isbn = 9783131416117}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Flaws | first = B | author2 =Finney D | year = 2007 | title = A handbook of TCM patterns &amp; their treatments | edition = 6th | publisher = Blue Poppy Press | isbn = 9780936185705 | pages = [http://books.google.com/books?id=iJT3mz20yHoC&amp;pg=PA1 1] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the meridians, typical disease patterns are invasions with wind, cold, and damp Excesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Flaws |first1=B |last2=Finney |first2= D | title = A handbook of TCM patterns &amp; their treatments | publisher = Blue Poppy Press | year = 1996 | edition = 6 (2007) |isbn = 9780936185705 | pages = [http://books.google.ca/books?id=iJT3mz20yHoC&amp;pg=PA169#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 169–173] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to determine which [[Traditional chinese medicine#Patterns|pattern]] is at hand, practitioners will examine things like the color and shape of the tongue, the relative strength of pulse-points, the smell of the breath, the quality of breathing, or the sound of the voice.&lt;ref name = Tongue&gt;{{cite book | title = Tongue Diagnosis in Chinese Medicine | last = Maciocia | first = G  | publisher = Eastland Press | year = 1995 | isbn = 093961619X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Maciocia&gt;{{Cite book | first = G | last = Maciocia | title = The Foundations of Chinese Medicine | publisher = Churchill Livingstone | year = 2005 | isbn = 0443074895 }}&lt;/ref&gt; TCM and its concept of disease do not strongly differentiate between cause and effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| pages=[http://books.google.ca/books?id=t23zKB1FSVYC&amp;pg=PA26#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 26]| last=Ross |first=J|title=Zang Fu, the organ systems of traditional Chinese medicine| publisher=Elsevier |year=1984 | isbn=9780443034824 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, however, [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Considerations of disease causes|endogenous, exogenous and miscellaneous causes of disease]] are recognized.&lt;ref name=&quot;essentials&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=anon |title= Essentials of Chinese Acupuncture |publisher = Foreign Languages Press | location = Beijing | year = 1980 |edition = 1st |pages = 39–46 |isbn= |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Traditional diagnosis ===

The acupuncturist decides which points to treat by observing and questioning the patient to make a diagnosis according to the tradition used. In TCM, the four diagnostic methods are: inspection, ausculation and olfaction, inquiring, and palpation. Inspection focuses on the face and particularly on the tongue, including analysis of the tongue size, shape, tension, color and coating, and the absence or presence of teeth marks around the edge.&lt;ref name=Cheng1987/&gt; Auscultation and olfaction is listening for particular sounds (such as wheezing) and attending to body odor.&lt;ref name=Cheng1987/&gt; Inquiring is focusing on the &quot;seven inquiries&quot;: chills and fever; perspiration; appetite, thirst and taste; defecation and urination; pain; sleep; and [[menses]] and [[leukorrhea]].&lt;ref name=Cheng1987/&gt; Palpation is focusing on feeling the body for tender [[Acupuncture#Qi, meridians and acupuncture points|A-shi points]] and feeling the left and right radial pulses.&lt;ref name=Cheng1987&gt;[[#Cheng1987|Cheng]], 1987, chapter 12.&lt;/ref&gt; There is significant heterogeneity among acupuncturists considering appropriate treatment protocols.&lt;ref name=Langevin2011 /&gt;

==== Tongue and pulse ====

Examination of the tongue and the pulse are among the principal diagnostic methods in TCM. Certain sectors of the tongue's surface are believed to correspond to the zàng-fŭ. For example, teeth marks on one part of the tongue might indicate a problem with the heart, while teeth marks on another part of the tongue might indicate a problem with the liver.&lt;ref name = Tongue/&gt;

Pulse palpation involves measuring the pulse at a superficial and at a deep level at three locations on the radial artery (''Cun, Guan, Chi'', located two fingerbreadths from the wrist crease, one fingerbreadth from the wrist crease, and right at the wrist crease, respectively, usually palpated with the index, middle and ring finger) of each arm, for 12 pulses, all of which are thought to correspond with certain zàng-fŭ. The pulse is examined for several characteristics including rhythm, strength, and volume, and is described with qualities like &quot;floating, slippery, bolstering-like, feeble, thready and quick&quot;. Each of these qualities indicate certain [[Traditional Chinese medicine#Patterns|disease patterns]]. Training on the use of TCM pulse diagnosis can take several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Eisenberg, David |title=Encounters with Qi: exploring Chinese medicine |publisher=Norton |location=New York |year=1995 |pages= 260 |isbn=0393312135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Scientific view on TCM theory ===
[[File:Archie McPhee acupuncture.jpg|thumb|right|Modern acupuncture model]]

Some modern practitioners have embraced the use of acupuncture to treat pain, but have abandoned the use of ''qi'', meridians, ''yin'' and ''yang'' as explanatory frameworks.&lt;ref name=Mann2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peñas2010&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=de las Peñas |first1=César Fernández |last2=Arendt-Nielsen |first2=Lars |last3=Gerwin |first3=Robert D |title=Tension-type and cervicogenic headache: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management |publisher=[[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning]] |year =2010 |isbn=9780763752835 | pages =251–4 | url = http://books.google.ca/books?id=HpRwMB-cNCoC&amp;pg=PA251#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some practitioners no longer consider the idea of an energy flow to apply.&lt;ref name = Williams2013/&gt; They, along with acupuncture researchers, explain the analgesic effects of acupuncture as caused by the release of [[endorphins]], and recognize the lack of evidence that it can affect the course of any disease.&lt;ref name = Williams2013&gt;{{cite book | last = Williams | first = WF | title = Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience: From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy | isbn = 1135955220 | work = [[Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience]] | publisher = [[Routledge]] | year = 2013 | pages = 3–4 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=vH1EAgAAQBAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Ulett2002&gt;{{cite book | last = Ulett | first = GA | title = The Skeptic: Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience | publisher = [[ABC-CLIO]] | editor = [[Michael Shermer|Shermer, M]] | isbn = 1576076539 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=Gr4snwg7iaEC&amp;pg=PA283#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | pages = 283–91 | chapter = Acupuncture | year = 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 review stated that despite ample controversy encircling the validity of acupuncture as a modality, developing literature on its physiological effects in animals and humans is giving new views into the basic mechanisms for acupuncture needling.&lt;ref name=Langevin2014/&gt; The same review proposed a model combining both connective tissue plasticity and peripheral sensory modulation as a needle response for acupuncture's physiological effects.&lt;ref name=Langevin2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Langevin|first1=Helene M.|title=Acupuncture, Connective Tissue, and Peripheral Sensory Modulation|journal=Critical Reviews in Eukaryotic Gene Expression|volume=24|issue=3|year=2014|pages=249–253|issn=1045-4403|doi=10.1615/CritRevEukaryotGeneExpr.2014008284|pmid=25072149}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence indicates that acupuncture-induced pain relief effect has physiological, anatomical and neurochemical origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhao|first1=Zhi-Qi|title=Neural mechanism underlying acupuncture analgesia|journal=Progress in Neurobiology|volume=85|issue=4|year=2008|pages=355–375|issn=03010082|doi=10.1016/j.pneurobio.2008.05.004|pmid=18582529}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism of action for acupuncture is still unclear.&lt;ref name=Wang2008/&gt; Evidence suggests that acupuncture generates a sequence of events that include the release of [[opioid#Endogenous opioids|endogenous opioid]]-like substances that modulate pain signals within the [[central nervous system]].&lt;ref name=Wang2008&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Shu-Ming|last2=Kain|first2=Zeev N.|last3=White|first3=Paul|title=Acupuncture Analgesia: I.

Korea is believed to be the second country that acupuncture spread to outside of China.&lt;ref name=Needham2002/&gt; Within Korea there is a legend that acupuncture was developed by the legendary emperor [[Dangun]] though it is more likely to have been brought into Korea from a Chinese colonial prefecture.&lt;ref name=Needham2002&gt;[[#Needham2002|Needham &amp; Lu]], 2002, p.

Around 90 works on acupuncture were written in China between the Han Dynasty and the [[Song Dynasty]], and the [[Emperor Renzong of Song]], in 1023, ordered the production of a bronze statuette (''Dongren'') depicting the meridians and acupuncture points then in use.&lt;ref name=Needham2002/&gt; However, after the end of the Song Dynasty, acupuncture lost status, and started to be seen as a technical profession, in comparison to the more scholarly profession of herbalism.&lt;ref name=Barnes2005/&gt; It became rarer in the following centuries, and was associated with less prestigious practices like [[alchemy]], [[shamanism]], [[midwifery]] and moxibustion.&lt;ref name=Barnes2005&gt;[[#Barnes2005|Barnes]], 2005, p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA25 25].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] missionaries in the 16th century were among the first to bring reports of acupuncture to the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Unschuld | first = P | title = Chinese Medicine | page = 94 | year = 1998 | publisher = Paradigm Publications | isbn = 0912111550 }}based on {{cite journal |last1=Michel|first1=Wolfgang |volume=354|pages=194–222|title=Frühe westliche Beobachtungen zur Akupunktur und Moxibustion [Early Western Observations on Acupuncture and Moxibustion] |year=1993 |journal=Sudhoffs Archiv.

In 1674, Hermann Buschoff, a Dutch priest in Batavia, published the first book on moxibustion (from Japanese ''mogusa'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michel, Wolfgang, Michel-Zaitsu, Wolfgang |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2324/2936 |title=Collections &amp;#124; Kyushu University Library |publisher=Hdl.handle.net |date= |accessdate=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first elaborate Western treatise on acupuncture was published in 1683 by [[Willem ten Rhijne]], a Dutch physician who had worked at the Dutch trading post [[Dejima]] in [[Nagasaki]] for two years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Barnes2005|Barnes]], 2005, p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA75 75].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1712 a detailed description of the treatment of &quot;Colics&quot; in Japan was published by the German physician Engelbert Kaempfer. But while moxibustion was widely discussed among central European physicians, ten Rhijne's and especially Kaempfer's explanations about piercing the abdomen had caused some misunderstandings that eventually led to the refutal of acupuncture by influential scholars such as [[Lorenz Heister]] and [[Georg Stahl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Michel|first1=Wolfgang |volume=20|pages=67–82|title=Far Eastern Medicine in Seventeenth and Early Eighteenth Century Germany |year=2004|journal=Studies in Languages and Cultures |doi=10.2307/20777697|ISSN=0039-4564|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2324/2878 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1757 the Chinese physician Xu Daqun described the further decline of acupuncture, saying it was a lost art, with few experts to instruct; its decline was attributed in part to the popularity of prescriptions and medications, as well as its association with the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Barnes2005|Barnes]], 2005, p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA188 188].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1822, an edict from the Emperor Daoguang banned the practice and teaching of acupuncture within the Imperial Academy of Medicine outright, as unfit for practice by gentlemen-scholars.&lt;ref name=Barnes308/&gt; At this point, acupuncture was still cited in Europe with both skepticism and praise, with little study and only a small amount of experimentation.&lt;ref name=Barnes308&gt;[[#Barnes2005|Barnes]], 2005, pp. [http://books.google.com/books?id=jU0JMNtGWnIC&amp;pg=PA308 308–9].&lt;/ref&gt;

While the details of how acupuncture came to Europe are debated, the French doctor Louis Berlioz (the father of the composer [[Hector Berlioz]]) is usually credited with first experimenting the procedure in 1810, before publishing his findings in 1816.&lt;ref name=Barnes308/&gt; In the United States, the earliest reports of acupuncture date back to 1826, when [[Benjamin Franklin Bache|Franklin Bache]], a surgeon of the [[United States Navy]], published a report in the ''North American Medical and Surgical Journal'' on his use of acupuncture to treat lower back pain.&lt;ref name=&quot;nciacupuncture&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Acupuncture (PDQ®)|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq/cam/acupuncture/healthprofessional/page3|publisher=[[National Cancer Institute]]|accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the beginning of the 19th century, acupuncture was practiced by Asian immigrants living in [[Chinatown]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;nciacupuncture&quot;/&gt;

=== Modern era ===

In the early years after the [[Chinese Civil War]], [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] leaders ridiculed traditional Chinese medicine, including acupuncture, as [[superstitious]], [[irrational]] and backward, claiming that it conflicted with the Party's dedication to science as the way of progress.&lt;ref name=Crozier1968/&gt; Communist Party Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] later reversed this position, saying that &quot;Chinese medicine and pharmacology are a great treasure house and efforts should be made to explore them and raise them to a higher level.&quot;&lt;ref name=Crozier1968&gt;{{cite book |author=Crozier RC |title= Traditional medicine in modern China: science, nationalism, and the tensions of cultural change |edition=1 |publisher= [[Harvard University Press]] |location= Cambridge |year=1968 |isbn=978-0674901056 |oclc= }}{{Page needed|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Mao's leadership, in response to the lack of modern medical practitioners, acupuncture was revived and its theory rewritten to adhere to the political, economic and logistic necessities of providing for the medical needs of China's population. Despite Mao proclaiming the practice of Chinese medicine to be &quot;scientific&quot;, the practice was based more on the [[Materialism|materialist]] assumptions of [[Marxism]] in opposition to superstition rather than the [[Western culture|Western]] practice of empirical investigation of nature.&lt;ref name=Taylor2011/&gt; Later the 1950s TCM's theory was again rewritten at Mao's insistence as a political response to the lack of unity between scientific and traditional Chinese medicine, and to correct the supposed &quot;bourgeois thought of Western doctors of medicine&quot;.&lt;ref name=Taylor2011&gt;{{cite book | last = Taylor | first = K | title = Chinese Medicine in Early Communist China, 1945–63: a Medicine of Revolution | year = 2005 | isbn = 041534512X | publisher = RoutledgeCurzon |page= 109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite publicly promoting the practice, Mao himself did not believe in or use traditional Chinese medicine.&lt;ref name = Privatelife&gt;{{cite book | last = Li | first = Zhi-Sui | title = [[The Private Life of Chairman Mao]] | publisher = [[Random House]] | pages = [http://books.google.com/books?id=VyU6fwmdjf8C&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 84] | year = 2011 | isbn = 0307791394 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acupuncture gained attention in the United States when the U.S. President [[1972 Nixon visit to China|Richard Nixon visited China in 1972]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CSICOP&quot;/&gt; During one part of the visit, the delegation was shown a patient undergoing major surgery while fully awake, ostensibly receiving acupuncture rather than [[anesthesia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CSICOP&quot;/&gt; Later it was found that the patients selected for the surgery had both a high [[pain tolerance]] and received heavy indoctrination before the operation; these demonstration cases were also frequently receiving [[morphine]] surreptitiously through an [[intravenous therapy|intravenous drip]] that observers were told contained only fluids and nutrients.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSICOP&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.csicop.org/si/show/china_conference_1/ | title = Traditional Medicine and Pseudoscience in China: A Report of the Second CSICOP Delegation (Part 1) | first = BL | last = Beyerstein | author2 = Sampson W | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | year = 1996 | journal = [[Skeptical Inquirer]] | publisher = [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; One patient receiving [[open heart surgery]] while awake was ultimately found to have received a combination of three powerful sedatives as well as large injections of a [[local anesthetic]] into the wound.&lt;ref name = Colquhoun2013/&gt;

The greatest exposure in the West came after ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter [[James Reston]] received acupuncture in Beijing for post-operative pain in 1971 and wrote complaisantly about it in his newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Davidson JP |title=The complete idiot's guide to managing stress |publisher=Alpha Books |location=Indianapolis, Ind |year=1999 |pages= [http://books.google.ca/books?id=ldtNvjS7ypcC&amp;pg=PA255#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 255]|isbn=0028629558 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972 the first legal acupuncture center in the U.S. was established in Washington DC; during 1973-1974, this center saw up to one thousand patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;JCIM_Lee&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.jcimjournal.com/en/index.aspx/ | title = The first acupuncture center in the United States: an interview with Dr. Yao Wu Lee, Washington Acupuncture Center | first = AY | last = Fan | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | year = 2012 | journal = [[Journal of Integrative Medicine]] | publisher = Committee for Journal of Chinese Integrative Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973 the American [[Internal Revenue Service]] allowed acupuncture to be deducted as a medical expense.&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 133&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York City|isbn= 0465041957|page= 133|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acupuncture has been the subject of active scientific research both in regard to its basis and therapeutic effectiveness since the late 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17265547&quot;/&gt; Even though acupuncture is currently widely used in clinical practice, it remains a controversial topic.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17265547&quot;/&gt; In 2006, a [[BBC]] documentary ''Alternative Medicine'' filmed a patient undergoing open heart surgery allegedly under acupuncture-induced anesthesia. It was later revealed that the patient had been given a cocktail of weak anesthetics that in combination could have a much more powerful effect. The program was also criticized for its fanciful interpretation of the results of a brain scanning experiment.&lt;ref name=SinghGuardian&gt;{{cite news | title= A groundbreaking experiment ... or a sensationalized TV stunt?|author=Simon Singh|work=The Guardian |date=26 March 2006|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/mar/25/science.broadcasting}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SinghTelegraph&gt;{{cite news|title=Did we really witness the 'amazing power' of acupuncture?|work=Daily Telegraph |date=14 February 2006|author=Simon Singh|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3344833/Did-we-really-witness-the-amazing-power-of-acupuncture.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, acupuncture was recognized by [[UNESCO]] as part of the world's [[intangible cultural heritage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Acupuncture and moxibustion of traditional Chinese medicine|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/RL/00425|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethics ==

The [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) consensus statement and conference that produced it in 1997 were criticized by [[Wallace Sampson]], founder of the ''[[Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine]]'', writing for an affiliated publication of Quackwatch who stated the meeting was chaired by a strong proponent of acupuncture and failed to include speakers who had obtained negative results on studies of acupuncture. Sampson also stated he believed the report showed evidence of pseudoscientific reasoning.&lt;ref name = QuackwatchSampson&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.acuwatch.org/general/nihcritique.shtml | last = Sampson | first = W | title = Critique of the NIH Consensus Conference on Acupuncture | publisher = Quackwatch | accessdate = 5 June 2009 | date = 23 March 2005| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090606155216/http://www.acuwatch.org/general/nihcritique.shtml| archivedate= 6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2003 [[World Health Organization]]'s (WHO) report was controversial; critics assailed it as being problematic since, in spite of the disclaimer, supporters used it to claim that the WHO endorsed acupuncture that were lacking sufficient evidence-basis.&lt;ref name=&quot; Lancet_WHO_2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McCarthy |first1=Michael |title=Critics slam draft WHO report on homoeopathy |journal=The Lancet |volume=366 |issue=9487|pages=705–6 |year=2005 |pmid=16130229 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)67159-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical scientists expressed concern that the evidence supporting acupuncture outlined in the report was weak, and [[Wim Betz|Willem Betz]] of [[SKEPP]] (Studie Kring voor Kritische Evaluatie van Pseudowetenschap en het Paranormale, the Study Circle for the Critical Evaluation of Pseudoscience and the Paranormal) said that the report was evidence that the &quot;WHO has been infiltrated by missionaries for alternative medicine&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancet_WHO_2005&quot;/&gt; The WHO 2003 report was also criticized in the 2008 book ''[[Trick or Treatment]]'' for, in addition to being produced by a panel that included no critics of acupuncture, containing two major errors – including too many results from low-quality [[clinical trial]]s, and including a large number of trials originating in China where, probably due to publication bias, no negative trials have ever been produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;TorT277&quot;/&gt; Ernst and Singh, the authors of the book, described the report as &quot;highly misleading&quot; and a &quot;shoddy piece of work that was never rigorously scrutinized&quot; and stated that the results of high-quality clinical trials do not support the use of acupuncture to treat anything but pain and nausea.&lt;ref name = &quot;TorT277&quot;&gt;[[#Singh2008|Singh &amp; Ernst]], 2008, p. [http://books.google.com/books?id=bZjlC2LELlIC&amp;pg=PA277 277-8].&lt;/ref&gt; Ernst also described the statement in a 2006 peer reviewed article as &quot;[p]erhaps the most obviously over-optimistic overview [of acupuncture]&quot;, noting that of the 35 conditions that the WHO stated acupuncture was effective for, 27 of the systematic reviews that the WHO report was based on found that acupuncture was not effective for treating the specified condition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ernst2006&quot;/&gt;

Placebos have been used in [[medical care]] to treat the elderly.&lt;ref name=Cherniack2010/&gt; For example, a response to &quot;sham&quot; acupuncture in osteoarthritis may be used in the elderly.&lt;ref name=Cherniack2010/&gt; Placebos have usually been regarded as deception and thus unethical.&lt;ref name=Cherniack2010/&gt; However, some physicians and ethicists have suggested circumstances for applicable uses for placebos such as it might present a theoretical advantage of an inexpensive treatment without adverse reactions or interactions with drugs or other medications.&lt;ref name=Cherniack2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cherniack|first1=E Paul|title=Would the elderly be better off if they were given more placebos?|journal=Geriatrics &amp; Gerontology International|year=2010|issn=14441586|doi=10.1111/j.1447-0594.2009.00580.x|pmid=20100289|volume=10|issue=2|pages=131–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acupuncture is a commonly used alternative medicine modality.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Posadzki2012/&gt;--&gt; Many physicians in the UK appear to recommend alternative medicine, which raises ethical issues.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Posadzki2012/&gt;--&gt; Physicians have a duty of care requiring that each patient be treated with the best treatment for a given condition and situation.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Posadzki2012/&gt;--&gt; As the evidence for most types of alternative medicine is far from strong, the use of alternative medicine in regular healthcare can present an ethical question.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Posadzki2012/&gt;--&gt; A large proportion of physicians in the UK appear to employ some type of alternative medicine, but many have not received the relevant training, which raises issues associated with [[medical ethics]] and professional competence.&lt;ref name=Posadzki2012&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Posadzki|first1=P.|last2=Alotaibi|first2=A.|last3=Ernst|first3=E.|title=Prevalence of use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) by physicians in the UK: a systematic review of surveys|journal=Clinical Medicine|volume=12|issue=6|year=2012|pages=505–512|issn=1470-2118|doi=10.7861/clinmedicine.12-6-505|pmid=23342401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to David Gorski, &quot;What [[Brian Berman|Berman]] is doing in this article in the NEJM is the same thing that CAM advocates in general and acupuncture apologists in particular have a maddening tendency to do. They either cherry pick studies that appear to indicate that their favored woo works. When, as Berman ''et al'' were, they are forced to admit that well-designed studies with lots of patients show that their woo is no better than a valid placebo control, they then shift to embracing the placebo, to owning it, so to speak, all without actually calling it placebo&quot;.&lt;ref name=Gorski2010&gt;{{cite web|title=Credulity about acupuncture infiltrates the ''New England Journal of Medicine''|author=[[David Gorski]]|publisher=Science-based Medicine|url=http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=6381|date=August 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acupuncture is perceptibly used at academic medical centers despite little or no convincing scientific evidence for explicit effects for any condition that is discernible from placebo.&lt;ref name=Gorski2014/&gt; The evidence that the majority of CAM modalities, such as acupuncture, are little more than 'theatrical placebos' is so compelling that some proponents of acupuncture have essentially conceded this position by advocating the 'harnessing of placebo effects' or developing 'meaningful placebos'.&lt;ref name=Gorski2014&gt;{{cite  journal|last1=Gorski|first1=David H.|title=Integrative oncology: really the best of both worlds?|journal=[[Nature Reviews Cancer]]|year=2014|issn=1474-175X|doi=10.1038/nrc3822|pmid=25230880}}&lt;/ref&gt;
