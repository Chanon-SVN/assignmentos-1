'''Alcoholism''' is a broad term for problems with [[ethanol]] (commonly referred to as alcohol), and generally refers to alcohol [[addiction]], which is the [[compulsive behavior|compulsive]] and uncontrolled consumption of [[alcoholic beverage]]s, usually to the detriment of the drinker's health, personal relationships, and social standing. It is medically considered a [[Disease theory of alcoholism|disease]], specifically an addictive illness. In psychiatry several other terms have been used, specifically &quot;[[alcohol abuse]]&quot;, &quot;[[alcohol dependence]],&quot; and &quot;alcohol use disorder&quot; which have slightly different definitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlDiagnostic Criteria for Alcohol Abuse and Dependence - Alcohol Alert No. 30-1995&quot;/&gt; Alcohol misuse has the potential to damage almost every organ in the body, including the brain. The cumulative toxic effects of chronic alcohol abuse can cause both medical and psychiatric problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor1-first=Woody |editor1-last=Caan |editor2-first=Jackie de |editor2-last=Belleroche |title=Drink, Drugs and Dependence: From Science to Clinical Practice |url=http://books.google.com/?id=nPvbDUw4w5QC |edition=1st |date=11 April 2002 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-27891-1 |pages=19–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; One who has alcoholism is called an alcoholic.

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis--&gt;
The American Medical Association considers alcoholism as a disease&lt;ref&gt;AMA [http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/PolicyFinder/policyfiles/HnE/H-95.983.HTM Policy H-95.983 Drug Dependencies as Diseases]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AMA [http://www.ama-assn.org/resources/doc/hod/a08csaphreports.pdf Reports of the Council on Science and Public Health: Substance Use and Substance Use Disorders] AMA 2008 Annual meeting&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|452}} and supports a classification that includes both physical and mental components.&lt;ref&gt;AMA [http://www.ama-assn.org/ad-com/polfind/Hlth-Ethics.pdf Health And Ethics Policies of the AMA House Of Delegates] Quote: &quot;H-30.997 Dual Disease Classification of Alcoholism: The AMA reaffirms its policy endorsing the dual classification of alcoholism under both the psychiatric and medical sections of the

These changes maintain the person with alcoholism's compulsive inability to stop drinking and result in [[alcohol withdrawal syndrome]] if the person stops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman-1996&quot;/&gt; Identifying alcoholism may be difficult for those affected because of the [[social stigma]] associated with the disease that causes people with alcoholism to avoid diagnosis and treatment for fear of shame or social consequences. The evaluation responses to a group of standardized questioning is a common method of diagnosis. These can be used to identify harmful drinking patterns, including alcoholism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kahan-1996&quot;/&gt; In general, problem drinking is considered alcoholism when the person continues to drink despite experiencing social or health problems caused by drinking.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSMIV&quot;/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
Treatment of alcoholism takes several steps.  Because of the medical problems that can be caused by withdrawal, [[alcohol detoxification]] should be carefully controlled. One common method involves the administration of [[benzodiazepine]] medications, such as [[diazepam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Blondell-2005&quot;/&gt; People with alcoholism also sometimes have other addictions which may complicate this step.&lt;ref name=&quot;dolpdaa&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Johansson BA, Berglund M, Hanson M, Pöhlén C, Persson I | title = Dependence on legal psychotropic drugs among alcoholics | journal = Alcohol Alcohol. | volume = 38 | issue = 6 | pages = 613–8 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14633651 | doi = 10.1093/alcalc/agg123 | url = http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/38/6/613 | format = PDF | issn = 0735-0414 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After detoxification, other support such as group therapy or self-help groups are used to help the person remain sober.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan-Lopez-2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Soyka-2001&quot;/&gt; Thombs (1999) states according to behavioural sciences alcoholism is described as a “maladaptive behaviour”. He explains this must not be confused with “misbehaviour”. Behavioural scientists explain that addicts have a behaviour pattern that may lead to destructive consequences for themselves, their families and society. This does not label addicts as bad or irresponsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thombs|first=Dennis L. Thombs|title=Introduction To Addictive Behaviors 2ed|year=1999|publisher=The Guildford Press|location=London|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with men, women are more sensitive to alcohol's harmful physical, cerebral, and mental effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walter H., Gutierrez K., Ramskogler K., Hertling I., Dvorak A., Lesch O.M., et al. 2003 253–268&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Walter H, Gutierrez K, Ramskogler K, Hertling I, Dvorak A, Lesch OM | title = Gender-specific differences in alcoholism: implications for treatment. | journal = Archives of Women's Mental Health | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 253–8 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14628177 | doi = 10.1007/s00737-003-0014-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology, Society and Culture --&gt;
In 1979, an expert [[World Health Organization]] committee discouraged the use of &quot;alcoholism&quot; in medicine, preferring the category of &quot;alcohol dependence syndrome&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ladtpwho&quot;/&gt; In the 19th and early 20th centuries, alcohol dependence in general was called [[dipsomania]], but that term now has a much more specific meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Tracy | first1 = Sarah J. | title = Alcoholism in America: from reconstruction to prohibition | url = http://books.google.com/?id=JkYyd4qmme0C&amp;pg=PA31 | date = 25 May 2005 | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | location = Baltimore | isbn = 978-0-8018-8119-0 | pages = 31–52 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other terms, some of them [[Pejorative|insulting]] or [[slang|informal]], have been used throughout history.  The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that there are 140 million people with alcoholism worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;whoemcoypaa&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;whotmbcrtdhrai&quot;/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==

===Early signs===
The risk of alcohol dependence begins at low levels of drinking and increases directly with both the volume of alcohol consumed and a pattern of drinking larger amounts on an occasion. Young adults are particularly at risk.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ias.org.uk/resources/papers/europe/phproject/bingedrinking-report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-term misuse===
[[File:Possible long-term effects of ethanol.svg|thumb|400px|Some of the possible [[long-term effects of ethanol]] an individual may develop. Additionally, in pregnant women, alcohol can cause [[fetal alcohol syndrome]].]]
Alcoholism is characterised by an increased [[Alcohol tolerance|tolerance]] of and [[physical dependence]] on alcohol, affecting an individual's ability to control alcohol consumption safely. These characteristics are believed to play a role in impeding an alcoholic's ability to stop drinking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman-1996&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hoffman PL, Tabakoff B | title = Alcohol dependence: a commentary on mechanisms | journal = Alcohol Alcohol | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 333–40 | date = July 1996 | pmid = 8879279 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.alcalc.a008159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health, causing psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide. A [[Depression (mood)|depressed mood]] is a common symptom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dunn N, Cook CC | title = Psychiatric aspects of alcohol misuse | journal = Hospital medicine (London, England : 1998) | volume = 60 | issue = 3 | pages = 169–72 | date = March 1999 | pmid = 10476237 | issn = 1462-3935 | doi=10.12968/hosp.1999.60.3.1060}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;drug_abuse_prevention_a03&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=Richard |last2=Kolander |first2=Cheryl A. |title=Drug abuse prevention: a school and community partnership |year=2003 |publisher=Jones and Bartlett |location=Sudbury, Mass. |url=http://books.google.com/?id=Cm1MfcBSucUC |isbn=978-0-7637-1461-1 |pages=40–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Physical====
Long-term alcohol abuse can cause a number of physical symptoms, including [[cirrhosis]] of the liver, [[pancreatitis]], [[epilepsy]], [[polyneuropathy]], [[Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome|alcoholic dementia]], heart disease, nutritional deficiencies, [[Duodenal ulcer|peptic ulcers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=American Medical Association |title=Complete Medical Encyclopedia |year=2003|publisher=Random House Reference |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-8129-9100-1|edition=First |authorlink=Duodenal Ulcer |editor=Leiken, Jerrold B. MD, Lipsky, Martin S. MD |accessdate=2 December 2011 |page=485 |type=Encyclopeia}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sexual dysfunction]], and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing [[cardiovascular disease]], [[malabsorption]], [[alcoholic liver disease]], and [[cancer]]. Damage to the [[central nervous system]] and [[peripheral nervous system]] can occur from sustained alcohol consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Müller D, Koch RD, von Specht H, Völker W, Münch EM | title = [Neurophysiologic findings in chronic alcohol abuse] | language = German | journal = Psychiatr Neurol Med Psychol (Leipz) | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 129–32 | date = March 1985 | pmid = 2988001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Testino G | title = Alcoholic diseases in hepato-gastroenterology: a point of view | journal = Hepatogastroenterology | volume = 55 | issue = 82–83 | pages = 371–7 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18613369 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A wide range of immunologic defects can result and there may be a generalized skeletal fragility, in addition to a recognized tendency to accidental injury, resulting a propensity to bone fractures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/10report/intro.pdf 10th Special Report to the U.S. Congress on Alcohol and Health], 2000, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women develop long-term complications of alcohol dependence more rapidly than do men. Additionally, women have a higher mortality rate from alcoholism than men.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blume Laura N., Nielson Nancy H., Riggs Joseph A., et all 1998 861–870&quot;/&gt; Examples of long-term complications include brain, heart, and liver damage&lt;ref name=&quot;Walter H., Gutierrez K., Ramskogler K., Hertling I., Dvorak A., Lesch O.M., et al. 2003 253–268&quot; /&gt; and an [[alcohol and breast cancer|increased risk of breast cancer]]. Additionally, heavy drinking over time has been found to have a negative effect on reproductive functioning in women. This results in reproductive dysfunction such as [[anovulation]], decreased ovarian mass, problems or irregularity of the [[menstrual cycle]], and early [[menopause]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Blume Laura N., Nielson Nancy H., Riggs Joseph A., et all 1998 861–870&quot; /&gt; Alcoholic [[ketoacidosis]] can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a recent history of [[binge drinking]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mihai-&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mihai B, Lăcătuşu C, Graur M | title = [Alcoholic ketoacidosis] | journal = Rev Med Chir Soc Med Nat Iasi | volume = 112 | issue = 2 | pages = 321–6 | date = April–June 2008 | pmid = 19294998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sibaï-2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sibaï K, Eggimann P | title = [Alcoholic ketoacidosis: not rare cause of metabolic acidosis] | journal = Rev Med Suisse | volume = 1 | issue = 32 | pages = 2106, 2108–10, 2112–5 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16238232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psychiatric====
Long-term misuse of alcohol can cause a wide range of mental health problems. Severe [[cognitive]] problems are common; approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to alcohol consumption, making it the second leading cause of dementia.&lt;ref name=&quot;aamaibnc&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-07/econ-ma070808.php |title=Alcoholism-associated molecular adaptations in brain neurocognitive circuits |author=Professor Georgy Bakalkin |date=8 July 2008 |publisher=eurekalert.org

[[Social skills]] are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the [[prefrontal cortex]] area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by [[alcohol abuse]] include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] perception problems and [[theory of mind]] deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid18412750&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Uekermann J, Daum I | title = Social cognition in alcoholism: a link to prefrontal cortex dysfunction? | journal = Addiction | volume = 103 | issue = 5 | pages = 726–35 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18412750 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2008.02157.x | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatric disorders are common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances. The most prevalent psychiatric symptoms are [[anxiety]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] disorders. Psychiatric symptoms usually initially worsen during alcohol withdrawal, but typically improve or disappear with continued abstinence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wetterling T, Junghanns K | title = Psychopathology of alcoholics during withdrawal and early abstinence | journal = Eur Psychiatry | volume = 15 | issue = 8 | pages = 483–8 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 11175926 | doi = 10.1016/S0924-9338(00)00519-8 | issn = 0924-9338 | first2 = K | last2 = Junghanns }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Psychosis]], [[confusion]], and [[organic brain syndrome]] may be caused by alcohol misuse, which can lead to a misdiagnosis such as [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schuckit MA | title = Alcoholism and other psychiatric disorders | journal = Hosp Community Psychiatry | volume = 34 | issue = 11 | pages = 1022–7 | date = November 1983 | pmid = 6642446 | issn = 0022-1597 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Panic disorder]] can develop or worsen as a direct result of long-term alcohol misuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cowley DS | title = Alcohol abuse, substance abuse, and panic disorder | journal = Am J Med | volume = 92 | issue = 1A | pages = 41S–48S | date = 24 January 1992 | pmid = 1346485 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9343(92)90136-Y | issn = 0002-9343 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cosci F, Schruers KR, Abrams K, Griez EJ | title = Alcohol use disorders and panic disorder: a review of the evidence of a direct relationship | journal = J Clin Psychiatry | volume = 68 | issue = 6 | pages = 874–80 | date = June 2007 | pmid = 17592911 | doi = 10.4088/JCP.v68n0608 | issn = 0160-6689 | first2 = KR | last3 = Abrams | last2 = Schruers | first3 = K }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatric disorders differ depending on gender. Women who have alcohol-use disorders often have a co-occurring psychiatric diagnosis such as major depression, anxiety, panic disorder, [[bulimia]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), or [[borderline personality disorder]]. Men with alcohol-use disorders more often have a co-occurring diagnosis of [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] or [[antisocial personality disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], schizophrenia, impulse disorders or [[attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Karrol Brad R. 2002 337–356&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Karrol Brad R. |title=Women and alcohol use disorders: a review of important knowledge and its implications for social work practitioners |journal=Journal of social work |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=337–356 |year=2002 |doi=10.1177/146801730200200305 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Women with alcoholism are more likely to have a history of physical or sexual assault, abuse and domestic violence than those in the general population,&lt;ref name=&quot;Karrol Brad R. 2002 337–356&quot; /&gt; which can lead to higher instances of psychiatric disorders and greater dependence on alcohol.

====Social effects====
{{See also|Drug-related crime}}

The social problems arising from alcoholism are serious, caused by the pathological changes in the brain and the intoxicating effects of alcohol.&lt;ref name=&quot;aamaibnc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jessica Kingsley Publishers&quot;/&gt; Alcohol abuse is associated with an increased risk of committing criminal offences, including [[child abuse]], [[domestic violence]], [[rape]], [[burglary]] and [[assault]].&lt;ref name=&quot;drug_use_a_reference_handbook&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Isralowitz | first1 = Richard | title = Drug use: a reference handbook | url = http://books.google.com/?id=X0mxxfbIbp4C | year = 2004 | publisher = ABC-CLIO | location = Santa Barbara, Calif. | isbn = 978-1-57607-708-5 | pages = 122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcoholism is associated with [[termination of employment|loss of employment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Langdana | first1 = Farrokh K. | title = Macroeconomic Policy: Demystifying Monetary and Fiscal Policy | url = http://books.google.com/?id=GCYWQn79JYwC | date = 27 March 2009 | publisher = Springer | edition = 2nd | isbn = 978-0-387-77665-1 | page = 81 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which can lead to financial problems. Drinking at inappropriate times, and behavior caused by reduced judgment, can lead to legal consequences, such as criminal charges for [[drunk driving]]&lt;ref name=&quot;abd2009&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Gifford | first1 = Maria | title = Alcoholism (Biographies of Disease) | date = 22 October 2009 | publisher = Greenwood Press | url = http://books.google.com/?id=2OJV12astRUC | isbn = 978-0-313-35908-8 | pages = 89–91 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or public disorder, or civil penalties for [[tort]]ious behavior, and may lead to a criminal sentence.

An alcoholic's behavior and mental impairment, while drunk, can profoundly affect those surrounding them and lead to isolation from family and friends. This isolation can lead to [[relational disorder|marital conflict]] and [[divorce]], or contribute to [[domestic violence]]. Alcoholism can also lead to [[child neglect]], with subsequent lasting damage to the emotional development of the alcoholic's children.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcemh2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Schadé |first1=Johannes Petrus |title=The Complete Encyclopedia of Medicine and Health |date=October 2006 |publisher=Foreign Media Books |url=http://books.google.com/?id=j8DuEHxSCU4C |isbn=978-1-60136-001-4 |pages=132–133 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, children of alcoholic parents can develop a number of emotional problems. For example, they can become afraid of their parents, because of their unstable mood behaviors. In addition, they can develop considerable amount of shame over their inadequacy to liberate their parents from alcoholism. As a result of this failure, they develop wretched self-images, which can lead to depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gold |first=Mark |title=Children of Alcoholics |url=http://psychcentral.com/lib/2006/children-of-alcoholics/ |publisher=Psych Central |accessdate=27 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with similar substances with a sedative-hypnotic mechanism, such as [[barbiturates]] and [[benzodiazepines]], withdrawal from alcohol dependence can be fatal if it is not properly managed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jessica Kingsley Publishers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Galanter |first1=Marc |last2=Kleber |first2=Herbert D. |title=The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Substance Abuse Treatment |url=http://books.google.com/?id=6wdJgejlQzYC |edition=4th |date=1 July 2008 |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing Inc |location=United States of America |isbn=978-1-58562-276-4 |page=58 |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcohol's primary effect is the increase in stimulation of the [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]], promoting [[central nervous system]] depression. With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol, these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number, resulting in [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] and [[physical dependence]]. When alcohol consumption is stopped too abruptly, the person's nervous system suffers from uncontrolled [[synapse]] firing. This can result in symptoms that include [[anxiety]], life-threatening [[seizure]]s, [[delirium tremens]], hallucinations, shakes and possible [[heart failure]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Medical toxicology&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Dart |first1=Richard C. |title=Medical Toxicology |url=http://books.google.com/?id=qDf3AO8nILoC |edition=3rd |date=1 December 2003 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=USA |isbn=978-0-7817-2845-4 |pages=139–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Idemudia SO, Bhadra S, Lal H | title = The pentylenetetrazol-like interoceptive stimulus produced by ethanol withdrawal is potentiated by bicuculline and picrotoxinin | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–22 | date = June 1989 | pmid = 2742726 | doi = 10.1016/0893-133X(89)90014-6 | url =  | type =  | issn = 0893-133X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other neurotransmitter systems are also involved, especially [[dopamine]], [[NMDA]] and [[glutamate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman-1996&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chastain G | title = Alcohol, neurotransmitter systems, and behavior | journal = The Journal of general psychology | volume = 133 | issue = 4 | pages = 329–35 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17128954 | doi = 10.3200/GENP.133.4.329-335 | issn = 0022-1309 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Severe acute withdrawal symptoms such as [[delirium tremens]] and seizures rarely occur after 1 week post cessation of alcohol. The acute withdrawal phase can be defined as lasting between one and three weeks. In the period of 3 – 6 weeks following cessation increased anxiety, depression as well as sleep disturbance is common;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20148778&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Heilig M, Egli M, Crabbe JC, Becker HC | title = Acute withdrawal, protracted abstinence and negative affect in alcoholism: are they linked? | journal = Addict Biol | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–84 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20148778 | pmc = 3268458 | doi = 10.1111/j.1369-1600.2009.00194.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; fatigue and tension can persist for up to 5 weeks as part of the [[post-acute withdrawal syndrome]]; about a quarter of alcoholics experience anxiety and depression for up to 2 years.

Individuals who have had multiple withdrawal episodes are more likely to develop seizures and experience more severe anxiety during withdrawal from alcohol than alcohol dependent individuals without a history of past alcohol withdrawal episodes.

There are decision tools and questionnaires which help guide physicians in evaluating alcohol withdrawal. For example, the CIWA-Ar objectifies alcohol withdrawal symptoms in order to guide therapy decisions which allows for an efficient interview while at the same time retaining clinical usefulness, validity and reliability, ensuring proper care for withdrawal patients, who can be in danger of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sullivan JT, Sykora K, Schneiderman J, Naranjo CA, Sellers EM. | title = Assessment of alcohol withdrawal: the revised clinical institute withdrawal assessment for alcohol scale (CIWA-Ar). | journal = Br J Addict. | volume = 84 | issue = 11 | pages = 1353–7 | date = Nov 1989 | pmid = 2597811 | pmc =| doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.1989.tb00737.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
A complex mixture of genetic and environmental factors influences the risk of the development of alcoholism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enoch-2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Enoch MA | title = Genetic and environmental influences on the development of alcoholism: resilience vs. risk | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1094 | pages = 193–201 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17347351 | doi = 10.1196/annals.1376.019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by a family history of alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bierut LJ, Schuckit MA, Hesselbrock V, Reich T | title = Co-occurring risk factors for alcohol dependence and habitual smoking | journal = Alcohol Res Health | volume = 24 | issue = 4 | pages = 233–41 | year = 2000 | pmid = 15986718 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the [[gene expression|expression of genes]] which increase the risk of alcohol dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Agrawal A, Sartor CE, Lynskey MT, Grant JD, Pergadia ML, Grucza R, Bucholz KK, Nelson EC, Madden PA, Martin NG, Heath AC | title = Evidence for an Interaction Between Age at 1st Drink and Genetic Influences on DSM-IV Alcohol Dependence Symptoms | journal = Alcoholism: Clinical and Experimental Research | volume = 33 | issue = 12 | pages = 2047–56 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19764935 | pmc = 2883563 | doi = 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2009.01044.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism are also more likely to begin drinking at an earlier age than average.&lt;ref name=&quot;eattrfad&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/164576.php |title=Early Age At First Drink May Modify Tween/Teen Risk For Alcohol Dependence |date=21 September 2009 |publisher=Medical News Today }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism,&lt;ref name=&quot;eattrfad&quot;/&gt; and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schwandt-2010&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schwandt ML, Lindell SG, Chen S, Higley JD, Suomi SJ, Heilig M, Barr CS | title = Alcohol Response and Consumption in Adolescent Rhesus Macaques: Life History and Genetic Influences | journal = Alcohol | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 67–80 | date = February 2010 | pmid = 20113875 | pmc = 2818103 | doi = 10.1016/j.alcohol.2009.09.034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychological trauma|Severe childhood trauma]] is also associated with a general increase in the risk of drug dependency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enoch-2006&quot;/&gt; Lack of peer and family support is associated with an increased risk of alcoholism developing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enoch-2006&quot;/&gt; Genetics and adolescence are associated with an increased sensitivity to the neurotoxic effects of chronic alcohol abuse. [[Cerebral cortex|Cortical]] degeneration due to the neurotoxic effects increases impulsive behaviour, which may contribute to the development, persistence and severity of alcohol use disorders. There is evidence that with abstinence, there is a reversal of at least some of the alcohol induced central nervous system damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crews-2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Crews FT, Boettiger CA | title = Impulsivity, Frontal Lobes and Risk for Addiction | journal = Pharmacol Biochem Behav | volume = 93 | issue = 3 | pages = 237–47 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19410598 | pmc = 2730661 | doi = 10.1016/j.pbb.2009.04.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender difference===
Based on combined data from SAMHSA's 2004–2005 National Surveys on Drug Use &amp; Health, the rate of past year alcohol dependence or abuse among persons aged 12 or older varied by level of alcohol use: 44.7% of past month heavy drinkers, 18.5% binge drinkers, 3.8% past month non-binge drinkers, and 1.3% of those who did not drink alcohol in the past month met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year. Males had higher rates than females for all measures of drinking in the past month: any alcohol use (57.5% vs. 45%), binge drinking (30.8% vs. 15.1%), and heavy alcohol use (10.5% vs. 3.3%), and males were twice as likely as females to have met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year (10.5% vs. 5.1%).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Gender differences in alcohol use and alcohol dependence or abuse: 2004 or 2005.&quot; The NSDUH Report.Accessed 22 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic variation===
{{See also|Human genetic variation}}

Genetic differences exist between different racial groups which affect the risk of developing alcohol dependence. For example, there are differences between African, East Asian and Indo-racial groups in how they metabolize alcohol. These genetic factors are believed to, in part, explain the differing rates of alcohol dependence among racial groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore-2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moore S, Montane-Jaime LK, Carr LG, Ehlers CL | title = Variations in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes in people of East Indian and African descent from Trinidad and Tobago | journal = Alcohol Res Health | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–30 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17718398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eng-2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eng MY, Luczak SE, Wall TL | title = ALDH2, ADH1B, and ADH1C genotypes in Asians: a literature review | journal = Alcohol Res Health | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–7 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17718397 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] allele ADH1 B*3 causes a more rapid metabolism of alcohol.

==Pathophysiology==
{{main|ΔFosB}}

Alcohol's primary effect is the allosteric inhibition of [[NMDA receptor]]s and facilitation of [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]]s (e.g., enhanced GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated [[chloride]] flux through [[allosteric regulation]] of the receptor).&lt;ref name=&quot;NHM-Ethanol&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE | editor = Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 9780071481274 | page = 372 | edition = 2nd | chapter = Chapter 15: Reinforcement and Addictive Disorders | quote= Despite the high concentrations required for its psychoactive effects, ethanol exerts specific actions on the brain. The initial effects of ethanol result primarily from facilitation of GABAA receptors and inhibition of NMDA glutamate receptors. At higher doses, ethanol also inhibits the functioning of most ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels. It is not known whether ethanol selectively affects these channels via direct low affinity binding or via nonspecific disruption of plasma membranes which then selectively influences these highly complex, multimeric, transmembrane proteins. Ethanol allosterically regulates the GABAA receptor to enhance GABA-activated Cl− flux. The anxiolytic and sedative effects of ethanol, as well as those of barbiturates and benzodiazepines, result from enhancement of GABAergic function. Facilitation of GABAA receptor function is also believed to contribute to the reinforcing effects of these drugs. Not all GABAA receptors are ethanol sensitive.&amp;nbsp;... Ethanol also acts as an NMDA antagonist by allosterically inhibiting the passage of glutamate-activated Na+ and Ca2+ currents through the NMDA receptor.&amp;nbsp;... The reinforcing effects of ethanol are partly explained by its ability to activate mesolimbic dopamine circuitry, although it is not known whether this effect is mediated at the level of the VTA or NAc. It also is not known whether this activation of dopamine systems is caused primarily by facilitation of GABAA receptors or inhibition of NMDA receptors, or both. Ethanol reinforcement also is mediated in part by ethanol-induced release of endogenous opioid peptides within the mesolimbic dopamine system, although whether the VTA or NAc is the predominant site of such action is not yet known. Accordingly, the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone reduces ethanol self-administration in animals and is used with modest effect to treat alcoholism in humans. }}&lt;/ref&gt; At high doses, ethanol inhibits most [[ligand gated ion channel]]s and [[voltage gated ion channel]]s in neurons as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHM-Ethanol&quot; /&gt; With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors are desensitized and reduced in number, resulting in [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] and [[physical dependence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Medical toxicology&quot;/&gt; The amount of alcohol that can be biologically processed and its effects differ between sexes. Equal dosages of alcohol consumed by men and women generally result in women having higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), since women generally have a higher percentage of body fat and therefore a lower volume of distribution for alcohol than men, and because the stomachs of men tend to metabolize alcohol more quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Cederbaum AL

===Definition===
Misuse, problem use, abuse, and heavy use refer to improper use of alcohol which may cause physical, social, or moral harm to the drinker.&lt;ref name=&quot;the_american_heritage_dictionary_of_the_english_language_a12&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = American Heritage Dictionaries | title = The American Heritage dictionary of the English language | url = http://books.google.com/?id=uPCFIQAACAAJ | date = 12 April 2006 |publisher = Houghton Mifflin | location = Boston | edition = 4 |quote = To use wrongly or improperly; misuse: abuse alcohol | isbn = 978-0-618-70172-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moderate use is defined by ''The Dietary Guidelines for Americans'' as no more than two alcoholic beverages a day for men and no more than one alcoholic beverage a day for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.health.gov/DIETARYGUIDELINES/dga2005/document/html/chapter9.htm |title=Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 |year=2005|publisher=health.gov |location=USA }} Dietary Guidelines&lt;/ref&gt; Some drinkers may drink more than 600 ml of alcohol per day during a heavy drinking period.&lt;ref&gt;See question 16 of the [[Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]] (NIAAA) defines [[binge drinking]] as the amount of alcohol leading to a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.08, which, for most adults, would be reached by consuming five drinks for men or four for women over a 2-hour period.  According to the NIAAA, men may be at risk for alcohol-related problems if their alcohol consumption exceeds 14 [[standard drink]]s per week or 4 drinks per day, and women may be at risk if they have more than 7 standard drinks per week or 3 drinks per day. It defines a standard drink as one 12-ounce bottle of beer, one 5-ounce glass of wine, or 1.5 ounces of distilled spirits.&lt;ref&gt;http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa68/aa68.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this risk, a 2014 report in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that only 10% of either &quot;heavy drinkers&quot; or &quot;binge drinkers&quot; defined according to the above critera also met the criteria for alcohol dependence, while only 1.3% of non-binge drinkers met this criteria.  An inference drawn from this study is that evidence-based policy strategies and clinical preventive services may effectively reduce binge drinking without requiring addiction treatment in most cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Esser2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Esser|first1=Marissa B.|last2=Hedden|first2=Sarra L.|last3=Kanny|first3=Dafna|last4=Brewer|first4=Robert D.|last5=Gfroerer|first5=Joseph C.|last6=Naimi|first6=Timothy S.|title=Prevalence of Alcohol Dependence Among US Adult Drinkers, 2009–2011|journal=Preventing Chronic Disease|date=20 November 2014|volume=11|doi=10.5888/pcd11.140329}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The term &quot;alcoholism&quot; is commonly used, but poorly defined. The WHO calls alcoholism &quot;a term of long-standing use and variable meaning&quot;, and use of the term was disfavored by a 1979 WHO Expert Committee. ''[[The Big Book (Alcoholics Anonymous)|The Big Book]]'' (from [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]) states that once a person is an alcoholic, they are always an alcoholic, but does not define what is meant by the term &quot;alcoholic&quot; in this context. In 1960, [[Bill W.]], co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), said:

:We have never called alcoholism a [[disease]] because, technically speaking, it is not a disease entity. For example, there is no such thing as [[heart disease]]. Instead there are many separate heart ailments, or combinations of them. It is something like that with alcoholism. Therefore we did not wish to get in wrong with the medical profession by pronouncing alcoholism a disease entity. Therefore we always called it an [[illness]], or a [[malady]]—a far safer term for us to use.&lt;ref name=&quot;McGovernWhite2003&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Thomas F. McGovern|author2=William L. White|title=Alcohol Problems in the United States: Twenty Years of Treatment Perspective|url=http://books.google.com/?id=3gRwmYohuooC&amp;pg=PA7|accessdate=17 April 2010|date=20 May 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7890-2049-9|pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In professional and research contexts, the term &quot;alcoholism&quot; sometimes encompasses both alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence,&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|one/000002709|alcoholism}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes is considered equivalent to alcohol dependence.
Talbot (1989) observes that alcoholism in the classical disease model follows a progressive course: if a person continues to drink, their condition will worsen. This will lead to harmful consequences in their life, physically, mentally, emotionally and socially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thombs|first=Dennis L|title=Introductive To Addictive Behaviors 2ed|year=1999|publisher=The Guildford Press|location=London|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson (1980) explores the emotional progression of the addict’s response to alcohol. He looks at this in four phases. The first two are considered “normal” drinking and the last two are viewed as &quot;typical&quot; alcoholic drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thombs|first=Dennis L|title=Introduction to Addictive Behaviours 2ed|year=1999|publisher=The Guildford Press|location=London|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thombs|first=Dennis|title=Introduction to Addictive Behaviors|year=1999|publisher=The Guildford Press|location=London|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson's four phases consist of:

# Learning the mood swing. A person is introduced to alcohol (in some cultures this can happen at a relatively young age), and the person enjoys the happy feeling it produces.  At this stage there is no emotional cost.
# Seeking the mood swing. A person will drink to regain that feeling of euphoria experienced in phase 1; the drinking will increase as more intoxication is required to achieve the same effect. Again at this stage, there are no significant consequences.
# At the third stage there are physical and social consequences, i.e., hangovers, family problems, work problems, etc. A person will continue to drink excessively, disregarding the problems.
# The fourth stage can be detrimental, as Johnson cites it as a risk for premature death. As a person now drinks to feel normal, they block out the feelings of overwhelming guilt, remorse, anxiety, and shame they experience when sober.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thombs|first=Dennis L|title=Introduction to Addictive Behaviors 2ed|year=1999|publisher=The Guildford Press|location=London|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theorists such as Milam &amp; Ketcham (1983) focus on the physical deterioration of alcohol. They describe the process in three stages:

# Adaptive stage – The person will not experience any negative symptoms, and believe they have capacity for alcohol. Physiological changes are happening with the increase in tolerance, but this will not be noticeable to the drinker or others.
# Dependent stage – At this stage, symptoms build gradually. Hangover symptoms may be confused with withdrawal symptoms. Many addicts will maintain their drinking to avoid withdrawal sickness, drinking small amounts frequently. They will try to hide their problem from others, and will avoid gross intoxication.
# Deterioration stage – Various organs are damaged due to long-term drinking. Medical treatment will be required; otherwise the pathological changes will cause death.

In psychology and psychiatry, the DSM is the most common global standard, while in medicine, the standard is ICD. The terms they recommend are similar but not identical.

The [[DSM-IV]] diagnosis of alcohol dependence represents one approach to the definition of alcoholism. In part this is to assist in the development of research protocols in which findings can be compared to one another. According to the DSM-IV, an alcohol dependence diagnosis is: &quot;maladaptive alcohol use with clinically significant impairment as manifested by at least three of the following within any one-year period: tolerance; withdrawal; taken in greater amounts or over longer time course than intended; desire or unsuccessful attempts to cut down or control use; great deal of time spent obtaining, using, or recovering from use; social, occupational, or recreational activities given up or reduced; continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological [[sequela]]e.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DSMIV&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| title = Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV | url = http://books.google.com/?id=W-BGAAAAMAAJ | date = 31 July 1994 | publisher = American Psychiatric Association | location = Washington, DC | isbn = 978-0-89042-025-6 | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the imprecision inherent in the term, there have been attempts to define how the word &quot;alcoholism&quot; should be interpreted when encountered. In 1992, it was defined by the [[National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence|NCADD]] and [[American Society of Addiction Medicine|ASAM]] as &quot;a primary, chronic disease characterized by impaired control over drinking, preoccupation with the drug alcohol, use of alcohol despite adverse consequences, and distortions in thinking.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Morse RM, Flavin DK | title = The definition of alcoholism.

Silkworth M.D.]] writes on behalf of AA that &quot;Alcoholics suffer from a &quot;(physical) craving beyond mental control&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AABigBook&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|XXVI}}

A 1960 study by [[E. Morton Jellinek]] is considered the foundation of the modern [[disease theory of alcoholism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=OCTOBER 22 DEATHS|url=http://www.todayinsci.com/10/10_22.htm|publisher=todayinsci.com|accessdate=18 February 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080207170157/http://www.todayinsci.com/10/10_22.htm| archivedate= 7 February 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jellinek's definition restricted the use of the word &quot;alcoholism&quot; to those showing a particular [[natural history of disease|natural history]]. The modern medical definition of alcoholism has been revised numerous times since then. The [[American Medical Association]] currently uses the word alcoholism to refer to a particular chronic primary disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/388/sci_drug_addiction.pdf |title=Science of Addiction |author=Nora Volkow|publisher=American Medical Association |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social barriers===
Attitudes and social stereotypes can create barriers to the detection and treatment of alcohol abuse. This is more of a barrier for women than men. Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are suffering from a medical condition, to hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be less likely to suspect that a woman they know is an alcoholic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blume Laura N., Nielson Nancy H., Riggs Joseph A., et all 1998 861–870&quot; &gt;{{Cite journal|author=Blume Laura N., Nielson Nancy H., Riggs Joseph A., ''et all'' |title=Alcoholism and alcohol abuse among women: report of the council on scientific affairs |journal=Journal of women's health |volume=7 |issue=7 |pages=861–870 |year=1998 |doi= 10.1089/jwh.1998.7.861|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men to admit that they are suffering from a medical condition, to display their drinking publicly, and to drink in groups. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be more likely to suspect that a man they know is an alcoholic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karrol Brad R. 2002 337–356&quot; /&gt;

===Screening===
Several tools may be used to detect a loss of control of alcohol use. These tools are mostly [[self report study|self-report]]s in questionnaire form. Another common theme is a score or tally that sums up the general severity of alcohol use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kahan-1996&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kahan M | title = Identifying and managing problem drinkers | journal = Can Fam Physician | volume = 42 | issue =  | pages = 661–71 | date = April 1996 | pmid = 8653034 | pmc = 2146411 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[CAGE questionnaire]], named for its four questions, is one such example that may be used to screen patients quickly in a doctor's office.

{{Quotation|Two &quot;yes&quot; responses indicate that the respondent should be investigated further.

The questionnaire asks the following questions:

# Have you ever felt you needed to '''C'''ut down on your drinking?
# Have people '''A'''nnoyed you by criticizing your drinking?
# Have you ever felt '''G'''uilty about drinking?
# Have you ever felt you needed a drink first thing in the morning ('''E'''ye-opener) to steady your nerves or to get rid of a hangover?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ewing JA |title=Detecting alcoholism. The CAGE questionnaire |journal=JAMA: the Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=252 |issue=14 |pages=1905–7 |date=October 1984 |pmid=6471323 |doi=10.1001/jama.252.14.1905 |url= |issn=0098-7484 |type= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whoguidemhpcuk.org/downloads/primary_care/11-1_CAGE_questionnaire.pdf |title=CAGE questionnaire – screen for alcohol misuse |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

:The CAGE questionnaire has demonstrated a high effectiveness in detecting alcohol-related problems; however, it has limitations in people with less severe alcohol-related problems, white women and college students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dhalla S, Kopec JA | title = The CAGE questionnaire for alcohol misuse: a review of reliability and validity studies | journal = Clin Invest Med | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–41 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17716538 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other tests are sometimes used for the detection of alcohol dependence, such as the [[Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire]], which is a more sensitive diagnostic test than the [[CAGE questionnaire]]. It helps distinguish a diagnosis of alcohol dependence from one of heavy alcohol use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/html.cfm/index3556EN.html |title=Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire (SADD) |author=Raistrick, D. |coauthors=Dunbar, G.

The [[Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test]] (AUDIT), a screening questionnaire developed by the [[World Health Organization]], is unique in that it has been validated in six countries and is used internationally. Like the [[CAGE questionnaire]], it uses a simple set of questions – a high score earning a deeper investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2001/WHO_MSD_MSB_01.6a.pdf |title=The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, Guidelines for Use in Primary Care |author=Thomas F.

It concords well with the AUDIT questionnaire but is administered in a fifth of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Smith SG, Touquet R, Wright S, Das Gupta N | title = Detection of alcohol misusing patients in accident and emergency departments: the Paddington alcohol test (PAT) | journal = Journal of Accident and Emergency Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 5 | pages = 308–312 | date = September 1996 | pmid = 8894853 | pmc = 1342761 | doi = 10.1136/emj.13.5.308 | publisher = British Association for Accident and Emergency Medicine | issn = 1351-0622 | last2 = Touquet | first2 = R | last3 = Wright | first3 = S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic predisposition testing===
Psychiatric geneticists John I. Nurnberger, Jr., and Laura Jean Bierut suggest that alcoholism does not have a single cause—including genetic—but that genes do play an important role &quot;by affecting processes in the body and brain that [[Gene-environment interaction|interact with]] one another and with an individual's life experiences to produce protection or susceptibility&quot;. They also report that fewer than a dozen alcoholism-related genes have been identified, but that more likely await discovery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nurnberger&quot;&gt;Nurnberger, Jr., John I., and Bierut, Laura Jean. [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&amp;colID=1&amp;articleID=5C303E5F-E7F2-99DF-315ADC8A107AE976 &quot;Seeking the Connections: Alcoholism and our Genes.&quot;] ''[[Scientific American]]'', April 2007, Vol. 296, Issue 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one genetic test exists for an [[allele]] that is correlated to alcoholism and opiate addiction.&lt;ref&gt;New York Daily News (William Sherman) [http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2006/02/12/2006-02-12_test_targets_addiction_gene.html Test targets addiction gene] 11 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Human dopamine receptor genes have a detectable variation referred to as the DRD2 TaqI polymorphism. Those who possess the A1 allele (variation) of this polymorphism have a small but significant tendency towards addiction to opiates and endorphin-releasing drugs like alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Berggren U, Fahlke C, Aronsson E, Karanti A, Eriksson M, Blennow K, Thelle D, Zetterberg H, Balldin J | title = The taqI DRD2 A1 allele is associated with alcohol-dependence although its effect size is small | journal = Alcohol and alcoholism (Oxford, Oxfordshire) | volume = 41 | issue = 5 | pages = 479–85 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16751215 | doi = 10.1093/alcalc/agl043 | url = http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/41/5/479 | issn = 0735-0414 | format = Free full text }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this allele is slightly more common in alcoholics and opiate addicts, it is not by itself an adequate predictor of alcoholism, and some researchers argue that evidence for DRD2 is contradictory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nurnberger&quot; /&gt;

===Urine and blood tests===
There are reliable tests for the actual use of alcohol, one common test being that of [[blood alcohol content]] (BAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jones AW | title = Urine as a biological specimen for forensic analysis of alcohol and variability in the urine-to-blood relationship | journal = Toxicol Rev | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–35 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16856767 | doi = 10.2165/00139709-200625010-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These tests do not differentiate alcoholics from non-alcoholics; however, long-term heavy drinking does have a few recognizable effects on the body, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Das SK, Dhanya L, Vasudevan DM | title = Biomarkers of alcoholism: an updated review | journal = Scand J Clin Lab Invest | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | pages = 81–92 | year = 2008 | pmid = 17852805 | doi = 10.1080/00365510701532662 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Macrocytosis]] (enlarged [[Mean corpuscular volume|MCV]])
* Elevated [[Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase|GGT]]
* Moderate elevation of [[Aspartate transaminase|AST]] and [[Alanine transaminase|ALT]] and an AST: ALT ratio of 2:1
* High [[carbohydrate deficient transferrin]] (CDT)

However, none of these blood tests for biological markers is as sensitive as screening questionnaires.

==Prevention==
The [[World Health Organization]], the [[European Union]] and other regional bodies, national governments and parliaments have formed alcohol policies in order to reduce the harm of alcoholism.&lt;ref name=&quot;alchwho2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/topics/alcohol_drinking/en/ |title=Alcohol |author=World Health Organisation |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;apitwhoer&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/mediacentre/fs1005e.pdf |title=Alcohol policy in the WHO European Region: current status and the way forward |date=12 September 2005 |publisher=World Health Organisation |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Targeting adolescents and young adults is regarded as an important step to reduce the harm of alcohol abuse. Increasing the age at which licit drugs of abuse such as alcohol can be purchased, the banning or restricting advertising of alcohol has been recommended as additional ways of reducing the harm of alcohol dependence and abuse. Credible, [[evidence based]] educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of alcohol abuse have been recommended. Guidelines for parents to prevent alcohol abuse amongst adolescents, and for helping young people with mental health problems have also been suggested.&lt;ref name=&quot;acdacpovfa&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Crews F, He J, Hodge C | title = Adolescent cortical development: a critical period of vulnerability for addiction | journal = Pharmacol Biochem Behav | volume = 86 | issue = 2 | pages = 189–99 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17222895 | doi = 10.1016/j.pbb.2006.12.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Treatments are varied because there are multiple perspectives of alcoholism. Those who approach alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments from, for instance, those who approach the condition as one of social choice. Most treatments focus on helping people discontinue their alcohol intake, followed up with life training and/or social support to help them resist a return to alcohol use. Since alcoholism involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking, they must all be addressed to successfully prevent a relapse. An example of this kind of treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms. The treatment community for alcoholism typically supports an abstinence-based [[zero tolerance]] approach; however, some prefer a harm-reduction approach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gabbard&quot;/&gt;

===Detoxification===
{{Main|Alcohol detoxification}}
[[Alcohol detoxification]] or 'detox' for alcoholics is an abrupt stop of alcohol drinking coupled with the substitution of drugs, such as [[benzodiazepines]], that have similar effects to prevent [[Alcohol withdrawal syndrome|alcohol withdrawal]]. Individuals who are only at risk of mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms can be detoxified as outpatients. Individuals at risk of a severe withdrawal syndrome as well as those who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients. Detoxification does not actually treat alcoholism, and it is necessary to follow-up detoxification with an appropriate treatment program for alcohol dependence or abuse to reduce the risk of relapse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blondell-2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Blondell RD | title = Ambulatory detoxification of patients with alcohol dependence | journal = Am Fam Physician | volume = 71 | issue = 3 | pages = 495–502 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15712624 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as depressed mood and anxiety typically take weeks or months to abate while other symptoms persist longer due to persisting neuroadaptations.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20148778&quot; /&gt; Alcoholism has serious adverse effects on brain function; on average it takes one year of abstinence to recover from the cognitive deficits incurred by chronic alcohol abuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stavro-2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Stavro K, Pelletier J, Potvin S | title = Widespread and sustained cognitive deficits in alcoholism: a meta-analysis. | journal = Addict Biol | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 203–13 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22264351 | doi = 10.1111/j.1369-1600.2011.00418.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological===
[[Image:Alcoholics Anonymous Regional Service Center by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|A regional service center for [[Alcoholics Anonymous]].]]

Various forms of [[group therapy]] or [[psychotherapy]] can be used to deal with underlying psychological issues that are related to alcohol addiction, as well as provide relapse prevention skills. The mutual-help group-counseling approach is one of the most common ways of helping alcoholics maintain sobriety.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morgan-Lopez-2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Morgan-Lopez AA, Fals-Stewart W | title = Analytic complexities associated with group therapy in substance abuse treatment research: problems, recommendations, and future directions | journal = Exp Clin Psychopharmacol | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 265–73 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16756430 | doi = 10.1037/1064-1297.14.2.265 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Soyka-2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Soyka M, Helten C, Scharfenberg CO | title = [Psychotherapy of alcohol addiction—principles and new findings of therapy research] | journal = Wien Med Wochenschr | volume = 151 | issue = 15–17 | pages = 380–8; discussion 389 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11603209 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] was one of the first organizations formed to provide mutual, nonprofessional counseling, and it is still the largest.

Rationing and moderation programs such as [[Moderation Management]] and DrinkWise do not mandate complete abstinence. While most alcoholics are unable to limit their drinking in this way, some return to moderate drinking. A 2002 US study by the [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]] (NIAAA) showed that 17.7 percent of individuals diagnosed as alcohol dependent more than one year prior returned to low-risk drinking. This group, however, showed fewer initial symptoms of dependency.&lt;ref name=&quot;DAWSON2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dawson DA, Grant BF, Stinson FS, Chou PS, Huang B, Ruan WJ | title = Recovery from DSM-IV alcohol dependence: United States, 2001–2002 | journal = Addiction | volume = 100 | issue = 3 | pages = 281–92 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15733237 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2004.00964.x | url = http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh29-2/131-142.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up study, using the same subjects that were judged to be in remission in 2001–2002, examined the rates of return to problem drinking in 2004–2005.

===Medications===
In the United States there are four currently approved medications for alcoholism: [[disulfiram]], two forms of [[naltrexone]], and [[acamprosate]].&lt;ref&gt;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.  http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/AA76/AA76.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Several other drugs are also used and many are under investigation.

*[[Acamprosate]] (Campral) may stabilise the brain chemistry that is altered due to alcohol dependence via antagonising the actions of [[glutamate]], a neurotransmitter which is hyperactive in the [[post-withdrawal]] phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mason BJ, Heyser CJ | title = The neurobiology, clinical efficacy and safety of acamprosate in the treatment of alcohol dependence | journal = Expert Opin Drug Saf | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 177–88 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20021295 | doi = 10.1517/14740330903512943 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By reducing excessive NMDA activity which occurs at the onset of alcohol withdrawal, acamprosate can reduce or prevent alcohol withdrawal related neurotoxicity.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid20201812&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mason BJ, Heyser CJ | title = Acamprosate: A prototypic neuromodulator in the treatment of alcohol dependence | journal = CNS Neurol Disord Drug Targets | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 23–32 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20201812 | pmc = 2853976 | doi = 10.2174/187152710790966641 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acamprosate reduces the risk of relapse amongst alcohol dependent persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rösner S, Hackl-Herrwerth A, Leucht S, Lehert P, Vecchi S, Soyka M | title = Acamprosate for alcohol dependence | journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 9 | pages = CD004332 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20824837 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004332.pub2 | editor1-last = Rösner | editor1-first = Susanne }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JAMA2014&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jonas DE, Amick HR, Feltner C, Bobashev G, Thomas K, Wines R, Kim MM, Shanahan E, Gass CE, Rowe CJ, Garbutt JC | title = Pharmacotherapy for Adults With Alcohol Use Disorders in Outpatient Settings | journal = JAMA | volume = 311 | issue = 18 | pages = 1889–900 | date = 14 May 2014 | pmid = 24825644 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2014.3628 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Benzodiazepines]], while useful in the management of acute alcohol withdrawal, if used long-term can cause a worse outcome in alcoholism. Alcoholics on chronic benzodiazepines have a lower rate of achieving abstinence from alcohol than those not taking benzodiazepines. This class of drugs is commonly prescribed to alcoholics for insomnia or anxiety management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor1-first=S.J.E. |editor1-last=Lindsay |editor2-first=Graham E. |editor2-last=Powell |title=The Handbook of Clinical Adult Psychology |url=http://books.google.com/?id=a6A9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA380 |edition=2nd |date=28 July 1998 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-07215-1 |page=402 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initiating prescriptions of benzodiazepines or sedative-hypnotics in individuals in recovery has a high rate of relapse with one author reporting more than a quarter of people relapsed after being prescribed sedative-hypnotics. Those who are long-term users of benzodiazepines should not be withdrawn rapidly, as severe anxiety and panic may develop, which are known risk factors for relapse into alcohol abuse. Taper regimes of 6–12 months have been found to be the most successful, with reduced intensity of withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Gitlow |first1=Stuart |title=Substance Use Disorders: A Practical Guide |url=http://books.google.com/?id=rbrSdWVerBUC |edition=2nd |date=1 October 2006 |publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins |location=USA |isbn=978-0-7817-6998-3 |pages=52 and 103–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kushner MG, Abrams K, Borchardt C | title = The relationship between anxiety disorders and alcohol use disorders: a review of major perspectives and findings | journal = Clin Psychol Rev | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 149–71 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10721495 | doi = 10.1016/S0272-7358(99)00027-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Calcium carbimide]] (Temposil) works in the same way as disulfiram; it has an advantage in that the occasional adverse effects of disulfiram, [[hepatotoxicity]] and drowsiness, do not occur with calcium carbimide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ogborne AC | title = Identifying and treating patients with alcohol-related problems | journal = CMAJ | volume = 162 | issue = 12 | pages = 1705–8 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10870503 | pmc = 1232509 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Disulfiram]] (Antabuse) prevents the elimination of [[acetaldehyde]], a chemical the body produces when breaking down ethanol. Acetaldehyde itself is the cause of many [[hangover]] symptoms from alcohol use. The overall effect is severe discomfort when alcohol is ingested: an extremely fast-acting and long-lasting uncomfortable hangover. This discourages an alcoholic from drinking in significant amounts while they take the medicine.

*[[Naltrexone]] is a [[competitive antagonist]] for opioid receptors, effectively blocking the effects of [[endorphin]]s and [[opiate]]s. Naltrexone is used to decrease cravings for alcohol and encourage abstinence. Alcohol causes the body to release endorphins, which in turn release dopamine and activate the reward pathways; hence when naltrexone is in the body there is a reduction in the pleasurable effects from consuming alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Soyka M, Rösner S | title = Opioid antagonists for pharmacological treatment of alcohol dependence – a critical review | journal = Curr Drug Abuse Rev | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 280–91 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 19630726 | doi = 10.2174/1874473710801030280 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence supports a reduced risk of relapse among alcohol dependent persons and a decrease in excessive drinking.&lt;ref name=JAMA2014/&gt; [[Nalmefene]] also appears effective and works by a similar manner.&lt;ref name=JAMA2014/&gt;

Evidence does not support the use of [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRIs), [[tricyclic antidepressants]] (TCAs), [[antipsychotic]]s, or [[gabapentin]].&lt;ref name=JAMA2014/&gt;

===Dual addictions===
Alcoholics may also require treatment for other psychotropic drug addictions. The most common dual addiction in alcohol dependence is [[benzodiazepine dependence]], with studies showing 10–20 percent of alcohol-dependent individuals had problems of dependence and/or misuse problems of benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines increase cravings for alcohol and the volume of alcohol consumed by problem drinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Poulos CX, Zack M | title = Low-dose diazepam primes motivation for alcohol and alcohol-related semantic networks in problem drinkers | journal = Behav Pharmacol | volume = 15 | issue = 7 | pages = 503–12 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15472572 | doi = 10.1097/00008877-200411000-00006 | url =  | issn = 0955-8810 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Benzodiazepine dependency requires careful reduction in dosage to avoid [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] and other health consequences.

Dependence on other sedative hypnotics such as [[zolpidem]] and [[zopiclone]] as well as [[opiate]]s and illegal drugs is common in alcoholics.

Alcohol itself is a sedative-hypnotic and is cross-tolerant with other sedative-hypnotics  such as [[barbiturate]]s, benzodiazepines and [[nonbenzodiazepine]]s. Dependence upon and withdrawal from sedative hypnotics can be medically severe and, as with alcohol withdrawal, there is a risk of [[psychosis]] or [[seizure]]s if not managed properly.&lt;ref name=&quot;dolpdaa&quot;/&gt;

Substance use disorders are a major [[public health]] problem facing many countries. &quot;The most common substance of abuse/dependence in patients presenting for treatment is alcohol.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gabbard&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Gabbard | first1 = Glen O. | title = Treatments of psychiatric disorders | year = 2001 | publisher = American Psychiatric Press | location = Washington, DC | url = http://books.google.com/?id=hLVrAAAAMAAJ |edition=3| isbn = 978-0-88048-910-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]], the number of 'dependent drinkers' was calculated as over 2.8 million in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;cosu&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sia.dfc.unifi.it/costi%20uk.pdf |title=Alcohol misuse: How much does it cost? |author= |authorlink= |date = September 2003|publisher=Cabinet Office Strategy Unit |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 12% of American adults have had an alcohol dependence problem at some time in their life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hasin DS, Stinson FS, Ogburn E, Grant BF | title = Prevalence, Correlates, Disability, and Comorbidity of DSM-IV Alcohol Abuse and Dependence in the United States | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 64 | issue = 7 | pages = 830–42 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17606817 | doi = 10.1001/archpsyc.64.7.830 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] estimates that about 140 million people throughout the world suffer from alcohol dependence.&lt;ref name=&quot;whoemcoypaa&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/director-general/speeches/2001/english/20010219_youngpeoplealcohol.en.html |title=WHO European Ministerial Conference on Young People and Alcohol |author=Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland |authorlink=Gro Harlem Brundtland |date=19 February 2001 |publisher=[[World Health Organisation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;whotmbcrtdhrai&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr6/en/index.html |title=WHO to meet beverage company representatives to discuss health-related alcohol issues |author=Ms Leanne Riley |date=31 January 2003 |publisher=[[World Health Organisation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States and Western Europe, 10 to 20 percent of men and 5 to 10 percent of women at some point in their lives will meet criteria for alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/13448/alcoholism |title=alcoholism |year=2010 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the medical and scientific communities, there is broad consensus regarding alcoholism as a disease state. For example, the American Medical Association considers alcohol a drug and states that &quot;drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing brain disease characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use despite often devastating consequences. It results from a complex interplay of biological vulnerability, environmental exposure, and developmental factors (e.g., stage of brain maturity).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

Alcoholism has a higher prevalence among men, though in recent decades, the proportion of female alcoholics has increased.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walter H., Gutierrez K., Ramskogler K., Hertling I., Dvorak A., Lesch O.M., et al. 2003 253–268&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Walter H, Gutierrez K, Ramskogler K, Hertling I, Dvorak A, Lesch OM | title = Gender-specific differences in alcoholism: implications for treatment | journal = Archives of Women's Mental Health | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 253–8 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14628177 | doi = 10.1007/s00737-003-0014-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Current evidence indicates that in both men and women, alcoholism is 50–60 percent genetically determined, leaving 40–50 percent for environmental influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dick DM, Bierut LJ | title = The genetics of alcohol dependence | journal = Current psychiatry reports | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 151–7 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16539893 | doi = 10.1007/s11920-006-0015-1 | url =  | issn = 1523-3812 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most alcoholics develop alcoholism during adolescence or young adulthood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enoch-2006&quot;/&gt; 31 percent of college students show signs of alcohol abuse, while six percent are dependent on alcohol. Under the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]]'s new definition of alcoholics, that means about 37 percent of college students may meet the criteria.&lt;ref&gt;http://dailyemerald.com/2012/05/22/redefining-alcoholic-what-this-means-for-students/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prognosis==
A 2002 study by the [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]] surveyed a group of 4,422 adults meeting the criteria for [[alcohol dependence]] and found that after one year, some met the authors' criteria for low-risk drinking, even though only 25.5 percent of the group received any treatment, with the breakdown as follows: 25 percent were found to be still dependent, 27.3 percent were in partial remission (some symptoms persist), 11.8 percent asymptomatic drinkers (consumption increases chances of relapse) and 35.9 percent were fully recovered — made up of 17.7 percent low-risk drinkers plus 18.2 percent abstainers.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIAAA2002&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/jan2005/niaaa-18.htm |title=2001–2002 Survey Finds That Many Recover From Alcoholism |author=The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism |coauthors=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, NIH News |date=18 January 2005 |publisher=National Institutes of Health }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, however, the results of a long-term (60-year) follow-up of two groups of alcoholic men by George Vaillant at Harvard Medical School indicated that &quot;return to controlled drinking rarely persisted for much more than a decade without relapse or evolution into abstinence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vaillant GE | title = A 60-year follow-up of alcoholic men | journal = Addiction. | volume = 98 | issue = 8 | pages = 1043–51 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12873238 | doi = 10.1046/j.1360-0443.2003.00422.x | issn = 0965-2140 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaillant also noted that &quot;return-to-controlled drinking, as reported in short-term studies, is often a mirage.&quot;

The most common cause of death in alcoholics is from cardiovascular complications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zuskin-2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zuskin E, Jukić V, Lipozencić J, Matosić A, Mustajbegović J, Turcić N, Poplasen-Orlovac D, Bubas M, Prohić A | title = [Alcoholism—how it affects health and working capacity] | journal = Arh Hig Rada Toksikol | volume = 57 | issue = 4 | pages = 413–26 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17265681 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a high rate of suicide in chronic alcoholics, which increases the longer a person drinks.

Alcohol has a long history of use and misuse throughout recorded history. Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence on alcohol. In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others its abuse was condemned. Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognised as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness led to the failed [[prohibition]] of alcohol being considered and eventually enforced briefly in America. In 2005 the cost of alcohol dependence and abuse was estimated to cost the US economy approximately 220 billion dollars per year, more than cancer and obesity.&lt;ref name=&quot;soa2008&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Potter |first1= James V. |volume=2 |title=Substances of Abuse |url=http://books.google.com/?id=WU73eJAIDI4C&amp;pg=PA1 |date=14 January 2008 |publisher=AFS Publishing Co |isbn=978-1-930327-46-7 |pages=1–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various health problems associated with long-term alcohol consumption are generally perceived as detrimental to society, for example, money due to lost labor-hours, medical costs, and secondary treatment costs. Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for [[head injury|head injuries]], [[motor vehicle accident]]s, violence, and assaults. Beyond money, there are also significant social costs to both the alcoholic and their family and friends.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jessica Kingsley Publishers&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last1=McCully |first1=Chris |title=Goodbye Mr. Wonderful.

[[Stereotype]]s of alcoholics are often found in [[fiction]] and [[popular culture]]. The &quot;[[town drunk]]&quot; is a [[stock character]] in Western popular culture.

Alcohol consumption is relatively similar between many European cultures, the United States, and Australia. In Asian countries that have a high gross domestic product, there is heightened drinking compared to other Asian countries, but it is nowhere near as high as it is in other countries like the United States. It is also inversely seen, with countries that have very low gross domestic product showing high alcohol consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chen CC, Yin SJ | title = Alcohol abuse and related factors in Asia | journal = International Review of Psychiatry | volume = 20 | issue = 5 | pages = 425–433 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19012127 | doi = 10.1080/09540260802344075 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study done on Korean immigrants in Canada, they reported alcohol was even an integral part of their meal, and is the only time solo drinking should occur.  They also believe alcohol is necessary at any social event as it helps conversations start.&lt;ref&gt;Wooksoo, K. (2009). Drinking Culture of Elderly Korean Immigrants in Canada: A Focus Group Study.

Caucasians have a much lower abstinence rate (11.8%) and much higher tolerance to symptoms (3.4±2.45 drinks) of alcohol than Chinese (33.4% and 2.2±1.78 drinks respectively).  Also, the more acculturation there is between cultures, the more influenced the culture is to adopt Caucasians drinking practices.&lt;ref&gt;Li, H. Z., &amp; Rosenblood, L. (1994).

[[Peyote]], a psychoactive agent, has even shown promise in treating alcoholism.

==Research==
[[Topiramate]], a derivative of the naturally occurring sugar monosaccharide D-fructose, has been found effective in helping alcoholics quit or cut back on the amount they drink. Evidence suggests that topiramate antagonizes excitatory glutamate receptors, inhibits dopamine release, and enhances inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid function. A 2008 review of the effectiveness of topiramate concluded that the results of published trials are promising, however as of 2008, data was insufficient to support using topiramate in conjunction with brief weekly compliance counseling as a first-line agent for alcohol dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Olmsted CL, Kockler DR | title = Topiramate for alcohol dependence | journal = Ann Pharmacother | volume = 42 | issue = 10 | pages = 1475–80 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18698008 | doi = 10.1345/aph.1L157 | issn = 1060-0280 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 review found that topiramate may be superior to existing alcohol pharmacotherapeutic options. Topiramate effectively reduces craving and alcohol withdrawal severity as well as improving quality-of-life-ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kenna GA, Lomastro TL, Schiesl A, Leggio L, Swift RM | title = Review of topiramate: an antiepileptic for the treatment of alcohol dependence | journal = Curr Drug Abuse Rev | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 135–42 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19630744 | doi = 10.2174/1874473710902020135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baclofen]], a [[GABAB receptor]] agonist, is under study for the treatment of alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Leggio L, Garbutt JC, Addolorato G | title = Effectiveness and safety of baclofen in the treatment of alcohol dependent patients. | journal = CNS &amp; neurological disorders drug targets | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–44 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20201813 | doi = 10.2174/187152710790966614 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A systematic review concluded that there is insufficient evidence for the use of baclofen for withdrawal symptoms in alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Liu J, Wang LN | title = Baclofen for alcohol withdrawal. | journal = The Cochrane database of systematic reviews | volume = 2 | pages = CD008502 | date = 28 February 2013 | pmid = 23450582 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD008502.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is tentative data supporting baclofen in alcohol dependence however further trials are needed as of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =  | title = Baclofen and severe alcohol dependence: an uncertain harm-benefit balance as of early 2013. | journal = Prescrire Int | volume = 22 | issue = 141 | pages = 214–7 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 24171218 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ondansetron]], a 5HT3 antagonist, appears promising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kenna GA | title = Medications acting on the serotonergic system for the treatment of alcohol dependent patients. | journal = Current pharmaceutical design | volume = 16 | issue = 19 | pages = 2126–35 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20482508 | doi = 10.2174/138161210791516396 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
