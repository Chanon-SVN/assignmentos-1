'''Alan Mathison Turing''', &lt;small&gt;[[Order of the British Empire|OBE]]&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;small&gt;[[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]&lt;/small&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tj|ʊər|ɪ|ŋ}} {{Respell|TEWR|ing}}; 23 June 1912&amp;nbsp;– 7 June 1954) was a British  pioneering [[computer scientist]], [[mathematician]], [[logic]]ian, [[cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]], philosopher, mathematical biologist, and marathon and ultra distance runner.  He was highly influential in the development of [[computer science]], providing a formalisation of the concepts of &quot;[[algorithm]]&quot; and &quot;[[computation]]&quot; with the [[Turing machine]], which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer.&lt;ref name=&quot;frs&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1098/rsbm.1955.0019|noedit}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sipser|2006|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beavers|2013|p=481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], Turing worked for the [[Government Communications Headquarters#Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)|Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)]] at [[Bletchley Park]], Britain's [[cryptanalysis|codebreaking]] centre. For a time he led [[Hut 8]], the section responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. He devised a number of techniques for breaking German [[cipher]]s, including improvements to the pre-war Polish [[bombe]] method, an [[electromechanics|electromechanical]] machine that could find settings for the [[Enigma machine]]. Turing's pivotal role in cracking intercepted coded messages enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the [[Battle of the Atlantic]]; it has been estimated that the work at Bletchley Park shortened the war in Europe by as many as two to four years.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite news | last=Copeland | first=Jack | authorlink=Jack Copeland | title= Alan Turing: The codebreaker who saved 'millions of lives' | date=18 June 2012 | url=http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-18419691 | publisher=BBC News Technology | accessdate= 26 October 2014}} A number of sources state that Winston Churchill said that Turing made the single biggest contribution to Allied victory in the war against Nazi Germany. However both [[The Churchill Centre]] and Turing's biographer [[Andrew Hodges]] have said they know of no documentary evidence to support this claim nor of the date or context in which Churchill supposedly said it.

After the war, he worked at the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]], where he designed the [[Automatic Computing Engine|ACE]], among the first designs for a stored-program computer. In 1948 Turing joined [[Max Newman]]'s Computing Laboratory at [[Victoria University of Manchester|Manchester University]], where he assisted development of the [[Manchester computers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|pp=231–233}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became interested in [[mathematical biology]]. He wrote a paper on the chemical basis of [[morphogenesis]], and predicted [[Chemical clock|oscillating]] [[chemical reaction]]s such as the [[Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction]], first observed in the 1960s.

Turing was prosecuted in 1952 for [[homosexuality|homosexual acts]], when such behaviour was still [[Labouchere Amendment|criminalised in the UK]]. He accepted treatment with [[estrogen|oestrogen]] injections ([[chemical castration]]) as an alternative to prison. Turing died in 1954, 16 days before his 42nd birthday, from [[cyanide]] poisoning. An inquest determined his death a suicide; his mother and some others believed it was accidental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pease |first=Roland |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18561092 |publisher=BBC News  |date=26 June 2012 |accessdate=25 December 2013|title=Alan Turing: Inquest's suicide verdict 'not supportable'}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, following an [[Internet activism|Internet campaign]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] made an [[#Government apology and pardon support|official public apology]] on behalf of the British government for &quot;the appalling way he was treated&quot;. [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] granted him a posthumous [[pardon]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=BBC-pardon24Dec/&gt;&lt;ref name=turingpardoncryptome24dec2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/2013/12/turing-pardon.pdf|title=(Archived copy of) Royal Pardon for Alan Turing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=turingindependent24dec2013&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/alan-turing-gets-his-royal-pardon-for-gross-indecency--61-years-after-he-poisoned-himself-9023116.html|title=Alan Turing gets his royal pardon for 'gross indecency' – 61 years after he poisoned himself|work=The Independent|date=23 December 2013|author= Wright, Oliver|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and family==
Turing was born in [[Paddington]], [[London]], while his father, Julius Mathison Turing (1873–1947), was on leave from his position with the [[Indian Civil Service]] (ICS) at [[Chhatrapur]], [[Bihar and Orissa Province]], in [[British India]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Hodges1983P5&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/scrapbook/early.html |title=The Alan Turing Internet Scrapbook |publisher=Turing.org.uk |accessdate=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing's father was the son of a clergyman from a Scottish family of merchants which had been based in the [[Netherlands]] and included a [[baronet]]. Turing's mother, Julius' wife, was Ethel Sara (née Stoney; 1881–1976), daughter of Edward Waller Stoney, chief engineer of the [[Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway|Madras Railways]]. The Stoneys were a [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestant]] [[Anglo-Irish]] [[gentry]] family from both [[County Tipperary]] and [[County Longford]], while Ethel herself had spent much of her childhood in [[County Clare]].&lt;ref&gt;Phil Maguire, &quot;An Irishman's Diary&quot;, page 5. ''[[The Irish Times]]'', 23 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Turing as a toddler.jpg|thumb|left|Turing, age 5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outcry over Govt rejection of Alan Turing Pardon|url=http://universal-machine.blogspot.com/2012/02/outcry-over-govt-rejection-of-alan.html|website=Universal Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Julius' work with the ICS brought the family to British India, where his grandfather had been a general in the [[Bengal Army]]. However, both Julius and Ethel wanted their children to be brought up in England, so they moved to [[Maida Vale]],&lt;ref name=&quot;englishheritaget&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/server/show/nav.001002006005/chooseLetter/T | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5jkyjSdgY | archivedate = 13 September 2009 | title = London Blue Plaques | accessdate =10 February 2007 | work=English Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt; London, where Turing was born on 23 June 1912, as recorded by a [[blue plaque]] on the outside of the house of his birth,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.nature.com/london/2011/03/16/the-scientific-tourist-in-london-17-alan-turings-birth-place The Scientific Tourist In London: #17 Alan Turing's Birth Place], Nature.com London Blog&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{openplaque|381}}&lt;/ref&gt; later the [[Colonnade Hotel (London)|Colonnade Hotel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodges1983P5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;turingorguk&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/scrapbook/memorial.html | title=The Alan Turing Internet Scrapbook | accessdate=26 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had an elder brother, John (the father of Sir John Dermot Turing, 12th Baronet of the [[Turing baronets]]).

His father's civil service commission was still active; and, during Turing's childhood years, Turing's parents travelled between [[Hastings]] in England&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and India, leaving their two sons to stay with a retired [[British Army|Army]] couple. At Hastings, Turing stayed at Baston Lodge, Upper Maze Hill, [[St Leonards-on-Sea]], now marked with a blue plaque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baston Lodge|url=http://www.primelocation.com/for-sale/details/33060901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Very early in life, Turing showed signs of the genius that he was later to display prominently.&lt;ref name=toolbox&gt;{{cite web|title=Alan Turing&amp;nbsp;– Towards a Digital Mind: Part 1 |first=G. James |last=Jones |date=11 December 2001 |url=http://www.systemtoolbox.com/article.php?history_id=3 |accessdate=27 July 2007 |work=System Toolbox| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070803163318/http://www.systemtoolbox.com/article.php?history_id=3| archivedate= 3 August 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents purchased a house in [[Guildford]] in 1927, and Turing lived there during school holidays. The location is also marked with a blue plaque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Name * |url=http://www.guildford-dragon.com/2012/11/29/founder-of-computer-science-alan-turings-guildford-stargazing/ |title=Guildford Dragon NEWS |publisher=The Guildford Dragon |date=29 November 2012 |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
{{Double image|right|Turing_at_Sherborne.jpg|130|Christopher_Morcom_at_Sherborne.jpg|150|Turing (''left'') and first love Christopher Morcom (''right'') at Sherborne School&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poor Imitation of Alan Turing|url=http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2014/dec/19/poor-imitation-alan-turing/|website=New York Review of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}Turing's parents enrolled him at St Michael's, a day school at 20 Charles Road, [[St Leonards-on-Sea]], at the age of six. The headmistress recognised his talent early on, as did many of his subsequent educators. In 1926, at the age of 13, he went on to [[Sherborne School]], a well known independent school in the [[market town]] of [[Sherborne]] in Dorset. The first day of term coincided with the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|1926 General Strike]] in Britain, but he was so determined to attend that he rode his bicycle unaccompanied more than {{convert|60|mi|km}} from [[Southampton]] to Sherborne, stopping overnight at an inn.&lt;ref name=metamagical&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metamagical Themas: Questing for the Essence of Mind and Pattern |first=Douglas R. |last=Hofstadter |year=1985 |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-465-04566-9 |oclc=230812136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing's natural inclination toward mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some of the teachers at Sherborne, whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the [[classics]]. His headmaster wrote to his parents: &quot;I hope he will not fall between two stools. If he is to stay at public school, he must aim at becoming ''educated''. If he is to be solely a ''Scientific Specialist'', he is wasting his time at a public school&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Turing continued to show remarkable ability in the studies he loved, solving advanced problems in 1927 without having studied even elementary [[calculus]]. In 1928, aged 16, Turing encountered [[Albert Einstein]]'s work; not only did he grasp it, but he extrapolated Einstein's questioning of [[Newton's laws of motion]] from a text in which this was never made explicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Sherborne, Turing formed an important friendship with fellow pupil Christopher Morcom, which provided inspiration in Turing's future endeavours. However, the friendship was cut short by Morcom's death in February 1930 from complications of [[bovine tuberculosis]] contracted after drinking infected cow's milk some years previously.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Hassall, [http://oldshirburnian.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/The-Sherborne-Formula-Vivat-2012-2013-optimised.pdf 'The Sherborne Formula: The Making of Alan Turing'] 'Vivat!' 2012/13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=teuscher&gt;{{Cite book|last=Teuscher |first=Christof (ed.) |authorlink=Christof Teuscher |title=Alan Turing: Life and Legacy of a Great Thinker |year=2004 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]] |isbn=3-540-20020-7 |oclc=53434737 62339998}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event shattered Turing's religious faith. He became an [[atheist]]. He believed that all [[phenomena]], including the workings of the human brain, must be [[materialism|materialistic]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gray, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990624,00.html Alan Turing] Time Magazine's Most Important People of the Century, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

===University and work on computability===
After Sherborne, Turing studied as an undergraduate from 1931 to 1934 at [[King's College, Cambridge]], from where he gained first-class honours in mathematics. In 1935, at the young age of 22, he was elected a [[fellow]] at King's on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the [[central limit theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;See Section 3 of John Aldrich, &quot;England and Continental Probability in the Inter-War Years&quot;, Journal Electronique d'Histoire des Probabilités et de la Statistique, vol. 5/2 [http://www.jehps.net/decembre2009.html Decembre 2009] Journal Electronique d'Histoire des Probabilités et de la Statistique&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that he had failed to find out that it had already been proved in 1922 by [[Jarl Waldemar Lindeberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=88,94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, German mathematician [[David Hilbert]] had called attention to the ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' (decision problem). In his momentous paper &quot;On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the ''Entscheidungsproblem''&quot; (submitted on 28 May 1936 and delivered 12 November),&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turing|1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing reformulated [[Kurt Gödel]]'s 1931 results on the limits of proof and computation, replacing Gödel's universal arithmetic-based formal language with the formal and simple hypothetical devices that became known as [[Turing machine]]s. He proved that some such machine would be capable of performing any conceivable mathematical computation if it were representable as an [[algorithm]]. He went on to prove that there was no solution to the ''Entscheidungsproblem'' by first showing that the [[halting problem]] for Turing machines is [[Decision problem|undecidable]]: in general, it is not possible to decide algorithmically whether a given Turing machine will ever halt.
[[File:20130808 Kings College Front Court Fountain Crop 03.jpg|thumb|left|[[King's College, Cambridge]], where the computer room is named after Turing, who became a student there in 1931 and a Fellow in 1935]]
Although Turing's proof was published shortly after [[Alonzo Church]]'s equivalent proof&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Church|1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; using his [[lambda calculus]], Turing had been unaware of Church's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing's approach is considerably more accessible and intuitive than Church's. It was also novel in its notion of a 'Universal Machine' (now known as a [[universal Turing machine]]), with the idea that such a machine could perform the tasks of any other computation machine, or in other words, it is [[formal proof|provably]] capable of computing anything that is computable. [[John von Neumann|Von Neumann]] acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;von Neumann&amp;nbsp;... firmly emphasised to me, and to others I am sure, that the fundamental conception is owing to Turing—insofar as not anticipated by Babbage, Lovelace and others.&quot; Letter by [[Stanley Frankel]] to [[Brian Randell]], 1972, quoted in [[Jack Copeland]] (2004) ''The Essential Turing'', p22.&lt;/ref&gt; Turing machines are to this day a central object of study in [[theory of computation]].

From September 1936 to July 1938, Turing spent most of his time studying under Church at [[Princeton University]]. In addition to his purely mathematical work, he studied cryptology and also built three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1938, he obtained his PhD from Princeton;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1112/plms/s2-45.1.161}}&lt;/ref&gt; his dissertation, ''[[Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;turingphd&quot;&gt;{{TuringPhD}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Turing | first = A. M. | author-link = Alan Turing | title = Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals | year = 1938 | url = https://webspace.princeton.edu/users/jedwards/Turing%20Centennial%202012/Mudd%20Archive%20files/12285_AC100_Turing_1938.pdf | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the concept of [[ordinal logic]] and the notion of [[Turing reduction|relative computing]], where Turing machines are augmented with so-called [[oracle machine|oracles]], allowing a study of problems that cannot be solved by a Turing machine.

When Turing returned to Cambridge, he attended lectures given in 1939 by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] about the [[foundations of mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remarkably, the lectures have been reconstructed verbatim, including interjections from Turing and other students, from students' notes.&lt;ref&gt;ed. [[Cora Diamond]]: ''Wittgenstein's Lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics'', University of Chicago Press, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; Turing and Wittgenstein argued and disagreed, with Turing defending [[Philosophy of mathematics#Formalism|formalism]] and Wittgenstein propounding his view that mathematics does not discover any absolute truths but rather invents them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also started to work part-time with the [[Government Code and Cypher School#Government Communications Headquarters|Government Code and Cypher School (GC&amp;CS)]].

==Cryptanalysis==
During the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at [[Bletchley Park]]. The historian and wartime codebreaker [[Asa Briggs]] has said, &quot;You needed exceptional talent, you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing's was that genius.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite AV media | last = Briggs | first = Asa | author-link = Asa Briggs, Baron Briggs | title = Britain's Greatest Codebreaker | type=TV broadcast | publisher = [[Channel 4|UK Channel 4]] | date=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From September 1938, Turing had been working part-time with the [[Government Code and Cypher School#Government Communications Headquarters|GC&amp;CS]], the British code breaking organisation. He concentrated on [[cryptanalysis of the Enigma]], with [[Dilly Knox]], a senior GC&amp;CS codebreaker.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Copeland|Copeland, Jack]], &quot;Colossus and the Dawning of the Computer Age&quot;, p. 352 in ''Action This Day'', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the July 1939 [[Warsaw]] meeting at which the [[Polish Cipher Bureau]] had provided the British and French with the details of the wiring of [[Enigma rotor details|Enigma rotors]] and their method of decrypting Enigma messages, Turing and Knox started to work on a less fragile approach to the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2004a|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish method relied on an insecure [[Cryptanalysis#Indicator|indicator]] procedure that the Germans were likely to change, which they did in May 1940. Turing's approach was more general, using [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#Crib-based decryption|crib-based decryption]] for which he produced the functional specification of the [[bombe]] (an improvement of the Polish [[Bomba (cryptography)|Bomba]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Clark |first=Liat |url=http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-06/18/turing-contributions?page=all |title=Turing's achievements: codebreaking, AI and the birth of computer science (Wired UK) |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date=18 June 2012 |accessdate=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Turing flat.jpg|thumb|right|Two cottages in the stable yard at [[Bletchley Park]]. Turing worked here in 1939 and 1940, before moving to [[Hut 8]].]]
On 4 September 1939, the day after the UK declared war on Germany, Turing reported to Bletchley Park, the wartime station of GC&amp;CS.&lt;ref name=Copeland2006p378&gt;Copeland, 2006 p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt;
Specifying the bombe was the first of five major cryptanalytical advances that Turing made during the war. The others were: deducing the indicator procedure used by the German navy; developing a statistical procedure for making much more efficient use of the bombes dubbed ''[[Banburismus]]''; developing a procedure for working out the cam settings of the wheels of the [[Lorenz SZ 40/42]] (''Tunny'') dubbed ''[[Turingery]]'' and, towards the end of the war, the development of a portable [[secure voice]] scrambler at [[Her Majesty's Government Communications Centre|Hanslope Park]] that was codenamed ''Delilah''.

By using statistical techniques to optimise the trial of different possibilities in the code breaking process, Turing made an innovative contribution to the subject. He wrote two papers discussing mathematical approaches which were entitled ''Report on the applications of probability to cryptography''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Turing | first = Alan | year = c. 1941 | title = Report on the applications of probability to cryptography | id = The National Archives of the UK: HW 25/37| url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/news/705.htm | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Paper on statistics of repetitions'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Turing | first = Alan | year = c. 1941 | title = Paper on statistics of repetitions | id = The National Archives of the UK: HW 25/38 |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/news/705.htm | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; which were of such value to GC&amp;CS and its successor [[Government Communications Headquarters|GCHQ]], that they were not released to the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|UK National Archives]] until April 2012, shortly before the centenary of his birth. A GCHQ mathematician said at the time that the fact that the contents had been restricted for some 70 years demonstrated their importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vallance |first=Chris |title=Alan Turing papers on code breaking released by GCHQ |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17771962|accessdate=20 April 2012 |newspaper=BBC News |date=19 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing had something of a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park. He was known to his colleagues as 'Prof' and his treatise on Enigma was known as 'The Prof's Book'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[I.J. Good|Jack Good]], a cryptanalyst who worked with him, is quoted by [[Ronald Lewin]] as having said of Turing:

{{quote|In the first week of June each year he would get a bad attack of hay fever, and he would cycle to the office wearing a service gas mask to keep the pollen off. His bicycle had a fault: the chain would come off at regular intervals. Instead of having it mended he would count the number of times the pedals went round and would get off the bicycle in time to adjust the chain by hand. Another of his eccentricities is that he chained his mug to the radiator pipes to prevent it being stolen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewin|1978|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1945, Turing was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] by King [[George VI]] for his wartime services, but his work remained secret for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Alan Turing: Colleagues share their memories | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-18541715 | date = 23 June 2012 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bombe===
Within weeks of arriving at Bletchley Park,&lt;ref name=Copeland2006p378 /&gt; Turing had specified an electromechanical machine that could help break Enigma more effectively than the Polish ''[[bomba (cryptography)|bomba kryptologiczna]]'', from which its name was derived.  The bombe, with an enhancement suggested by mathematician [[Gordon Welchman]], became one of the primary tools, and the major automated one, used to attack Enigma-enciphered messages.

Jack Good opined:

{{quote|Turing's most important contribution, I ''think'', was of part of the design of the bombe, the cryptanalytic machine. He had the idea that you could use, in effect, a theorem in logic which sounds to the untrained ear rather absurd; namely that from a contradiction, you can deduce ''everything.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1155383/episodes &quot;The Men Who Cracked Enigma&quot;], Episode 4 in the UKTV History Channel documentary series [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1157073/ &quot;Heroes of World War II&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Bombe-rebuild.jpg|thumbnail|left|A complete and working replica of a [[bombe]] at the National Codes Centre at Bletchley Park]]
The bombe searched for possible correct settings used for an Enigma message (i.e. rotor order, rotor settings and plugboard settings), using a suitable ''[[crib (cryptanalysis)|crib]]'': a fragment of probable [[plaintext]]. For each possible setting of the rotors (which had of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt; states, or 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; for the four-rotor U-boat variant),&lt;ref&gt;Professor Jack Good in &quot;The Men Who Cracked Enigma&quot;, 2003: with his caveat: &quot;if my memory is correct&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; the bombe performed a chain of logical deductions based on the crib, implemented electrically. The bombe detected when a contradiction had occurred, and ruled out that setting, moving on to the next. Most of the possible settings would cause contradictions and be discarded, leaving only a few to be investigated in detail. The first bombe was installed on 18 March 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oakley|2006|p=40/03B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1941, Turing and his fellow cryptanalysts Gordon Welchman, [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]], and [[Stuart Milner-Barry]] were frustrated. Building on the [[Biuro Szyfrów#Gift to allies|brilliant work of the Poles]], they had set up a good working system for decrypting Enigma signals but they only had a few people and a few bombes so they did not have time to translate all the signals. In the summer they had had considerable success and shipping losses had fallen to under 100,000 tons a month but they were still on a knife-edge. They badly needed more resources to keep abreast of German adjustments. They had tried to get more people and fund more bombes through the proper channels but they were getting nowhere. Finally, breaking all the rules, on 28 October they wrote directly to Churchill spelling out their difficulties, with Turing as the first named. They emphasised how small their need was compared with the vast expenditure of men and money by the forces and compared with the level of assistance they could offer to the forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Andrew Hodges]], biographer of Turing, later wrote, &quot;This letter had an electric effect.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodges 1983 221&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill wrote a memo to [[Hastings Ismay, 1st Baron Ismay|General Ismay]] which read: &quot;ACTION THIS DAY. Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done.&quot; On  18 November the chief of the secret service reported that every possible measure was being taken.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodges 1983 221&quot;/&gt; The cryptographers at Bletchley Park did not know of the prime minister's response, but as Milner-Barry later recalled, &quot;All that we did notice was that almost from that day the rough ways began miraculously to be made smooth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, ''The Essential Turing'', [http://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~aar/turingletter.pdf pp. 336–337].&lt;/ref&gt; More than two hundred bombes were in operation by the end of the war.&lt;ref name=codebreaker&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Copeland | first1 = Jack | last2 = Proudfoot | first2 = Diane | authorlink = Jack Copeland | title = Alan Turing, Codebreaker and Computer Pioneer | url = http://www.alanturing.net/turing_archive/pages/Reference%20Articles/codebreaker.html | publisher = alanturing.net |date=May 2004 | accessdate =27 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hut 8 and Naval Enigma===
[[File:AlanTuring-Bletchley.jpg|thumbnail|Turing by [[Stephen Kettle]] at Bletchley Park, commissioned by [[Sidney Frank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bletchley Park Unveils Statue Commemorating Alan Turing |url=http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/docview.rhtm/454075 |accessdate=30 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Turing decided to tackle the particularly difficult problem of [[Cryptanalysis of the Enigma#German naval Enigma|German naval Enigma]] &quot;because no one else was doing anything about it and I could have it to myself&quot;.&lt;ref name=MahonP14&gt;{{Harvnb|Mahon|1945|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1939, Turing solved the essential part of the naval [[Enigma machine#Indicator|indicator]] system, which was more complex than the indicator systems used by the other services.&lt;ref name=MahonP14 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|pp=184–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same night he also conceived of the idea of ''[[Banburismus]]'', a sequential statistical technique (what [[Abraham Wald]] later called [[sequential analysis]]) to assist in breaking naval Enigma, &quot;though I was not sure that it would work in practice, and was not in fact sure until some days had actually broken&quot;.&lt;ref name=MahonP14 /&gt; For this he invented a measure of weight of evidence that he called the ''[[Ban (unit)|ban]]''. Banburismus could rule out certain sequences of the Enigma rotors, substantially reducing the time needed to test settings on the bombes.

In 1941, Turing proposed marriage to [[Hut 8]] co-worker [[Joan Clarke]], a fellow mathematician and cryptanalyst, but their engagement was short-lived. After admitting his homosexuality to his fiancée, who was reportedly &quot;unfazed&quot; by the revelation, Turing decided that he could not go through with the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|pp=176–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Joan Clarke (cryptanalyst).jpg|thumbnail|left|180px|[[Joan Clarke|Clarke]], friend and colleague of Turing at [[Hut 8]] whom he proposed marriage to in the spring of 1941&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Leavitt | first = David | authorlink = David Leavitt | year = 2007 | title = The man who knew too much: Alan Turing and the invention of the computer | publisher=Phoenix | isbn = 978-0-7538-2200-5 | pages=176–178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grime |first=James |url=http://aperiodical.com/2014/07/an-alan-turing-expert-watches-the-the-imitation-game-trailer/ |title=An Alan Turing expert watches the &quot;The Imitation Game&quot; trailer |publisher=The Aperiodical |date=24 July 2014 |accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Turing travelled to the United States in November 1942&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=242–245}}&lt;/ref&gt; and worked with US Navy cryptanalysts on Naval Enigma and bombe construction in Washington. He visited their [[United States Naval Computing Machine Laboratory|Computing Machine Laboratory]] at Dayton, Ohio. His reaction to the American Bombe design was far from enthusiastic:

{{quote| It seems a pity for them to go out of their way to build a machine to do all this stopping if it is not necessary. I am now converted to the extent of thinking that starting from scratch on the design of a Bombe, this method is about as good as our own. The American Bombe program was to produce 336 Bombes, one for each wheel order. I used to smile inwardly at the conception of test (of commutators) can hardly be considered conclusive as they were not testing for the bounce with electronic stop finding devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BOMBE PROJECT HISTORY, MAY 44 |url=http://www.daytoncodebreakers.org/depth/bombe_history2/|accessdate=2 May 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During this trip, he also assisted at [[Bell Labs]] with the development of [[secure speech]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=245–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Bletchley Park in March 1943. During his absence, [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]] had officially assumed the position of head of Hut 8, although Alexander had been ''de facto'' head for some time—Turing having little interest in the day-to-day running of the section. Turing became a general consultant for cryptanalysis at Bletchley Park.

Alexander wrote as follows about his contribution:

{{quote|There should be no question in anyone's mind that Turing's work was the biggest factor in Hut 8's success. In the early days he was the only cryptographer who thought the problem worth tackling and not only was he primarily responsible for the main theoretical work within the Hut but he also shared with [[Gordon Welchman|Welchman]] and [[Harold Keen|Keen]] the chief credit for the invention of the Bombe. It is always difficult to say that anyone is absolutely indispensable but if anyone was indispensable to Hut 8 it was Turing. The pioneer's work always tends to be forgotten when experience and routine later make everything seem easy and many of us in Hut 8 felt that the magnitude of Turing's contribution was never fully realised by the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alexander|circa 1945|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Turingery===
In July 1942, Turing devised a technique termed ''[[Turingery]]'' (or jokingly ''Turingismus'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; for use against the [[Lorenz cipher]] messages produced by the Germans' new ''Geheimschreiber'' (secret writer) machine. This was a [[teleprinter]] [[Rotor machine|rotor cipher attachment]] codenamed ''Tunny'' at Bletchley Park. Turingery was a method of ''wheel-breaking'', i.e. a procedure for working out the cam settings of Tunny's wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also introduced the Tunny team to [[Tommy Flowers]] who, under the guidance of [[Max Newman]], went on to build the [[Colossus computer]], the world's first programmable digital electronic computer, which replaced a simpler prior machine (the [[Heath Robinson (codebreaking machine)|Heath Robinson]]), and whose superior speed allowed the statistical decryption techniques to be applied usefully to the messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have mistakenly said that Turing was a key figure in the design of the Colossus computer. Turingery and the statistical approach of Banburismus undoubtedly fed into the thinking about [[cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gannon|2007|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hilton|2006|pp=197–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was not directly involved in the Colossus development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|pp=382, 383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delilah===
Following his work at Bell Labs in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=245–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing pursued the idea of electronic enciphering of speech in the telephone system, and in the latter part of the war, he moved to work for the Secret Service's Radio Security Service (later [[Her Majesty's Government Communications Centre|HMGCC]]) at [[Hanslope Park]]. There he further developed his knowledge of electronics with the assistance of engineer Donald Bayley. Together they undertook the design and construction of a portable [[secure voice]] communications machine codenamed ''Delilah''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended for different applications, lacking capability for use with long-distance radio transmissions, and in any case, Delilah was completed too late to be used during the war. Though the system worked fully, with Turing demonstrating it to officials by encrypting and decrypting a recording of a [[Winston Churchill]] speech, Delilah was not adopted for use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing also consulted with [[Bell Labs]] on the development of [[SIGSALY]], a secure voice system that was used in the later years of the war.

==Early computers and the Turing test==
From 1945 to 1947, Turing lived in [[Hampton, London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{openplaque|1619}}&lt;/ref&gt; while he worked on the design of the [[ACE (computer)|ACE]] (Automatic Computing Engine) at the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory (NPL)]]. He presented a paper on 19 February 1946, which was the first detailed design of a [[stored-program computer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Von Neumann]]'s incomplete ''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]'' had predated Turing's paper, but it was much less detailed and, according to [[John R. Womersley]], Superintendent of the NPL Mathematics Division, it &quot;contains a number of ideas which are Dr. Turing's own&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Randell | first = B | author-link = Brian Randell | title = A History of Computing in the Twentieth Century: Colossus | year = 1980 | url = http://www.cs.ncl.ac.uk/research/pubs/books/papers/133.pdf | accessdate =27 January 2012 | ref = harv }} citing {{Cite journal | last = Womersley | first = J.

Womersley | title = 'ACE' Machine Project | journal=Executive Committee, National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, Middlesex | date = 13 February 1946 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ACE was a feasible design, the secrecy surrounding the wartime work at Bletchley Park led to delays in starting the project and he became disillusioned. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year during which he produced a seminal work on ''Intelligent Machinery'' that was not published in his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Copeland|2004b|pp=410–432}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was at Cambridge, the [[Pilot ACE]] was being built in his absence. It executed its first program on 10 May 1950. Although the full version of Turing's ACE was never built, a number of computers around the world owe much to it, for example, the [[English Electric DEUCE]] and the American [[Bendix G-15]].

According to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer [[Heinz Billing]] from the [[Max Planck Institute for Physics]], published by Genscher, Düsseldorf (1997), there was a meeting between Alan Turing and [[Konrad Zuse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathcomp.leeds.ac.uk/turing2012/Images/Turing_Zuse.pdf|title=Did Alan Turing interrogate Konrad Zuse in Göttingen in 1947?|author=Bruderer, Herbert |accessdate= 7 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took place in [[Göttingen]] in 1947. The interrogation had the form of a colloquium. Participants were [[John R. Womersley|Womersley]], Turing, Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse, Walther, and Billing. (For more details see Herbert Bruderer, ''Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz'').

In 1948, Turing was appointed [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in the [[School of Mathematics, University of Manchester|Mathematics Department]] at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]]. In 1949, he became Deputy Director of the Computing Laboratory there, working on software for one of the earliest [[Von Neumann architecture|stored-program]] computers—the [[Manchester Mark 1]]. During this time he continued to do more abstract work in mathematics,&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1093/qjmam/1.1.287&quot;&gt;{{Cite doi|10.1093/qjmam/1.1.287}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in &quot;[[Computing machinery and intelligence]]&quot; (''Mind'', October 1950), Turing addressed the problem of [[artificial intelligence]], and proposed an experiment which became known as the [[Turing test]], an attempt to define a standard for a machine to be called &quot;intelligent&quot;. The idea was that a computer could be said to &quot;think&quot; if a human interrogator could not tell it apart, through conversation, from a human being.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stevan Harnad|Harnad, Stevan]] (2008) [http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/7741 The Annotation Game: On Turing (1950) on Computing, Machinery and Intelligence]. In: Epstein, Robert &amp; Peters, Grace (Eds.) ''Parsing the Turing Test: Philosophical and Methodological Issues in the Quest for the Thinking Computer''. Springer&lt;/ref&gt; In the paper, Turing suggested that rather than building a program to simulate the adult mind, it would be better rather to produce a simpler one to simulate a child's mind and then to subject it to a course of education. A [[Turing test#Reverse Turing test and CAPTCHA|reversed]] form of the Turing test is widely used on the Internet; the [[CAPTCHA]] test is intended to determine whether the user is a human or a computer.

In 1948, Turing, working with his former undergraduate colleague, [[D. G. Champernowne]], began writing a [[chess]] program for a computer that did not yet exist. By 1950, the program was completed and dubbed the Turbochamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Liat|title=Turing's achievements: codebreaking, AI and the birth of computer science|url=http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-06/18/turing-contributions?page=all|publisher=Wired|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, he tried to implement it on a [[Ferranti Mark 1]], but lacking enough power, the computer was unable to execute the program. Instead, Turing played a game in which he simulated the computer, taking about half an hour per move. The game was recorded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1356927 Alan Turing vs Alick Glennie (1952) &quot;Turing Test&quot;] Chessgames.com&lt;/ref&gt; The program lost to Turing's colleague [[Alick Glennie]], although it is said that it won a game against Champernowne's wife.

His Turing test was a significant, characteristically provocative and lasting contribution to the debate regarding artificial intelligence, which continues after more than half a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1023/A:1011288000451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also invented the [[LU decomposition]] method in 1948,&lt;ref name=&quot;doi10.1093/qjmam/1.1.287&quot;/&gt; used today for solving matrix equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intusoft.com/nlhtm/nl71.htm |title=SPICE 1 2 3 and beyond&amp;nbsp;...

==Pattern formation and mathematical biology==
Turing worked from 1952 until his death in 1954 on [[Mathematical and theoretical biology|mathematical biology]], specifically [[morphogenesis]]. He published one paper on the subject called ''[[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis]]'' in 1952, putting forth the Turing hypothesis of pattern formation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite doi|10.1098/rstb.1952.0012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Control Mechanism For Biological Pattern Formation Decoded&quot; ''ScienceDaily'', 30 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; (the theory was experimentally confirmed 60 years after his death&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tompkins, Li, et al|title=Testing Turing's theory of morphogenesis in chemical cells|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=10 March 2014|doi=10.1073/pnas.1322005111|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/03/05/1322005111.abstract?sid=44d2b445-66f5-4dd1-b1c0-d6c25e88accb|accessdate=18 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;). His central interest in the field was understanding [[Leonardo of Pisa|Fibonacci]] [[phyllotaxis]], the existence of [[Fibonacci number]]s in plant structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turing's achievements: codebreaking, AI and the birth of computer science|url=http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-06/18/turing-contributions?page=all|work=wired.co.uk|accessdate=12 February 2013|author= Clark, Liat|author2=Ian Steadman|date=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He used [[Reaction–diffusion system|reaction–diffusion equations]] which are central to the field of [[pattern formation]]. Later papers went unpublished until 1992 when ''Collected Works of A.M. Turing'' was published. His contribution is considered a seminal piece of work in this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback |df=yes|url=http://www.swintons.net/deodands/archives/000087.html |title=Turing's Last, Lost work |date=20030823032620}}&lt;/ref&gt; Removal of ''Hox'' genes causes an increased number of digits (up to 14) in mice, demonstrating a Turing-type mechanism in the development of the hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite doi|10.1126/science.1226804}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conviction for indecency==
In January 1952, Turing, then 39, started a relationship with Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man. Turing met Murray just before Christmas outside the Regal Cinema when walking down Manchester's [[Wilmslow Road|Oxford Road]] and had invited him to lunch. On 23 January Turing's house was burgled. Murray told Turing that the burglar was an acquaintance of his, and Turing reported the crime to the police. During the investigation he acknowledged a sexual relationship with Murray. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=458}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both men were charged with gross indecency under [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885#Section 11|Section 11]] of the [[Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885]].&lt;ref name=LeavittP268&gt;{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial [[committal procedure|committal proceedings]] for the trial were held on 27 February, where Turing's solicitor &quot;reserved his defence&quot;.

Later, convinced by the advice of his brother and other lawyers, Turing entered a plea of &quot;guilty&quot;, in spite of the fact that he felt no remorse or guilt for having committed acts of homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Alan Turing: The Enigma |authorlink=Andrew Hodges |last=Hodges |first=Andrew |year=1992 |page=463 |date=27 May 2012 |isbn=0-691-15564-X |url=http://books.google.com/?id=HyMcH_9eTtoC&amp;pg=PA463&amp;dq=%2227+february%22+%22alan+turing%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%2227%20february%22%20%22alan%20turing%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case, ''[[Elizabeth II|Regina]] v.

Turing's conviction led to the removal of his security clearance and barred him from continuing with his cryptographic consultancy for the [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)]], the British [[signals intelligence]] agency that had evolved from GC&amp;CS in 1946 (though he kept his academic job). He was denied entry into the United States after his conviction in 1952, but was free to visit other European countries, even though this was viewed by some as a security risk. At the time, there was acute public anxiety about homosexual entrapment of spies by Soviet agents,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|p=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the recent exposure of the first two members of the [[Cambridge Five]], [[Guy Burgess]] and [[Donald Duart Maclean|Donald Maclean]], as [[KGB]] [[double agent]]s. Turing was never accused of espionage, but in common with all who had worked at Bletchley Park, he was prevented by the [[Official Secrets Act]] from discussing his war work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Copeland|2006|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 8 June 1954, Turing's housekeeper found him dead. He had died the previous day. A [[post-mortem]] examination established that the cause of death was [[cyanide poisoning]]. When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=488}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was speculated that this was the means by which a fatal dose was consumed. An [[Inquests in England and Wales|inquest]] determined that he had committed suicide, and he was cremated at [[Woking Crematorium]] on 12 June 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|p=529}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing's ashes were scattered there, just as his father's had been.

Philosophy professor [[Jack Copeland]] has questioned various aspects of the coroner's historical verdict, suggesting the alternative explanation of the accidental inhalation of cyanide fumes from an apparatus for gold [[electroplating]] spoons, using potassium cyanide to [[Gold#Commercial chemistry|dissolve the gold]], which Turing had set up in his tiny spare room. Copeland notes that the autopsy findings were more consistent with inhalation than with ingestion of the poison. Turing also habitually ate an apple before bed, and it was not unusual for it to be discarded half-eaten.&lt;ref name = &quot;Copeland&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | first = Roland | last = Pease | title = Alan Turing: Inquest's suicide verdict 'not supportable' | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18561092 | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | date = 23 June 2012 | accessdate =23 June 2012 | quote = ''We have&amp;nbsp;... been recreating the narrative of Turing's life, and we have recreated him as an unhappy young man who committed suicide. But the evidence is not there&quot;''
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Turing had reportedly borne his legal setbacks and hormone treatment (which had been discontinued a year previously) &quot;with good humour&quot; and had shown no sign of despondency prior to his death, setting down, in fact, a list of tasks he intended to complete upon return to his office after the holiday weekend.&lt;ref name = &quot;Copeland&quot;/&gt; At the time, Turing's mother believed that the ingestion was accidental, resulting from her son's careless storage of laboratory chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Robin Gandy, 28 July 1954, http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/books-manuscripts/turing-ethel-sara-series-of-11-5685694-details.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer [[Andrew Hodges]] suggests that Turing may have arranged the cyanide experiment deliberately, to give his mother some [[plausible deniability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=488, 489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing's biographers [[Andrew Hodges]] and [[David Leavitt]] have suggested that Turing was re-enacting a scene from the 1937 [[Walt Disney]] film ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]'', his favourite [[fairy tale]], both noting that (in Leavitt's words) he took &quot;an especially keen pleasure in the scene where the Wicked Queen immerses her apple in the poisonous brew&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Leavitt|2007|p=140}} and {{Harvnb|Hodges|1983|pp=149, 489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition and tributes==
A biography published by the [[Royal Society]] shortly after Turing's death, while his wartime work was still subject to the [[Official Secrets Act]], recorded:
{{quote| Three remarkable papers written just before the war, on three diverse mathematical subjects, show the quality of the work that might have been produced if he had settled down to work on some big problem at that critical time. For his work at the Foreign Office he was awarded the OBE.&lt;ref name=&quot;frs&quot;/&gt;}}
Since 1966, the [[Turing Award]] has been given annually by the [[Association for Computing Machinery|Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)]] for technical or theoretical contributions to the computing community. It is widely considered to be the computing world's highest honour, equivalent to the Nobel Prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acm.org/press-room/news-releases-2007/turingaward/|title=ACM'S Turing Award Prize Raised To $250,000|publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] press release|date=27 July 2007|accessdate=16 October 2008|author= Geringer, Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Breaking the Code]]'' is a 1986 play by [[Hugh Whitemore]] about Alan Turing. The play ran in [[West End theatre|London's West End]] beginning in November 1986 and on Broadway from 15 November 1987 to 10 April 1988. There was also a 1996 [[BBC]] television production (broadcast in the United States by [[PBS]]). In all three performances Turing was played by [[Derek Jacobi]]. The Broadway production was nominated for three [[Tony Award]]s including Best Actor in a Play, Best Featured Actor in a Play, and Best Direction of a Play, and for two [[Drama Desk Award]]s, for Best Actor and Best Featured Actor.

On 13 March 2000, [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] issued a set of postage stamps to celebrate the greatest achievements of the 20th century, one of which carries a portrait of Turing against a background of repeated 0s and 1s, and is captioned: &quot;1937: Alan Turing's theory of digital computing&quot;. On 1 April 2003, Turing's work at [[Bletchley Park]] was named an [[List of IEEE milestones|IEEE Milestone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Code-breaking_at_Bletchley_Park_during_World_War_II,_1939-1945 |title=Milestones:Code-breaking at Bletchley Park during World War II, 1939–1945 |author=IEEE History Center |year=2003 |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 October 2004, a bronze statue of Alan Turing sculpted by [[John W.

Turing was one of four mathematicians examined in the 2008 BBC documentary entitled ''Dangerous Knowledge''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/dangerous-knowledge.shtml|title=Dangerous Knowledge|publisher=BBC Four|date=11 June 2008|accessdate=25 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Princeton Alumni Weekly named Turing the second most significant alumnus in the history of [[Princeton University]], second only to President [[James Madison]]. A 1.5-ton, life-size statue of Turing was unveiled on 19 June 2007 at Bletchley Park. Built from approximately half a million pieces of Welsh [[slate]], it was sculpted by [[Stephen Kettle]], having been commissioned by the late American billionaire [[Sidney Frank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/docview.rhtm/454075/article.html Bletchley Park Unveils Statue Commemorating Alan Turing], Bletchley Park press release, 20 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Turing has been honoured in various ways in [[Manchester]], the city where he worked towards the end of his life. In 1994, a stretch of the [[A6010 road]] (the [[Manchester]] city intermediate ring road) was named &quot;Alan Turing Way&quot;. A bridge carrying this road was widened, and carries the name Alan Turing Bridge. A [[Alan Turing Memorial|statue of Turing]] was unveiled in Manchester on 23 June 2001 in [[Sackville Park]], between the [[University of Manchester]] building on Whitworth Street and [[Canal Street, Manchester|Canal Street]]. The memorial statue depicts the &quot;father of Computer Science&quot; sitting on a bench at a central position in the park. Turing is shown holding an apple. The cast bronze bench carries in relief the text 'Alan Mathison Turing 1912–1954', and the motto 'Founder of Computer Science' as it could appear if encoded by an [[Enigma machine]]: 'IEKYF ROMSI ADXUO KVKZC GUBJ'.
[[File:Sackville Park Turing plaque.jpg|thumb|right|Turing memorial statue plaque in [[Sackville Park]], Manchester]]
A plaque at the statue's feet reads 'Father of computer science, mathematician, logician, wartime codebreaker, victim of prejudice'. There is also a [[Bertrand Russell]] quotation saying 'Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty — a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture.' The sculptor buried his own old [[Amstrad]] computer, the earliest mouse-equipped home computer, under the [[plinth]] as a tribute to &quot;the godfather of all modern computers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerburied&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/computer-buried-in-tribute-to-genius-1186583 | title=Computer buried in tribute to genius | work=Manchester Evening News | date=17 February 2007 | accessdate=7 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'' named Turing as one of the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|100 Most Important People of the 20th century]] and stated: &quot;The fact remains that everyone who taps at a keyboard, opening a spreadsheet or a word-processing program, is working on an incarnation of a Turing machine.&quot;&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;{{cite news| title =Alan Turing&amp;nbsp;– Time 100 People of the Century |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990624,00.html |work=Time Magazine |quote=Providing a blueprint for the electronic digital computer. The fact remains that everyone who taps at a keyboard, opening a spreadsheet or a word-processing program, is working on an incarnation of a Turing machine. |first=Paul |last=Gray |date=29 March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turing is featured in the 1999 [[Neal Stephenson]] novel ''[[Cryptonomicon]]''.

In 2002, a new building named after Alan Turing was constructed on the Malvern site of [[QinetiQ]]. It houses about 200 scientists and engineers, some of whom work on [[big data]] computing.

In 2002, Turing was ranked twenty-first on the BBC nationwide poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2208671.stm | title = 100 great British heroes | date = 21 August 2002 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 British writer and mathematician [[Ioan James]] chose Turing as one of twenty people to feature in his book about famous historical figures who may have had some of the traits of [[Asperger syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= James, Ioan M.|title=Asperger's Syndrome and High Achievement|url=http://books.google.com/?id=SZ-p4GOdJIgC|publisher=Jessica Kingsley|year=2006|isbn=978-1-84310-388-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, actor/playwright [[Jade Esteban Estrada]] portrayed Turing in the solo musical, ''ICONS: The Lesbian and Gay History of the World, Vol. 4''. In 2011, in ''[[The Guardian]]'s'' &quot;My hero&quot; series, writer [[Alan Garner]] chose Turing as his hero and described how they had met whilst out jogging in the early 1950s. Garner remembered Turing as &quot;funny and witty&quot; and said that he &quot;talked endlessly&quot;.

Turing's life and work featured in a BBC children's programme about famous scientists – [[Absolute Genius with Dick and Dom]] – the episode was first broadcast on 12 March 2014.

On 17 May 2014, the world's first work of public art to recognise Alan Turing as gay was commissioned in Bletchley, close by to Bletchley Park where his famous work was carried out. The commission was announced by the owners of [[Milton Keynes]]-based LGBT venue and nightclub, Pink Punters to mark International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia.
The work was unveiled at a ceremony on Turing's birthday, 23 June 2014, and is placed outside Pink Punter's alongside the busy Watling Street, the old main road to London where Turing himself would have passed by on many occasions.

On 22 October 2014, Turing was inducted into the [[NSA Hall of Honor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hall of Honor Inductee – Alan Turing – NSA/CSS|url=https://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/hall_of_honor/2014/turing.shtml|publisher=National Security Agency|accessdate=22 November 2014|date=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Press Release – Five Cryptologists Added to NSA/CSS Cryptologic Hall of Honor|url=https://www.nsa.gov/public_info/press_room/2014/Cryptologists_Added_to_Hall_of_Honor.shtml|publisher=National Security Agency|accessdate=22 November 2014|date=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To mark the 100th anniversary of Turing's birth, the Turing Centenary Advisory Committee (TCAC) co-ordinated the [[Alan Turing Year]], a year-long programme of events around the world honouring Turing's life and achievements. The TCAC, chaired by [[S. Barry Cooper]] with Alan Turing's nephew Sir John Dermot Turing acting as Honorary President, worked with the [[University of Manchester]] faculty members and a broad spectrum of people from Cambridge University and [[Bletchley Park]].

On 23 June 2012, [[Google]] featured an interactive [[Google doodle#Google Doodle|doodle]] where visitors had to change the instructions of a Turing Machine, so when run, the symbols on the tape would match a provided sequence, featuring &quot;Google&quot; in [[ITA2|Baudot-Murray code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/technologylive/post/2012/06/google-doodle-honors-alan-turing/1#.T-U2U47igfM |title=Google Doodle honors Alan Turing |publisher=Content.usatoday.com |date= 22 June 2012|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bletchley Park Trust collaborated with [[Winning Moves]] to publish an Alan Turing edition of the board game [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]].

* {{Cite book | last = Turing | first = Sara Stoney | title = Alan M Turing | publisher=W Heffer | year = 1959}} Turing's mother, who survived him by many years, wrote this 157-page biography of her son, glorifying his life. It was published in 1959, and so could not cover his war work. Scarcely 300 copies were sold (Sara Turing to Lyn Newman, 1967, Library of [[St John's College, Cambridge]]). The six-page foreword by [[Lyn Irvine]] includes reminiscences and is more frequently quoted. It was re-published by Cambridge University Press in 2012, to honour the centenary of his birth, and included a new foreword by [[Martin Davis]], as well as a never-before-published memoir by Turing's older brother John F. Turing.
