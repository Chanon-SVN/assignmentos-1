The '''Governor of Alabama''' is the [[Head of government|chief executive]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alabama]]. The [[Governor (United States)|governor]] is the head of the [[executive branch]] of [[Government of Alabama|Alabama's state government]] and is charged with enforcing state laws. The governor has the power to either approve or [[veto]] bills passed by the [[Alabama Legislature]], to convene the legislature, and to grant [[pardon]]s, except in cases of [[impeachment]].&lt;ref&gt;AL Const., art. V.&lt;/ref&gt; The governor is also the [[commander-in-chief]] of the [[U.S. state|state's]] [[Alabama National Guard|military forces]]. 

There have officially been 53 governors of the state of Alabama; this official numbering skips acting and military governors.&lt;ref name=&quot;adah&quot; /&gt; The first governor, [[William Wyatt Bibb]], served as the only governor of the [[Alabama Territory]]. Five people have served as acting governor, bringing the total number of people serving as governor to 58, spread over 63 distinct terms. Four governors have served multiple non-consecutive terms: [[Bibb Graves]], [[Jim Folsom]], and [[Fob James]] each served two, and [[George Wallace]] served three non-consecutive periods. Officially, these non-consecutive terms are numbered only with the number of their first term. [[William D. Jelks]] also served non-consecutive terms, but his first term was in an acting capacity. 

The longest-serving governor was George Wallace, who served sixteen years over four terms. The shortest term for a non-acting governor was that of [[Hugh McVay]], who served four and a half months after replacing the resigning [[Clement Comer Clay]]. [[Lurleen Wallace]], wife of George Wallace, was the first and so far only woman to serve as governor of Alabama, and the third woman to serve as governor of any state. The current governor is Republican [[Robert J. Bentley]], who took office on January 17, 2011.

===Governor of the Territory of Alabama===
:''For the period before Alabama Territory was formed, see the [[list of Governors of Mississippi|list of Governors of Mississippi Territory]].''
[[Alabama Territory]] was formed on March 3, 1817, from [[Mississippi Territory]]. It had only one governor appointed by the [[President of the United States]] before it became a state; he became the first state governor.

===Governors of the State of Alabama===

Alabama was [[List of U.S. states by date of statehood|admitted to the Union]] on December 14, 1819. It seceded from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] on January 11, 1861 and was a founding member of the [[Confederate States of America]] on February 4, 1861; there was no Union Alabama government in exile, so there was a single line of governors. Following the end of the [[American Civil War]], Alabama during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] was part of the [[Third Military District]], which exerted some control over governor appointments and elections. Alabama was readmitted to the Union on July 14, 1868.

The first [[Alabama Constitution]], ratified in 1819, provided that a governor be elected every two years, limited to serve no more than four out of every six years.&lt;ref&gt;1819 Const. art. IV, § 4&lt;/ref&gt; This limit remained in place until the constitution of 1868, which simply allowed governors to serve terms of two years.&lt;ref&gt;1868 Const. art. V, § 2&lt;/ref&gt; The current constitution of 1901 increased terms to four years,&lt;ref&gt;AL Const. art. V, § 114&lt;/ref&gt; but prohibited governors from succeeding themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;const-art5sec116&quot;&gt;AL Const. art. V, § 116&lt;/ref&gt; Amendment 282 to the constitution, passed in 1968, allowed governors to succeed themselves once.&lt;ref&gt;AL Const. amendment 282&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution had no set date for the commencement of a governor's term until 1901, when it was set at the first Monday after the second Tuesday in the January following an election.&lt;ref name=&quot;const-art5sec116&quot; /&gt;

The office of [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama|lieutenant governor]] was created in 1868,&lt;ref name=&quot;1868const-art5sec1&quot;&gt;1868 Const. art. V, § 1&lt;/ref&gt; abolished in 1875,&lt;ref name=&quot;1875const-art5sec1&quot;&gt;1875 Const. art. V, § 1&lt;/ref&gt; and recreated in 1901.&lt;ref name=&quot;const-art5sec112&quot;&gt;AL Const. art. V, § 112&lt;/ref&gt; According to the current constitution, should the governor be out of the state for more than 20 days, the lieutenant governor becomes [[acting governor]], and if the office of governor becomes vacant the lieutenant governor fully becomes governor.&lt;ref&gt;AL Const. art. V, § 127&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier constitutions said the powers of the governor devolved upon the successor, rather than them necessarily becoming governor,&lt;ref&gt;1819 Const. art. IV, § 18; 1861 Const. art. IV, § 18; 1865 Const. art V, § 19; 1868 Const. art. V, § 15; 1875 Const. art. V § 15&lt;/ref&gt; but the official listing includes these as full governors.&lt;ref name=&quot;adah&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.state.al.us/govslist.html |title=Alabama Governors |publisher=[[Alabama Department of Archives and History]] |deadurl=no |accessdate=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governor and lieutenant governor are not elected on the same [[ticket (election)|ticket]].

Alabama was a strongly [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] state before the Civil War, electing only candidates from the [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republican]] and Democratic parties. It had two [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] governors following Reconstruction, but after the Democratic Party re-established control, 112 years passed before voters chose another Republican.

==Other high offices held==
Eighteen of Alabama's governors have served higher federal or [[Confederate States of America|confederate]] offices. All but three were elected to the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]], although one of those represented only [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The remaining three served in the confederate government, two as members of the [[Provisional Confederate Congress]], and one was the [[Confederate States Attorney General]]. One governor served as [[United States Ambassador to Russia|Minister to Russia]]. Two governors (marked with *) resigned to take seats in the Senate, and two (marked with {{dagger}}) resigned their positions to take office as governor. 

Additionally, two governors were elected to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] shortly after the [[American Civil War]], but were did not take office: Lewis E. Parsons was refused his seat because Alabama had not yet been [[Reconstruction era of the United States|reconstructed]], and John A. Winston would not take the oath of allegiance.

All representatives and senators listed represented Alabama except where noted.
