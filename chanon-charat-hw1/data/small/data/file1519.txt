'''Abdülhamid I''', '''Abdul Hamid I''' or '''Abd Al-Hamid I''' ({{lang-ota|عبد الحميد اول}}, ''`Abdü’l-Ḥamīd-i evvel''; {{lang-tr|Birinci Abdülhamit}}; 20 March 1725 – 7 April 1789)&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some sources state 12 March as his day of birth&lt;/ref&gt; was the 27th [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire]]. He was the son of sultan [[Ahmed III]] (1703&amp;ndash;30) and succeeded his brother [[Mustafa III]] (1757–74) on 21 January 1774. He was born in [[Constantinople]]. His mother was [[Rabia Sharmi|Râbi'a Sharmi Sultana]].

==Imprisonment==
Abdülhamid was imprisoned for most of the first forty-two years of his life by his cousins [[Mahmud I]] and [[Osman III]] and his older brother Mustafa III, as was customary. He received his early education from his mother [[Rabia Sharmi|Râbi'a Sharmi Sultana]], from whom he studied history and learned [[calligraphy]].

His imprisonment made him aloof in regard to state affairs and malleable to the designs of his advisors. Yet he was also very religious and a [[pacifism|pacifist]] by nature. At his accession the financial straits of the treasury were such that the usual donative could not be given to the [[Janissary|janissaries]].  War was, however, forced on him and less than a year after his accession the complete defeat of the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] at [[Battle of Kozludzha]] led to the humiliating ''[[treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji|Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca]]'' on 21 July 1774.

In spite of his failures, Abdülhamid was regarded as the most gracious Sultan of the Ottomans. He administered the [[fire brigade]] during the fire in 1782. Among the Muslims of Constantinople, he won the admiration of his people as he was so religious that he was called a &quot;Veli&quot; (saint). He also traced a reform policy, followed the governmental administrations closely and worked with statesmen. When Abdülhamid came to the throne the army asked for gratuities and the sultan claimed that: &quot;There are, no longer, gratuities in our treasury, all of our soldier sons should learn&quot;. He also began the restoration of the military system. He is credited with better education standards. He tried to renovate the Janissary corps and the naval forces. He established a new artillery troop. He made a census in the Janissary corps. He was also credited with the creation of the Imperial Naval Engineering School.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;

He worked on strengthening the Ottoman rule over [[Syria]], [[Egypt]], and [[Iraq]];&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; however slight successes against rebellious outbreaks in [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]] and the [[Ottoman Greece|Morea]] could not compensate for the loss of the [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] which Russia greatly coveted. War was once more declared against Russia in 1787 and in the following year the Russians were joined by [[Habsburg Monarchy|Austria]]. The Swedes and Prussians joined the conflict on the side of the Ottomans, but provided no assistance. While the Ottomans held their own in the conflict they ultimately lost with [[Ochakov]] falling in 1788 to the Russians (all of its inhabitants being massacred.)
In the year 1789, [[Tipu Sultan]] ruler of the [[Sultanate of Mysore]] sent an embassy to the Ottoman capital of [[Constantinople]], to Sultan Abdul Hamid I requesting urgent assistance against the [[British East India Company]] and had proposed an offensive and defensive consortium; Sultan Abdul Hamid I, informed the ambassadors of the [[Sultanate of Mysore]] that the [[Ottoman Empire]] was still recuperating from the [[Austro-Turkish War (1787–91)|Austro-Ottoman War]] and the [[Russo-Turkish Wars]].

Abdülhamid died four months later at the age of sixty-four in Constantinople. He was buried in Bahcekapi, a tomb he had built for himself.
He bred Arabian horses with great passion. After his name was called a Kuhaylan Substrain: &quot; Küheylan Abdülhamid&quot;.

==Family==

His wives were: Valide Sultan [[Ayşe Seniyeperver Sultan|Ayşe Seniyeperver Kadınefendi]], Valide Sultan [[Nakşidil Sultan|Nakşidil Kadın Efendi]]  (there have been speculations that she was a cousin of [[Napoleon]]'s wife [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Josephine]];&lt;ref&gt;Christine Isom-Verhaaren, &quot;Royal French Women in the Ottoman Sultans' Harem: The Political Uses of Fabricated Accounts from the Sixteenth to the Twenty-first Century&quot;, ''[[Journal of World History]]'', vol. 17, No. 2, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; see [[Aimée du Buc de Rivéry]]), Hatice Ruhşah Kadınefendi, Hümaşah Kadınefendi, Ayşe Kadınefendi, Binnaz Kadınefendi, Dilpezir Kadınefendi, Mehtabe Kadınefendi, Mislinayab Kadınefendi, Mûteber Kadınefendi, Nevres Kadınefendi, Fatma Şebsafa Kadınefendi, Mihriban Kadınefendi and Nükhetsezâ Kadınefendi
