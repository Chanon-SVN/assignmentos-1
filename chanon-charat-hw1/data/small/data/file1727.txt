'''Adrian Lamo''' (born February 20, 1981&lt;ref name=&quot;mpalm03&quot;/&gt; in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]) is a [[Colombia]]n-[[United States|American]] [[threat analyst]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/felon |title=Adrian Lamo on Facebook |author= Adrin Lamo |date=November 17, 2013 |accessdate=November 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and former [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-06-04/world/39729591_1_hacker-adrian-lamo-ashden-fein-manning-s |title=Hacker Adrian Lamo testifies at WikiLeaks suspect Bradley Manning's court-martial |publisher=[[Washington Post]] |date=June 4, 2013 |accessdate=September 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamo first gained media attention for breaking into several high-profile computer networks, including those of ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Yahoo!]], and [[Microsoft]], culminating in his 2003 arrest.&lt;ref name=kahn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.04/hacker_pr.html |title=Wired 12.04: The Homeless Hacker v.

Manning was arrested and incarcerated in the U.S. military justice system and later sentenced to 35 years in confinement.&lt;ref&gt;

During this period, in 2001, he overdosed on prescription amphetamines.&lt;ref name=&quot;mpalm03&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jkahn04&quot;/&gt;

In a 2004 interview with ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', an ex-girlfriend of Lamo's described him as &quot;very controlling,&quot; stating, &quot;He carried a [[electroshock weapon|stun gun]], which he used on me.&quot; According to the same article, a court issued a restraining order against Lamo.&lt;ref name=&quot;jkahn04&quot;&gt;

Lamo claimed in a ''Wired'' article that in May 2010, after reporting his backpack stolen, an investigating officer noted unusual behavior and placed him under a [[5150 (involuntary psychiatric hold)|72-hour involuntary psychiatric hold]], which was extended to a nine day hold.

===Security compromise===
In December 2001, Lamo was praised by [[Worldcom]] for helping to fortify their corporate security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poulsen|first=Kevin|title=FBI reportedly hunting Adrian Lamo|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/09/05/fbi_reportedly_hunting_adrian_lamo/|publisher=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2002 he broke into the internal computer network of ''The New York Times'', adding his name to the internal database of expert sources, and using the paper's [[LexisNexis]] account to conduct research on high-profile subjects. The ''New York Times'' filed a complaint, and a warrant for Lamo's arrest was issued in August 2003 following a 15-month investigation by federal prosecutors in New York. At 10:15 AM on September 9, after spending a few days in hiding, he surrendered to the [[United States Marshals Service|US Marshals]] in [[Sacramento, California]]. He re-surrendered to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] in New York City on September 11, and pled guilty to one felony count of [[computer crime]]s against [[Microsoft]], [[LexisNexis]] and ''[[The New York Times]]'' on January 8, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Noah|last=Shachtman |url=http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/news/2004/01/61831 |title=Adrian Lamo Cuts Deal With Feds |publisher=Wired.com |accessdate=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kevin Poulsen |url=http://www.securityfocus.com/news/7771 |title=Lamo Pleads Guilty to Times Hack |publisher=Securityfocus.com |date=January 8, 2004 |accessdate=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2004, Lamo was sentenced to six months detention at his parents' home plus two years probation, and was ordered to pay roughly $65,000 in restitution. He was convicted of compromising security at ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[Microsoft]],&lt;ref&gt;

When challenged for a response to allegations that he was glamorizing crime for the sake of publicity, his response was &quot;Anything I could say about my person or my actions would only cheapen what they have to say for themselves&quot;. When approached for comment during his criminal case, Lamo frustrated reporters with [[non sequitur (absurdism)|non sequiturs]] such as &quot;Faith manages&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;

===DNA controversy===
On May 9, 2006, while 18 months into a two-year probation sentence, Lamo refused to give the [[United States government]] a blood sample, one that they had demanded in order to record his [[DNA]] in their [[Combined DNA Index System|CODIS]] system.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; According to his attorney, Lamo has a religious objection to giving blood, but is willing to give his DNA in another form. On June 15, 2007, lawyers for Lamo filed a motion citing the [[Book of Genesis]] as one basis for Lamo's religious opposition to the giving of blood.

On June 21, 2007, it was reported that Lamo's legal counsel had reached a settlement agreement with the U.S. [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] granting Lamo's original request. According to [[Kevin Poulsen]]'s blog, &quot;the Justice Department formally settled the case, filing a joint stipulation along with Lamo's federal public defender dropping the demand for blood, and accepting cheek swabs instead.&quot; Reached for comment, Lamo reportedly affirmed to Poulsen his intention to &quot;comply vigorously&quot; with the order.&lt;ref&gt;

===WikiLeaks and Manning===
{{see also|Chelsea Manning}}
In February 2009, a partial list of the anonymous donors to the WikiLeaks not-for-profit website was leaked and published on the WikiLeaks website.  Some media sources indicated at the time that Lamo was among the donors on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytech.com/Wikileaks+Forced+to+Post+Its+Own+Secrets/article14328.htm |title=Wikileaks Forced to Post Its Own Secrets |publisher=DailyTech |accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wikileaked&gt;{{cite web|last=Singel |first=Ryan |url=http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2009-02/18/wikileaks-forced-to-leak-own-secret-info |title=Wikileaks forced to leak its own secret info (Wired UK) |publisher=Wired.co.uk |accessdate=December 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wired'' reported that Lamo commented on his [[Twitter]] page, &quot;Thanks WikiLeaks, for leaking your donor list...

Lamo has stated that he would not have turned Manning in &quot;if lives weren't in danger... [Manning] was in a war zone and basically trying to vacuum up as much classified information as he could, and just throwing it up into the air.&quot;&lt;ref name=wiredIntAnarrest /&gt; WikiLeaks responded by denouncing Lamo and ''Wired Magazine'' reporter [[Kevin Poulsen]] as &quot;notorious felons, informers &amp; manipulators&quot; and said that &quot;journalists should take care.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;

Lamo has been criticized by fellow hackers such as those at the [[Hackers on Planet Earth]] conference in 2010, who called him a &quot;[[Informant|snitch]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;According to [[Eric Corley|Emmanuel Goldstein]], who organized the panel discussion, 90 percent of the conference was anti-Lamo.&quot; [http://www.aolnews.com/nation/article/wikileaks-snitch-hacker-adrian-lamo-faces-wrath-of-his-peers/19562042 'WikiLeaks 'Snitch' Hacker Faces Wrath of His Peers'], ''[[AOL News]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Another commented to Lamo following his speech during a panel discussion saying: &quot;From my perspective, I see what you have done as treason.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/7/27/wikileaks_is_not_one_personwe_are |title=&quot;WikiLeaks Is Not One Person...We Are All the Threat&quot; – Hacker Magazine Editor Says WikiLeaks Is Bigger Than Julian Assange |publisher=Democracynow.org |date=July 27, 2010 |accessdate=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WikiLeaks founder [[Julian Assange]] calls Lamo &quot;a very disreputable character&quot;, and says that Lamo's monetary support for WikiLeaks amounted to only 20 U.S. dollars on one occasion.&lt;ref name=assangewiki&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikileaks.org/WikiSecrets-Julian-Assange-Full.html |title=&quot;WikiSecrets&quot; &amp;#124; full interview footage - See video at 21:25 |publisher=Wikileaks.org |date=May 24, 2011 |accessdate=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assange says that it is &quot;not right to call [Lamo] a contributor to WikiLeaks&quot;, and questions the electronic record associated with the Manning–Lamo chats, because, according to Assange, Lamo has &quot;strange motivations&quot; and &quot;had been in a mental hospital three weeks beforehand&quot;.&lt;ref name=assangewiki /&gt;

Lamo has characterized his decision to work with the government as morally ambiguous but objectively necessary, writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'' &quot;There were no right choices that day, only less wrong ones. It was cold, it was needful, and it was no one's to make except mine,&quot; adding to The Guardian's Ed Pilkington &quot;There were hundreds of thousands of documents – let's drop the number to 250,000 to be conservative – and doing nothing meant gambling that each and every one would do no harm if no warning was given.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Greenwald, Lamo and ''Wired'' magazine====
Lamo's role in the Manning case drew the ire of [[Glenn Greenwald]] of ''[[Salon Magazine]]'', an ardent supporter of WikiLeaks and passionate critic of Lamo. Greenwald suggested that Lamo lied to Manning by turning Manning in, and also lied after the fact to cover up the circumstances of Manning's confessions.&lt;ref name=gg&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Greenwald places the incident in the context of what he calls &quot;the Obama administration's unprecedented war on whistle-blowers&quot;.&lt;ref name=gg /&gt; Greenwald's critique of ''Wired Magazine'' has drawn a response from that magazine which suggests that Greenwald is writing disingenuously:  &quot;At his most reasonable, Greenwald impugns our motives, attacks the character of our staff and carefully selects his facts and sources to misrepresent the truth and generate outrage in his readership.&quot;&lt;ref name=wiredgg&gt;{{cite web|last=Hansen |first=Evan |url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/12/greenwald/ |title=Putting the Record Straight on the Lamo–Manning Chat Logs &amp;#124; Threat Level |publisher=Wired.com |date=December 31, 2010 |accessdate=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article about the Manning case, Greenwald mentions ''Wired'' reporter [[Kevin Poulsen]]'s 1994 felony conviction for computer hacking, suggesting that &quot;over the years, Poulsen has served more or less as Lamo's personal media voice.&quot;&lt;ref name=gg /&gt; Greenwald is skeptical of an earlier story written by Poulsen about Lamo's institutionalization on psychiatric grounds, writing:  &quot;Lamo claimed he was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, a somewhat fashionable autism diagnosis which many stars in the computer world have also claimed.&quot;&lt;ref name=gg /&gt; In his response, Poulsen accused Greenwald of &quot;name-calling, bizarre conspiracy theories and [[ad hominem]] attacks&quot;.&lt;ref name=wiredgg /&gt;

Greenwald called for ''Wired'' to release more of the chat logs in its possession that pertain to a conversation between Manning and Lamo:  &quot;there are clearly relevant parts of those chats which ''Wired'' continues to conceal&quot;.&lt;ref name=gg /&gt; ''Wired''{{'}}s editor-in-chief reiterated that &quot;the logs include sensitive personal information with no bearing on WikiLeaks, and it would serve no purpose to publish them at this time.&quot;&lt;ref name=wiredgg /&gt; In an article entitled &quot;The Worsening Journalistic Disgrace at Wired&quot;, Greenwald claimed that ''Wired'' was &quot;actively conceal[ing] from the public, for months on end, the key evidence in a political story that has generated headlines around the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |url=http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/12/27/wired |title=The worsening journalistic disgrace at Wired |publisher=Salon.com |date=December 27, 2010 |accessdate=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 13, 2011, ''Wired'' published the logs in full, stating that &quot;The most significant of the unpublished details have now been publicly established with sufficient authority that we no longer believe any purpose is served by withholding the logs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Manning–Lamo Chat Logs Revealed |first=Evan |last=Hansen |url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/07/manning-lamo-logs/ |newspaper=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=July 13, 2011 |accessdate=July 14, 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/60AvdoIoF |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenwald wrote of the newly released logs that in his opinion they validated his claim that ''Wired'' had concealed important evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wired publishes the full Manning–Lamo chat logs |first=Glenn |last=Greenwald |url=http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2011/07/14/wired/index.html |newspaper=Salon.com |date=July 14, 2011 |accessdate=July 14, 2011 |deadurl=no| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110715211508/http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2011/07/14/wired/index.html| archivedate= July 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism of Media Coverage of Anonymous====
Lamo has been critical of media coverage of the hacker collective [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]], claiming that media outlets have over-hyped and mythologised the group. He also said that Anonymous is not the 'invulnerable' group it is claimed to be, and can see &quot;no rational point in what they're doing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/articles/344388/20120523/adrian-lamo-snitch-anonymous-bradley-manning-wikileaks.htm|title=EXCLUSIVE: Hacker Adrian Lamo Who Betrayed Wikileaks' Manning Turns Fire on Anonymous|author=Gianluca Mezzofiore|date=May 23, 2012|publisher=International Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and television==
On August 22, 2002, Lamo was removed from a segment of [[NBC Nightly News]] when, after being asked to demonstrate his skills for the camera, he gained access to NBC's internal network.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; NBC was concerned that they broke the law by taping Lamo while he (possibly) broke the law.  Lamo was a guest on [[The Screen Savers]] five times beginning in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;

''[[Hackers Wanted]]'', a documentary film focusing on Lamo's life as a hacker, was produced by [[Trigger Street Productions]], and narrated by [[Kevin Spacey]].&lt;ref name=film&gt;{{cite web|last=Poulsen |first=Kevin |url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/05/hackers-wante/ |title=Lost Hacking Documentary Surfaces on Pirate Bay &amp;#124; Threat Level |publisher=Wired.com |date=May 21, 2010 |accessdate=August 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focusing on the 2003 hacking scene, the film features interviews with [[Kevin Rose]] and [[Steve Wozniak]].&lt;ref name=film /&gt; The film has not been conventionally released. In May 2009, a video purporting to be a trailer for ''Hackers Wanted'' was allegedly leaked to or by Internet film site Eye Crave.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, an earlier cut of the film was leaked on [[BitTorrent (protocol)|Bittorrent]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; According to an insider, what was leaked on the Internet was a very different film from the newer version, which includes additional footage. On June 12, 2010, a director's cut version of the film was also leaked onto torrent sites.&lt;ref&gt;
