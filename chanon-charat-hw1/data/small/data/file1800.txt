In [[analytic geometry]], an '''asymptote''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|s|ɪ|m|p|t|oʊ|t}}) of a [[curve]] is a line such that the distance between the curve and the line approaches zero as they tend to infinity. Some sources include the requirement that the curve may not cross the line infinitely often, but this is unusual for modern authors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rowdy.msudenver.edu/~talmanl/PDFs/APCalculus/OnAsymptotes.pdf &quot;Asymptotes&quot; by Louis A. Talman]&lt;/ref&gt; In some contexts, such as [[algebraic geometry]], an asymptote is defined as a line which is [[tangent]] to a curve at infinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=An elementary treatise on the differential calculus|chapter=Asymptotes|first=Benjamin|last=Williamson|url=http://books.google.com/?id=znsXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=241|year=1899}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Jeffrey|last=Nunemacher|title=Asymptotes, Cubic Curves, and the Projective Plane|journal=Mathematics Magazine|volume=72|issue=3|year=1999|pages=183–192|jstor=2690881|doi=10.2307/2690881}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word asymptote is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀσύμπτωτος (''asumptōtos'') which means &quot;not falling together&quot;, from ἀ [[Privative alpha|priv.]] + σύν &quot;together&quot; + πτωτ-ός &quot;fallen&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'', second edition, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was introduced by [[Apollonius of Perga]] in his work on [[conic sections]], but in contrast to its modern meaning, he used it to mean any line that does not intersect the given curve.&lt;ref&gt;D.E. Smith, ''History of Mathematics, vol 2'' Dover (1958) p. 318&lt;/ref&gt;

There are potentially three kinds of asymptotes: ''horizontal'', ''vertical'' and ''oblique'' asymptotes. For curves given by the graph of a function {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''&amp;fnof;''(''x'')}}, horizontal asymptotes are horizontal lines that the graph of the function approaches as ''x'' tends to {{nowrap|+&amp;infin; or &amp;minus;&amp;infin;.}}  Vertical asymptotes are vertical lines near which the function grows without bound.

More generally, one curve is a ''curvilinear asymptote'' of another (as opposed to a ''linear asymptote'') if the distance between the two curves tends to zero as they tend to infinity, although the term ''asymptote'' by itself is usually reserved for linear asymptotes.

Asymptotes convey information about the behavior of curves ''in the large'', and determining the asymptotes of a function is an important step in sketching its graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Apostol | first1=Tom M. | author1-link=Tom M.

==Introduction==
[[File:Hyperbola one over x.svg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\tfrac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; graphed on [[Cartesian coordinates]]. The ''x'' and ''y''-axes are the asymptotes.]]
The idea that a curve may come arbitrarily close to a line without actually becoming the same may seem to counter everyday experience. The representations of a line and a curve as marks on a piece of paper or as pixels on a computer screen have a positive width. So if they were to be extended far enough they would seem to merge, at least as far as the eye could discern. But these are physical representations of the corresponding mathematical entities; the line and the curve are idealized concepts whose width is 0 (see [[Line (geometry)|Line]]). Therefore the understanding of the idea of an asymptote requires an effort of reason rather than experience.

Consider the graph of the function &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; shown to the right. The coordinates of the points on the curve are of the form &lt;math&gt;(x, \frac{1}{x})&lt;/math&gt; where x is a number other than 0. For example, the graph contains the points (1, 1), (2, 0.5), (5, 0.2), (10, 0.1), ... As the values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; become larger and larger, say 100, 1000, 10,000 ..., putting them far to the right of the illustration, the corresponding values of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, .01, .001, .0001, ..., become infinitesimal relative to the scale shown. But no matter how large &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; becomes, its reciprocal ( &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt; ) is never 0, so the curve never actually touches the ''x''-axis. Similarly, as the values of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; become smaller and smaller, say .01, .001, .0001, ..., making them infinitesimal relative to the scale shown, the corresponding values of &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, 100, 1000, 10,000 ..., become larger and larger. So the curve extends farther and farther upward as it comes closer and closer to the ''y''-axis. Thus, both the ''x'' and ''y''-axes are asymptotes of the curve. These ideas are part of the basis of concept of a [[Limit of a function|limit]] in mathematics, and this connection is explained more fully below.&lt;ref&gt;Reference for section: [http://books.google.com/books?id=HTwi2M37rQAC&amp;pg=PA541 &quot;Asymptote&quot;] ''[[Penny Cyclopædia|The Penny Cyclopædia]]'' vol. 2, The Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge (1841) Charles Knight and Co., London p. 541&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asymptotes of functions==
The asymptotes most commonly encountered in the study of [[calculus]] are of curves of the form {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''&amp;fnof;''(''x'')}}. These can be computed using [[limit (mathematics)|limits]] and classified into ''horizontal'', ''vertical'' and ''oblique'' asymptotes depending on its orientation. Horizontal asymptotes are horizontal lines that the graph of the function approaches as ''x'' tends to +∞ or &amp;minus;∞. As the name indicate they are parallel to the ''x''-axis. Vertical asymptotes are vertical lines (perpendicular to the ''x''-axis) near which the function grows without bound. Oblique asymptotes are diagonal lines so that the difference between the curve and the line approaches 0 as ''x'' tends to +∞ or &amp;minus;∞. More general type of asymptotes can be defined in this case. Only  open  curves  that  have  some  infinite  branch, can  have  an asymptote. No  closed  curve  can  have  an  asymptote.

===Vertical asymptotes===
The line ''x'' = ''a'' is a ''vertical asymptote'' of the graph of the function {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''&amp;fnof;''(''x'')}} &lt;!-- Some confusion as to notation, commenting out for now
if : &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a} f(x)=\infty,&lt;/math&gt; or more generally, --&gt; if at least one of the following statements is true:

# &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a^{-}} f(x)=\pm\infty&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a^{+}} f(x)=\pm\infty.&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;!-- 
For example, if ƒ(''x'') = ''x''/(''x''-1), the numerator approaches 1 and the denominator approaches 0 as ''x'' approaches 1. So 
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 1}\frac{x}{x-1}=\infty&lt;/math&gt;
and the curve has a vertical asymptote of ''x''=1. --&gt;

The function ''ƒ''(''x'') may or may not be defined at ''a'', and its precise value at the point ''x'' = ''a'' does not affect the asymptote.  For example, for the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \begin{cases} \frac{1}{x} &amp; \mbox{if } x &gt; 0, \\ 5 &amp; \mbox{if  } x \le 0. \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

has a limit of +∞ as {{nowrap|''x'' &amp;rarr; 0&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;}}, ''ƒ''(''x'') has the vertical asymptote  {{nowrap|1=''x'' = 0}}, even though ''ƒ''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5. The graph of this function does intersect the vertical asymptote once, at (0,5). It is impossible for the graph of a function to intersect a vertical asymptote (or [[vertical line test|a vertical line in general]]) in more than one point. Moreover, if a function is [[continuous function|continuous]] at each point where it is defined, it is impossible that its graph does intersect any vertical asymptote.

A common example of a vertical asymptote is the case of a rational function at a point x such that the denominator is zero and the numerator is non-zero.

===Horizontal asymptotes===
[[File:Asymptote03.png|right|frame|The graph of a function can have two horizontal asymptotes. An example of such a function would be &lt;math&gt;y=\arctan(x).&lt;/math&gt;]]

''Horizontal asymptotes'' are horizontal lines that the graph of the function approaches as {{nowrap|''x'' &amp;rarr; ±&amp;infin;}}.  The horizontal line ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'' is a horizontal asymptote of the function ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ƒ''(''x'') if
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\rightarrow -\infty}f(x)=c&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\rightarrow +\infty}f(x)=c&lt;/math&gt;.
In the first case, ''ƒ''(''x'') has ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'' as asymptote when ''x'' tends to &amp;minus;∞, and in the second that ''ƒ''(''x'') has ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'' as an asymptote as ''x'' tends to +∞

For example the arctangent function satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\rightarrow -\infty}\arctan(x)=-\frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}\arctan(x)=\frac{\pi}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;

So the line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = &amp;minus;&amp;pi;/2}} is a horizontal tangent for the arctangent when ''x'' tends to &amp;minus;∞, and {{nowrap|1=''y'' = &amp;pi;/2}} is a horizontal tangent for the arctangent when ''x'' tends to +∞.

Functions may lack horizontal asymptotes on either or both sides, or may have one horizontal asymptote that is the same in both directions. For example, the function {{nowrap|1=ƒ(''x'') = 1/(''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+1)}} has a horizontal asymptote at ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 when ''x'' tends both to &amp;minus;∞ and +∞ because, respectively,

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to -\infty}\frac{1}{x^2+1}=\lim_{x\to +\infty}\frac{1}{x^2+1}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Oblique asymptotes===
[[File:1-over-x-plus-x.svg|right|thumb|220px|In the graph of &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x+\tfrac{1}{x}&lt;/math&gt;, the ''y''-axis (''x'' = 0) and the line ''y'' = ''x'' are both asymptotes.]]
When a linear asymptote is not parallel to the ''x''- or ''y''-axis, it is called an ''oblique asymptote'' or ''slant asymptote''. A function ''f''(''x'') is asymptotic to the straight line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''n''}} (''m''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;0) if

&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to +\infty}\left[ f(x)-(mx+n)\right] = 0 \, \mbox{ or } \lim_{x \to -\infty}\left[ f(x)-(mx+n)\right] = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

In the first case the line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''n''}} is an oblique asymptote of ''ƒ''(''x'') when ''x'' tends to +∞, and in the second case the line {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''n''}} is an oblique asymptote of ''ƒ(x)'' when ''x'' tends to &amp;minus;∞

An example is ƒ(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x'' + 1/''x'', which has the oblique asymptote ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x'' (that is ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0) as seen in the limits
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\left[f(x)-x\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\left[\left(x+\frac{1}{x}\right)-x\right]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;=\lim_{x\to\pm\infty}\frac{1}{x}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

== Elementary methods for identifying asymptotes ==
The asymptotes of many elementary functions can be found without the explicit use of limits (although the derivations of such methods typically use limits).

===General computation of oblique asymptotes for functions===

The oblique asymptote, for the function ''f''(''x''), will be given by the equation ''y''=''mx''+''n''. The value for ''m'' is computed first and is given by

:&lt;math&gt;m\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\lim_{x\rightarrow a}f(x)/x&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' is either &lt;math&gt;-\infty&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt; depending on the case being studied. It is good practice to treat the two cases separately. If this limit doesn't exist then there is no oblique asymptote in that direction.

Having ''m'' then the value for ''n'' can be computed by

:&lt;math&gt;n\stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\lim_{x\rightarrow a}(f(x)-mx)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' should be the same value used before. If this limit fails to exist then there is no oblique asymptote in that direction, even should the limit defining ''m'' exist. Otherwise {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''n''}} is the oblique asymptote of ''ƒ''(''x'') as ''x'' tends to ''a''.

For example, the function {{nowrap|1=''&amp;fnof;''(''x'') = (2''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 3''x'' + 1)/''x''}} has

:&lt;math&gt;m=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}f(x)/x=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}\frac{2x^2+3x+1}{x^2}=2&lt;/math&gt; and then
:&lt;math&gt;n=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}(f(x)-mx)=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}\left(\frac{2x^2+3x+1}{x}-2x\right)=3&lt;/math&gt;

so that {{nowrap|1=''y'' = 2''x'' + 3}} is the asymptote of ''ƒ''(''x'') when ''x'' tends to +∞.

The function {{nowrap|1=''&amp;fnof;''(''x'') = ln ''x''}} has

:&lt;math&gt;m=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}f(x)/x=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}\frac{\ln x}{x}=0&lt;/math&gt; and then

:&lt;math&gt;n=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}(f(x)-mx)=\lim_{x\rightarrow+\infty}\ln x&lt;/math&gt;, which does not exist.

So {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ln ''x''}} does not have an asymptote when ''x'' tends to +∞.

=== Asymptotes for rational functions ===
A [[rational function]] has at most one horizontal asymptote or oblique (slant) asymptote, and possibly many vertical asymptotes.

The [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] of the numerator and degree of the denominator determine whether or not there are any horizontal or oblique asymptotes. The cases are tabulated below, where deg(numerator) is the degree of the numerator, and deg(denominator) is the degree of the denominator.

| &gt; 1

|}

The vertical asymptotes occur only when the denominator is zero (If both the numerator and denominator are zero, the multiplicities of the zero are compared). For example, the following function has vertical asymptotes at ''x'' = 0, and ''x'' = 1, but not at ''x'' = 2.
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{x^2-5x+6}{x^3-3x^2+2x}=\frac{(x-2)(x-3)}{x(x-1)(x-2)}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Oblique asymptotes of rational functions ====
[[File:SlantAsymptoteError.svg|right|thumb|320px|Black: the graph of &lt;math&gt;f(x)=(x^2+x+1)/(x+1)&lt;/math&gt;. Red: the asymptote &lt;math&gt;y=x&lt;/math&gt;. Green: difference between the graph and its asymptote for &lt;math&gt;x=1,2,3,4,5,6&lt;/math&gt;]]

When the numerator of a rational function has degree exactly one greater than the denominator, the function has an oblique (slant) asymptote. The asymptote is the polynomial term after [[Polynomial long division|dividing]] the numerator and denominator. This phenomenon occurs because when dividing the fraction, there will be a linear term, and a remainder. For example, consider the function 
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{x^2+x+1}{x+1}=x+\frac{1}{x+1}&lt;/math&gt;
shown to the right. As the value of ''x'' increases, ''f'' approaches the asymptote ''y'' = ''x''. This is because the other term, ''y'' = 1/(''x''+1) becomes smaller.

If the degree of the numerator is more than 1 larger than the degree of the denominator, and the denominator does not divide the numerator, there will be a nonzero remainder that goes to zero as ''x'' increases, but the quotient will not be linear, and the function does not have an oblique asymptote.

=== Transformations of known functions ===
If a known function has an asymptote (such as ''y''=0 for ''f''(x)=''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;), then the translations of it also have an asymptote.
* If ''x''=''a'' is a vertical asymptote of ''f''(''x''), then ''x''=''a''+''h'' is a vertical asymptote of ''f''(''x''-''h'')
* If ''y''=''c'' is a horizontal asymptote of ''f''(''x''), then ''y''=''c''+''k'' is a horizontal asymptote of ''f''(''x'')+''k''

If a known function has an asymptote, then the [[Homothetic transformation|scaling]] of the function also have an asymptote.

* If ''y''=''ax''+''b'' is an asymptote of ''f''(''x''), then ''y''=''cax''+''cb'' is an asymptote of ''cf''(''x'')
For example, ''f''(''x'')=''e''&lt;sup&gt;''x''-1&lt;/sup&gt;+2 has horizontal asymptote ''y''=0+2=2, and no vertical or oblique asymptotes.

== General definition ==

Let {{nowrap|''A'' : (''a'',''b'') &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} be a [[parametric curve|parametric]] plane curve, in coordinates ''A''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''(''t''),''y''(''t'')).  Suppose that the curve tends to infinity, that is: 
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{t\rightarrow b}(x^2(t)+y^2(t))=\infty.&lt;/math&gt;
A line ℓ is an asymptote of ''A'' if the distance from the point ''A''(''t'') to ℓ tends to zero as ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''b''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Pogorelov | first1=A. V. | title=Differential geometry | publisher=P. Noordhoff N. V. | location=Groningen | series=Translated from the first Russian ed. by L. F. Boron | mr=0114163 | year=1959}}, §8.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the upper right branch of the curve ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''x'' can be defined parametrically as ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''t'', ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''t'' (where ''t''&gt;0). First, ''x''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞ as ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞ and the distance from the curve to the ''x''-axis is 1/''t'' which approaches 0 as ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞. Therefore the ''x''-axis is an asymptote of the curve. Also, ''y''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;∞ as ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0 from the right, and the distance between the curve and the ''y''-axis is ''t'' which approaches 0 as ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;0. So the ''y''-axis is also an asymptote. A similar argument shows that the lower left branch of the curve also has the same two lines as asymptotes.

Although the definition here uses a parameterization of the curve, the notion of asymptote does not depend on the parameterization. In fact, if the equation of the line is &lt;math&gt;ax+by+c=0&lt;/math&gt; then the distance from the point ''A''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''(''t''),''y''(''t'')) to the line is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{|ax(t)+by(t)+c|}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
if γ(''t'') is a change of parameterization then the distance becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{|ax(\gamma(t))+by(\gamma(t))+c|}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
which tends to zero simultaneously as the previous expression.

An important case is when the curve is the [[Graph of a function|graph]] of a [[real function]] (a function of one real variable and returning real values). The graph of the function ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ƒ''(''x'') is the set of points of the plane with coordinates (''x'',''ƒ''(''x'')). For this, a parameterization is
:&lt;math&gt;t\mapsto (t,f(t)).&lt;/math&gt;
This parameterization is to be considered over the open intervals (''a'',''b''), where ''a'' can be &amp;minus;∞ and ''b'' can be +∞.

An asymptote can be either vertical or non-vertical (oblique or horizontal). In the first case its equation is ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'', for some real number ''c''. The non-vertical case has equation {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''mx'' + ''n''}}, where ''m'' and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are real numbers. All three types of asymptotes can be present at the same time in specific examples.  Unlike asymptotes for curves that are graphs of functions, a general curve may have more than two non-vertical asymptotes, and may cross its vertical asymptotes more than once.

Let {{nowrap|''A'' : (''a'',''b'') &amp;rarr; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} be a parametric plane curve, in coordinates ''A''(''t'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''x''(''t''),''y''(''t'')), and ''B'' be another (unparameterized) curve. Suppose, as before, that the curve ''A'' tends to infinity. The curve ''B'' is a curvilinear asymptote of ''A'' if the shortest of the distance from the point ''A''(''t'') to a point on ''B'' tends to zero as ''t''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''b''.  Sometimes ''B'' is simply referred to as an asymptote of ''A'', when there is no risk of confusion with linear asymptotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Fowler|first=R.

For example, the function
:&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{x^3+2x^2+3x+4}{x}&lt;/math&gt;
has a curvilinear asymptote {{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2''x'' + 3}}, which is known as a ''parabolic asymptote'' because it is a [[parabola]] rather than a straight line.&lt;ref&gt;William Nicholson, ''The British enciclopaedia, or dictionary of arts and sciences; comprising an accurate and popular view of the present improved state of human knowledge'', Vol. 5, 1809&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asymptotes and curve sketching==
The notion of asymptote is related to procedures of [[curve sketching]]. An asymptote serves as a guide line that serves to show the behavior of the curve towards infinity.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, P. ''An elementary treatise on curve tracing'' (1918) [http://www.archive.org/details/elementarytreati00fros online]&lt;/ref&gt; In order to get better approximations of the curve, asymptotes that are general curves have also been used &lt;ref&gt;Fowler, R. H. ''The elementary differential geometry of plane curves'' Cambridge, University Press, 1920, pp 89ff.([http://www.archive.org/details/elementarydiffer00fowlrich online at archive.org])&lt;/ref&gt; although the term asymptotic curve seems to be preferred.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, P. ''An elementary treatise on curve tracing'', 1918, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

A plane curve of degree ''n'' intersects its asymptote at most at ''n''&amp;minus;2 other points, by [[Bézout's theorem]], as the intersection at infinity is of multiplicity at least two.  For a [[conic]], there are a pair of lines that do not intersect the conic at any complex point: these are the two asymptotes of the conic.

A plane algebraic curve is defined by an equation of the form ''P''(''x'',''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 where ''P'' is a polynomial of degree ''n''
:&lt;math&gt;P(x,y) = P_n(x,y) + P_{n-1}(x,y) + \cdots + P_1(x,y) + P_0&lt;/math&gt;
where ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is [[homogeneous polynomial|homogeneous]] of degree ''k''.  Vanishing of the linear factors of the highest degree term ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; defines the asymptotes of the curve: setting {{math|1=''Q'' = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, if {{math|1=''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'', ''y'') = (''ax'' &amp;minus; ''by'') ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'', ''y'')}}, then the line
:&lt;math&gt;Q'_x(b,a)x+Q'_y(b,a)y + P_{n-1}(b,a)=0&lt;/math&gt;
is an asymptote if &lt;math&gt;Q'_x(b,a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q'_y(b,a)&lt;/math&gt; are not both zero. If  &lt;math&gt;Q'_x(b,a)=Q'_y(b,a)=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_{n-1}(b,a)\neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, there is no asymptote, but the curve has a branch that looks like a branch of parabola. Such a branch is said a '''parabolic branch''', even when it does not has any parabola that is a curvilinear asymptote. If &lt;math&gt;Q'_x(b,a)=Q'_y(b,a)=P_{n-1}(b,a)=0,&lt;/math&gt; the curve has a singular point at infinity which may have several asymptotes or parabolic branches.

Over the complex numbers, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; splits into linear factors, each of which defines an asymptote (or several for multiple factors).  0ver the reals, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; splits in factors that are linear or quadratic factors. Only the linear factors correspond to infinite (real) branches of the curve, but if a linear factor has multiplicity greater than one, the curve may have several asymptotes or parabolic branches. It may also occur that such a multiple linear factor corresponds to two complex conjugate branches, and does not corresponds to any infinite branch of the real curve.  For example, the curve {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 1 = 0}} has no real points outside the square &lt;math&gt; |x|\leq 1, |y|\leq 1&lt;/math&gt;, but its highest order term gives the linear factor ''x'' with multiplicity 4, leading to the unique asymptote ''x''=0.

==Asymptotic cone==

[[File:Conic section hyperbola.gif|thumb|Hyperbolas, obtained cutting the same right circular cone with a plane and their asymptotes.]]
The hyperbola
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}= 1&lt;/math&gt;
has the two asymptotes 
:&lt;math&gt;y=\pm\frac{b}{a}x.&lt;/math&gt;
The equation for the union of these two lines is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}=0.&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, the [[hyperboloid]]
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}-\frac{z^2}{c^2}=1&lt;/math&gt;
is said to have the '''asymptotic cone'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=YMU0AAAAMAAJ L.P. Siceloff, G. Wentworth, D.E. Smith ''Analytic geometry'' (1922) p. 271]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=fGg4AAAAMAAJ P. Frost ''Solid geometry'' (1875)] This has a more general treatment of asymptotic surfaces.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}-\frac{z^2}{c^2}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The distance between the hyperboloid and cone approaches 0 as the distance from the origin approaches infinity.

More generally, let us consider a surface that has an implicit equation 
&lt;math&gt;P_d(x,y,z)+P_{d-2}(x,y,z) + \cdots P_0=0,&lt;/math&gt;
where the &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; are [[homogeneous polynomial]]s of degree &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_{d-1}=0&lt;/math&gt;. Then the equation &lt;math&gt;P_d(x,y,z)=0&lt;/math&gt; defines a [[cone]] which is centered at the origin. It is called '''asymptotic cone''', because the distance to the cone of a point of the surface tends to zero when the point on the surface tends to infinity.
