==History==

===Founding===
[[File:Amway Japan Head Office.jpg|thumb|upright|Amway Japan Head Office]]
[[File:Honda- Amway アムウェイベトナム（AVCL）Hồ Chí Minh PB277728.jpg|thumb|upright|Amway Vietnam (Hồ Chí Minh since 2008)]]

Jay Van Andel and Rich DeVos, friends since school days, had been business partners in various endeavors including a hamburger stand, air charter service, and a sailing business. In 1949 they were introduced by Neil Maaskant (Van Andel's second cousin) to the ''Nutrilite Products'' Corporation. [[Nutrilite]] was a California-based direct sales company founded by Dr. [[Carl Rehnborg]], developer of the first [[multivitamin]] marketed in the United States. In August 1949, after a night-long talk, DeVos and Van Andel signed up to become distributors for Nutrilite food supplements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conn&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last= Conn|first= Charles Paul|title= The Possible Dream: A Candid Look At Amway|authorlink=Charles Paul Conn|publisher=[[Revell]] |year= 1977 |isbn= 0-8007-0857-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} They sold their first box the next day for $19.50, but lost interest for the next two weeks. Shortly thereafter, at the urging of Maaskant, who had become their sponsor, they traveled to Chicago to attend a Nutrilite seminar. The meeting was at a downtown hotel, with over a hundred people in attendance. After seeing promotional filmstrips and listening to talks by company representatives and successful distributors, they decided to pursue the Nutrilite business opportunity with enthusiasm. They sold their second box of supplements on their return trip to Michigan, and rapidly proceeded to develop their new business further.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conn&quot; /&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}

In 1949, DeVos and Van Andel had formed '''Ja-Ri Corporation''' (abbreviated from their respective first names) for importing wooden goods from South American countries. After their trip to the Nutrilite seminar, they dropped{{Clarify|date=March 2009}}&lt;!---Sold?---&gt; this business and Ja-Ri became their Nutrilite distributorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Van Andel|first= Jay|title= An Enterprising Life|authorlink=Jay Van Andel|publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |year= 1998 |isbn= 0-88730-997-6|pages=37–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to profits on each product sold, Nutrilite also offered commission on the sales of products by new distributors introduced to the company by existing distributors—a system today known as [[multi-level marketing]] or [[network marketing]]. By 1958, DeVos and Van Andel had built an organization of over 5,000 distributors. However, following concerns about the stability of Nutrilite, in April 1959 they and some of their top distributors formed ''The American Way Association'' to represent the distributors and look for additional products to market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Robinson|first= James W.|title= Empire of Freedom: The Amway Story and What It Means to You|publisher=[[Prima Publishing]] |year= 1997 |isbn= 0-7615-1088-5|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Their first product was called ''Frisk'', a concentrated organic cleaner developed by a scientist in Ohio. DeVos and Van Andel bought the rights to manufacture and distribute Frisk, and later changed the name to LOC (Liquid Organic Cleaner).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

===International expansion===
Amway expanded overseas to Australia in 1971, to Europe in 1973, to parts of Asia in 1974, to Japan in 1979, to Latin America in 1985, to Thailand in 1987, to China in 1995, to Africa in 1997, to India and Scandinavia in 1998, to Ukraine in 2003, to Russia in 2005, and to Vietnam in 2008.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===Quixtar===
{{Main|Amway Global}}
In 1999 the founders of the Amway corporation established a new holding company, named [[Alticor]], and launched three new companies: a sister (and separate) Internet-focused company named [[Quixtar]], [[Access Business Group]], and Pyxis Innovations. Pyxis, later replaced by [[Fulton Innovation]], pursued research and development and [[Access Business Group]] handled manufacturing and logistics for Amway, Quixtar, and third party clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2007706130458 |title=Amway marque to be revived; Quixtar label scrapped |publisher=The Detroit News |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main difference was that all &quot;Independent Business Owners&quot; (IBO) could order directly from Amway on the Internet, rather than from their [[upline]] &quot;direct distributor,&quot; and have products shipped directly to their home. The Amway name continued being used in the rest of the world. After virtually all Amway distributors in North America switched to Quixtar, Alticor elected to close Amway North America after 2001. In June 2007 it was announced that the Quixtar brand would be phased out over an 18 to 24 month period in favor of a unified Amway brand ([[Amway Global]]) worldwide.

In 2006, Quixtar published ''The Quixtar Independent Business Owner Compensation Plan'', in which the company reported that the average monthly gross income for &quot;Active&quot; IBOs was $115.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quixtar.com/documents/iwov/vis/010-en/pdf/IBO%20Support/BusForms/SA4400.pdf |title=Quixtar.com |format=PDF |accessdate=July 9, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110715140756/http://www.quixtar.com/documents/iwov/vis/010-en/pdf/IBO%20Support/BusForms/SA4400.pdf| archivedate= July 15, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global markets==
According to the Amway website, {{as of|2011|lc=y}} the company operates in over 100 countries and territories, organized into regional markets: the Americas, Europe, greater China, Japan and Korea, and SE Asia/Australia.

In 2008, Alticor announced that two-thirds of the company's 58 markets reported sales increases, including strong growth in the China, Russia, Ukraine and India markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS173002+05-Feb-2009+PRN20090205 |title=Amway Parent hits 50th year running recording 15% sales growth |agency=Reuters  |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |date=February 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amway China===
Amway grew quickly in China from its market launch in 1995. In 1998, after abuses of illegal [[pyramid scheme]]s led to riots, the Chinese government enacted a ban on all [[direct selling]] companies, including Amway.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chinese officials ban direct marketing&quot;, April 22, 1998 ''[[Associated Press]]'', The Associated Press&lt;/ref&gt; After the negotiations, some companies like Amway, [[Avon Products, Inc.|Avon]], and [[Mary Kay]] continued to operate through a network of retail stores promoted by an independent sales force.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Once-barred Amway becomes booming business in China&quot;, Leslie Chang, March 12, 2003,  ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;/ref&gt; China introduced new direct selling laws in December 2005, and in December 2006 Amway was one of the first companies to receive a license to resume direct sales. However, the law forbids teachers, doctors, and civil servants from becoming direct sales agents for the company and, unlike in the U.S., salespeople in China are ineligible to receive commissions from sales made by the distributors they recruit.

In 2006, Amway China had a reported 180,000 sales representatives, 140 stores, and $2&amp;nbsp;billion in annual sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mlive.com/business/kzgazette/index.ssf?/base/business-3/116693763565130.xml&amp;coll=7 &quot;Amway, Mary Kay get long-awaited direct-selling licenses in China&quot;] Rob Kirkbride, December 24, 2006, ''[[Kalamazoo Gazette]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Amway Greater China and South-east Asia Chief Executive Eva Cheng was ranked No.88 by Forbes magazine in its list of the World's Most Powerful Women.&lt;ref name=&quot;ForbesWomen&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/11/biz_powerwomen08_Eva-Cheng_34MT.html |title=Forbes' The 100 Most Powerful Women; No.88 Eva Cheng |work=Forbes |accessdate=July 9, 2011 |date=August 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, China was Amway's largest market, reporting 28% growth and sales of ¥17&amp;nbsp;billion (US$2.5 billion).&lt;ref name=LevinD&gt;{{cite news|last=Levin|first=Dan|title=Amway's China Redux|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:msGs9qx1urAJ:www.forbes.com/global/2009/0907/companies-sales-amway-china-redux.html+2008+Amway+China+28%25+growth&amp;cd=15&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;source=www.google.com|accessdate=May 17, 2011|newspaper=[[Forbes]]|date=August 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report in Bloomberg Businessweek in April 2010, Amway had 237 retail shops in China, 160,000 direct sales agents, and US$3&amp;nbsp;billion in revenue.&lt;ref name=EinhornB&gt;{{cite news|last=Einhorn|first=Bruce|title=Why Amway and China are a Good Fit|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_16/b4174064710167.htm|accessdate=June 16, 2011|newspaper=[[Businessweek]]|date=April 8, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110606102312/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_16/b4174064710167.htm| archivedate= June 6, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amway China holds large incentive trips each year as rewards for its top achievers to different destinations. As the trips involve thousands of participants, events often result in a boost for the local economy of the destination.

==Brands==
Amway's product line grew from LOC, with the laundry detergent [[SA8 (detergent)|SA8]] added in 1960, and later the hair care product Satinique (1965) and the cosmetics line [[Artistry (cosmetics)|Artistry]] (1968). Today Amway manufactures over 450 products, with manufacturing facilities in China, India and the United States, as well as Nutrilite organic farms in [[Brazil]], Mexico and the United States (California and [[Washington (state)|Washington State]]). Amway brands include: [[Artistry]], Atmosphere, [[Body Blends]], Body Works, Clear Now, eSpring, [[Fulton Street]], [[Glister (brand)|Glister]], iCook, Kahve, [[Legacy of Clean]], [[Nutrilite]], Peter Island, Perfect Empowered Drinking Water, Personal Accents, Ribbon, [[Satinique]], [[Tolsom]], [[XS Energy Drink|XS]], and Zsenso.

===Household cleaners===
Amway is best known in North America for its original multi-purpose cleaning product LOC, [[SA8 (detergent)|SA8]] laundry detergent, and Dish Drops dishwashing liquid. In the January 2007 issue of ''[[Consumer Reports]]'', SA8 with Bioquest was rated the best-performing laundry detergent, scoring 99 out of a possible 100 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/home-garden/cooking-cleaning/laundry-detergents-1-07/overview/0107_soap_ov.htm |title=Laundry Detergents |publisher=Consumer Reports |date=July 1, 2011 |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer Reports did, however, criticize SA8's pricing, a situation which was disputed by Amway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Rob Kirkbride / The Grand Rapids Press|title=Amway's old reliable cleans up|publisher=Grand Rapids Press, The (MI)|page=A1 |date= December 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer Reports conducted blind testing of detergents in 2010 and ranked versions of Amway's Legacy of Clean detergents 9th and 18th of 20 detergents tested. Consumer Reports program manager Pat Slaven recommended against buying the products because consumers can &quot;go to the grocery store and get something that performs a whole lot better for a whole lot less money.&quot;&lt;ref name=Odonnell2011&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Donnell|first= Jayne|title=Multilevel marketing or 'pyramid?'

==Business model==
Amway combines direct selling with a multi-level marketing strategy. &quot;Independent Business Owners&quot; (IBOs) may market products directly to potential customers and may also sponsor and mentor other people to become IBOs. IBOs may earn income both from the retail markup on any products they sell personally, plus a performance bonus based on the sales volume they and their downline (IBOs they have sponsored) have generated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Xardel&quot;/&gt; People may also register as IBOs to buy products at discounted prices.

==Politics and culture==

===Political causes===
In the 1990s, the Amway organization was a major contributor to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] (GOP) and to the election campaigns of various GOP candidates. Amway and its sales force contributed a substantial amount (up to half) of the total funds ($669,525) for the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1994|1994 political campaign]] of Republican congresswoman and Amway distributor [[Sue Myrick]] (N.C.).&lt;ref name=burstein&gt;{{cite web| title = She Did it Amway | author=Rachel Burstein | magazine=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]| date = September–October 1996 | url = http://motherjones.com/politics/1996/09/she-did-it-amway| accessdate =May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to two reports by ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' magazine, Amway distributor Dexter Yager “used the company’s extensive voice-mail system to rally hundreds of Amway distributors into giving a total of $295,871” to Myrick’s campaign.&lt;ref name=burstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=zibrowski&gt;{{cite web| title = Tough sell| author=John Zibrowski, Jenna Ziman | magazine=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]| date = Nov–Dec 1998 | url = http://motherjones.com/politics/1998/11/tough-sell| accessdate =May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a campaign staffer quoted by the magazine, Myrick had appeared regularly on the Amway circuit, speaking at hundreds of rallies and selling $5 and $10 audiotapes.&lt;ref name=burstein/&gt; Following the 1994 election, Myrick maintained “close ties to Amway and Yager”, and raised $100,000 from Amway sources, “most notably through fundraisers at the homes of big distributors”, in the 1997–98 election cycle.&lt;ref name=zibrowski/&gt;

In October 1994, Amway gave the biggest corporate contribution recorded to that date to a political party for a single election – $2.5&amp;nbsp;million to the [[Republican National Committee]] – and was the number one corporate political donor in the U.S.&lt;ref name=burstein/&gt; In the [[2004 Elections|2004 election cycle]], the organization contributed a total of $4 million to a conservative [[527 group]], [[Progress for America]].&lt;ref&gt;From opensecrets.org: [http://www.opensecrets.org/527s/527cmtedetail.asp?ein=201170395&amp;cycle=2004&amp;format=&amp;tname=Progress+for+America Progress for America – Top Contributors, 2004 Cycle]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1996, Amway co-founder Richard DeVos was honored at a $3&amp;nbsp;million fundraiser for the Republican Party, and a week later, it was reported that Amway had tried to donate $1.3&amp;nbsp;million to pay for Republican &quot;infomercials&quot; and televising of the GOP convention on [[Pat Robertson]]'s [[Family Channel]], but backed off when Democrats criticized the donation as a ploy to avoid campaign-finance restrictions.&lt;ref name=burstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=vlasic&gt;{{Cite news | last = Vlasic | first = Bill  |author2=Mary Beth Regan | title = Amway II: The Kids take over |work=BusinessWeek   | date = February 16, 1998 | url = http://www.businessweek.com/archives/1998/b3565099.arc.htm?chan=search  | accessdate =May 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1997 Richard DeVos and his wife, Helen, gave $1&amp;nbsp;million to the Republican National Committee,&lt;ref name=zibrowski/&gt;&lt;ref name=vlasic/&gt; which at the time was the second-largest soft-money donation ever, behind Amway's 1994 gift of $2.5&amp;nbsp;million to the RNC.&lt;ref name=zibrowski/&gt; In July 1997, [[Senate Majority Leader|Senate Majority leader]] [[Trent Lott]] and [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]] slipped a last-minute provision into a hotly contested compromise tax bill that granted Amway a tax break on its Asian branches, saving it $19&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=zibrowski/&gt;

A 1998 analysis of campaign contributions conducted by ''[[Businessweek]]'' found that Amway, along with the founding families and some top distributors, had donated at least $7&amp;nbsp;million to GOP causes in the preceding decade.&lt;ref name=vlasic/&gt; Political candidates who received campaign funding from Amway in 1998 included Representatives [[Bill Redmond]] (R-N.M.), [[Heather Wilson]] (R-N.M.), and Jon Christensen (R-Neb).&lt;ref name=zibrowski/&gt;

According to a report by the [[Center for Public Integrity]], in the 2004 election cycle, members of the Van Andel and DeVos families were the second, third and fifth largest donors to the Republican party.&lt;ref name=MediaTransparency&gt;{{cite web|last=Houle|first=Dana|title=Bush Authoritarianism: Blackwater+Amway=GOP, Pt. 3|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/10/21/400840/-Bush-Authoritarianism:-Blackwater+AmwayGOP,-Pt-3|date = October 21, 2007| publisher=[[Daily Kos]]|accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transaction Publishers]], 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Patralekha Bhattacharya and Krishna Kumar Mehta, of the consulting firm Thinkalytics, LLC, reasoned that although some critics have referred to organizations such as Amway as &quot;cults&quot; and have speculated that they engage in &quot;mind control&quot;, there are other explanations that could account for the behavior of distributors. Namely, continued involvement of distributors despite minimal economic return may result from social satisfaction compensating for diminished economic satisfaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;bhattacharye-mehta&quot;&gt;''Socialization in network marketing organizations: is it cult behavior?'' by Patralekha Bhattacharya and Krishna Kumar Mehta, Journal of Socio-Economics. 29(4):361–374.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pyramid scheme accusations==

Amway utilizes a tiered distribution and remuneration model (the Amway ''Sales and Marketing Plan'') that promises to reward participants who grow Amway's market share through a combination of sales and recruitment. This tiered distribution model relies on Independent Business Owners (IBOs) acquiring and training further Independent Business Owners, which is the principal characteristic of a [[pyramid scheme]].

[[Harvard Business School]] of Leadership, which described Amway as “one of the most profitable direct selling companies in the world&quot;, noted that Amway founders Van Andel and DeVos:

:&quot;...accomplished their success through the use of an elaborate pyramid-like distribution system in which independent distributors of Amway products received a percentage of the merchandise they sold and also a percentage of the merchandise sold by recruited distributors. &quot;&lt;ref name=HarvardBS&gt;{{cite news|title=American Business Leaders of the Twentieth Century – Richard M.

The &quot;pyramid-like distribution system&quot; of the Amway business model led to Amway being accused of being a pyramid scheme. [[In re Amway Corp.|A 1979 US Federal Trade Commission ruling]] established that the Amway business model is not illegal in the United States.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The enforcement said that the [[business model]] of the company is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NULL |url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/hyderabad-police-shuts-down-amway-offices_242899.html |title=Hyderabad Police shuts down Amway offices |publisher=Moneycontrol.com |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ibtimes&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.in/articles/20061213/amway-mlm-business-model.htm|title=Amway in hot water in Hyderabad over &quot;business model&quot; controversy|last=Saha|first=Arijit |date=December 13, 2006|publisher=IB Times|accessdate=January 17, 2010}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) had notified the police that Amway in India may be violating certain laws regarding a &quot;money circulation scheme&quot; and the [[International Business Times|IB Times]] article writes that &quot;some say ... Amway is really more about making money from recruiting people to become distributors, as opposed to selling products.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ibtimes&quot;/&gt; The complaint was initiated following a dowry dispute between a local man and his wife, an Amway distributor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amway Back&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-09-30/hyderabad/27813355_1_amway-distributors-amway-offices-prize-chits |title=Indiatimes.com |work=The Times of India |date=September 30, 2006 |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a petition by Amway, the state High Court issued an injunction against the CID and stated the Act did not ''[[prima facie]]'' apply,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/2047951.cms |title=Amway back to business in state |work=The Times of India |date=September 30, 2006 |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; however after Amway requested the CID petition be dismissed the High Court declared that if police allegations were true, Amway's [[India]]n subsidiary would be in violation of the act and the investigation should continue. On August 14, 2007, the Supreme Court of India ordered the state police to complete the investigation against Amway in 6 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://replay.web.archive.org/20090112071926/http://www.business-standard.com/india/storypage.php?tp=on&amp;autono=26541 |title=SC asks Andhra to finish Amway probe in 6 mths |publisher=Replay.web.archive.org |date=January 12, 2009 |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, citing the High Court decision, the Andhra Pradesh state government enacted a ban on Amway media advertisements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ban on Amway Chits, Schemes&quot;/&gt; Amway challenged the ban and in July 2009 the AP High Court refused a petition the ban should be enforced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccanchronicle.com/hyderabad/stay-order-against-former-ghmc-chief-174 No Direction on Amway Ads]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2009 the original 2006 CID case was still pending at the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Court in Hyderabad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccanchronicle.com/hyderabad/hc-no-stay-raju-questioning-289 Writ Against Amway]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 6, 2011 [[Kerala Police]] sealed the offices of Amway at [[Kozhikode]], [[Kannur]], [[Kochi]], [[Kottayam]], [[Thrissur]], [[Kollam]] and [[Thiruvananthapuram]] following complaints.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kerala raids&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Amway-offices-raided-at-nine-places/Article1-730172.aspx |title=Amway offices raided at nine places|work=Hindustan Times |location=India|date=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathrubhumi.com/english/story.php?id=112554 |title=Police raid at Amway offices |publisher=Mathrubhumi English |date=2011-08-06 |accessdate=2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/article481246.ece |title=Statewide raids on Amway offices |publisher=The New Indian Express |date=2011-08-07 |accessdate=2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amway stated that &quot;it had been receiving complaints from distributors over the past one month that they were being called to police stations and being 'harassed' to give complaints against the company&quot;. The distributors faced a tough time because of the lack of proactive steps and slow actions from the company management.

The [[Kerala High Court]] on November 9 directed the DGP, [[Kerala Police]] to file a statement regarding the status of the investigation initiated against the multi-level marketing companies. A Division Bench comprising Acting Chief Justice [[Manjula Chellur]] and Justice C N Ramachandran Nair issued the directive while considering a petition challenging the government order regarding the Kerala direct selling regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/article241845.ece |title=Money chain fraud: DGP asked to file statement |publisher=The New Indian Express |date=2011-11-10 |accessdate=2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 2012, The Economic Offences Wing of Kerala Police, conducted searches at the offices of Amway at Kozhikode, Thrissur and Kannur as part of its crackdown on money chain activities and closed down  the firm's godowns at these centres. Products valued at Rs.2.14 crore were also seized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/searches-conducted-on-amway-offices/article4084066.ece |title=Searches conducted on Amway offices |publisher=The Hindu |date=2012-11-10 |accessdate=2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Area manager of Amway, P.M.

On 27 May 2013, Crime Branch officials of [[Kerala Police]] arrested William S. Pinckney, Managing Director &amp; CEO of Amway India Enterprises along with two other directors of the company from [[Kozhikode]]. The three were arrested on charges of running a pyramid scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanandakumar|first=S|title=Amway India Chairman William S Pinckney, two Directors granted bail|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/amway-india-chairman-william-s-pinckney-two-directors-granted-bail/articleshow/20314744.cms|accessdate=28 May 2014|newspaper=The Economic Times|date=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathrubhumi.com/business/news_articles/amway-ceo-pinkni-scott-and-two-directors-arrested-363981.html |title=Amway India CEO William Scott Pinckney arrested Mathrubhumi Business |publisher=Mathrubhumi |accessdate=2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were granted bail the next day and the business was unaffected.

===Class action settlement===

On November 3, 2010, Amway announced that it had agreed to pay $56&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;– $34&amp;nbsp;million in cash and $22&amp;nbsp;million in products&amp;nbsp;– to settle a [[class action]] that had been filed in Federal District Court in California in 2007.&lt;ref name=classaction&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Knape |url=http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2010/11/amway_agrees_to_pay_56_million.html#incart_mce |title=Amway agrees to pay $56 million, settle case alleging it operates a 'pyramid scheme' |date=November 2010 |publisher=MLive.com |accessdate=July 9, 2011|work=The Grand Rapids Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The class action, which had been brought against Quixtar and several of its top-level distributors, alleged fraud, [[racketeering]], and that the defendants operated as an illegal pyramid scheme.

While noting that the settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing or liability, Amway acknowledged that it had made changes to its business operations as a result of the lawsuit. The settlement is subject to approval by the court, which was expected in early 2011.&lt;ref name=classaction/&gt; The economic value of the settlement, including the changes Amway made to its business model, totals $100&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2010/11/lawyers_say_their_20_million_p.html |title=&quot;Lawyers say their $20 million payment is fair for $100 million settlement in Amway pyramid scheme lawsuit&quot;, '&amp;#39;Grand Rapids Press'&amp;#39; (November 4, 2010) |publisher=Mlive.com |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other legal actions==

===Canadian tax case===
In 1983, Amway pleaded guilty to criminal [[tax evasion]] and [[Customs (tax)|customs]] fraud in Canada, resulting in a fine of $25&amp;nbsp;million CAD, the largest fine ever imposed in Canada at the time. In 1989 the company settled the outstanding customs duties for $45&amp;nbsp;million CAD.&lt;ref name=CanadaTax&gt;{{Cite news

In a 1994 interview, Amway co-founder Rich DeVos stated that this incident had been his greatest &quot;moral or spiritual challenge&quot;, first in &quot;soul searching as to whether they had done anything wrong&quot; and then for pleading guilty for technical reasons, despite believing they were innocent of the charges. DeVos stated he believed that the case had been motivated by &quot;political reasons&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rich DeVos |url=http://www.acton.org/pub/religion-liberty/volume-4-number-5/capitalism-compassion |title=Capitalism with Compassion, '&amp;#39;Religion and Liberty'&amp;#39;,'&amp;#39;Volume 4'&amp;#39;,'&amp;#39;Number 5'&amp;#39; |publisher=Acton.org |accessdate=July 9, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110608124404/http://www.acton.org/pub/religion-liberty/volume-4-number-5/capitalism-compassion| archivedate= June 8, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RIAA lawsuit===
The [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), as part of its anti-piracy efforts, sued Amway and several distributors in 1996, alleging that copyrighted music was used on &quot;highly profitable&quot; training videotapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E4D61339F932A15751C0A960958260 |title=Record Labels Sue Amway over its videos |work=New York Times |date=February 21, 1996 |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amway denied wrongdoing, blaming the case on a misunderstanding by distributors, and settled the case out of court for $9&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-19783607.html |title=Amway pays $9&amp;nbsp;million to settle copyright infringement suit |publisher=Highbeam.com |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a related lawsuit initiated by the distributors involved, the Court established that Mahaleel Lee Luster, who had been contracted to make the videotapes, had violated copyright without the knowledge of three of the five of those distributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/199914123.OPN.pdf |title='&amp;#39;Foley v Luster'&amp;#39; |format=PDF |accessdate=July 9, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110722093115/http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/199914123.OPN.pdf| archivedate= July 22, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Welcome to Life'' (Poland)===
In 1997, Amway Poland and [[Network TwentyOne]] separately sued the makers of a Polish film ''Welcome to Life'' for defamation and copyright violations.

In 2001 a regional court ruled in favor of Network 21; however, in 2004 the Warsaw Regional Court dismissed Amway's civil lawsuit.

On 18 December 2012 the court ruled that film can be screened, but the makers have to remove &quot;untrue informations&quot;, as the screen near the end of the movie stated that 30% of company income is generated by sales of training materials and that the vast majority of its profits are shared only by the tiny fraction of top distributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrzej Biernat, poseł PO o zachowaniu Jarosława Gowina |url=http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114871,13073248,Koniec_procesu_ws__Amway__TVP_moze_pokazac_film__ale.html#BoxWiadTxt?lokale=wroclaw |title=Wiadomości - Gazeta.pl |language=pl |publisher=Wiadomosci.gazeta.pl |date= |accessdate=2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not the only court case, so the film is still banned on other grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114883,13074755,Rezyser_filmu_o_Amwayu_szczerze_o_wyroku__Nikt_nic.html#BoxWiadTxt?lokale=wroclaw |title=Reżyser filmu o Amwayu szczerze o wyroku: Nikt nic nie rozumie, czyli 'Witajcie w życiu' [WYWIAD&amp;#93; |language=pl |publisher=Wiadomosci.gazeta.pl |date=2012-12-18 |accessdate=2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dr. Phil and Shape Up===
In March 2004, TV personality [[Phil McGraw]] (aka Dr. Phil) pulled his &quot;Shape Up&quot; line of supplements off the market in the face of an investigation by the [[U.S. Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC). The supplements were manufactured by CSA Nutraceuticals, a subsidiary of Alticor’s Access Business Group.&lt;ref name=Dembling&gt;{{cite book|last= Sophia Dembling and Lisa Gutierrez|title=The making of Dr. Phil: the straight-talking true story of everyone's|year=2003|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=|page=181|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FTC later dropped the probe; however, in October 2005, a [[class-action lawsuit]] was filed against McGraw by several people who used the products and claimed that the supplements, which cost $120 per month, did not stimulate weight loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;ctv&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20051007/drphil_classaction_051007/20051007/|title=Class-action status sought in Dr. Phil diet suit|accessdate=October 21, 2007|publisher=CTV Globe Media|year=2005|author=CTV.ca News Staff| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071013143537/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20051007/drphil_classaction_051007/20051007/| archivedate= October 13, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2006, a $10.5&amp;nbsp;million settlement was reached, in which Alticor agreed to provide $4.5&amp;nbsp;million in cash and $6&amp;nbsp;million in Nutrilite products to disgruntled users of Shape Up.&lt;ref name=&quot;usaap&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-09-26-dr-phil-diet_x.htm|title=Settlement reached on Dr. Phil diet plan|accessdate=October 21, 2007|publisher=[[USA Today]] – [[Associated Press]]|agency=Associated Press | date=September 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.casewatch.org/civil/drphil/settlement.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=9791 |title=News+Views: Slimming the Amway |newspaper=Metro Times |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.cnn.com/2005-10-04/justice/dr.phil_1_low-calorie-diet-dieters-class-action?_s=PM:LAW |publisher=CNN | title=California judge gives tentative OK to Toyota class-action suit | date=November 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dateline NBC===
In 2004, ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' featured a critical report based on a yearlong undercover investigation of business practices within the Amway organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;DATELINE&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

  | accessdate =July 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report noted that the average distributor makes only about $1,400 per year and that many of the “high level distributors singing the praises of Quixtar [Amway]” are actually “making most of their money by selling motivational books, tapes and seminars; not Quixtar’s cosmetics, soaps, and electronics.”

:&quot;In fact, about twenty high level distributors are part of an exclusive club; one that those hundreds of thousands of other distributors don’t get to join. For years only a privileged few, including Bill Britt, have run hugely profitable businesses selling all those books tapes and seminars; things the rank and file distributors can’t sell themselves but, are told over and over again, they need to buy in order to succeed.&quot;

It was also revealed that an Amway recruiter featured in the report (Greg Fredericks) made misleading and inconsistent statements about Amway earnings during a recruitment meeting and had an outstanding [[arrest warrant]] for [[drug dealing]].&lt;ref name=DATELINE/&gt;
