Antigen
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Antibody.svg|thumb|255px]]In [[immunology]], an '''antigen''' (Ag), abbreviation of '''anti'''body '''gen'''erator, is any structural substance which serves as a target for the receptors of an adaptive immune response, [[T-cell receptor|TCR]] or [[B-cell receptor|BCR]] or its secreted form [[antibody]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Molecular Biology of the Cell |edition=4th |authors=Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, et al. |location=New York |publisher=Garland Science |year=2002 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21070/ |chapter=24.

[[Paul Ehrlich]] coined the term [[Antibody#History|antibody]] (in German ''Antikörper'') in his [[side-chain theory]] at the end of 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strebhardt|first=Klaus|author2=Ullrich, Axel|title=Paul Ehrlich's magic bullet concept: 100 years of progress|journal=Nature Reviews Cancer|date=Jun 2008|volume=8|issue=6|pages=473–480|doi=10.1038/nrc2394|pmid=18469827|issn=1474-1768}}&lt;/ref&gt; In summary, an antigen is a molecule that binds to Ag-specific receptors but cannot induce an immune response in the body by itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gavin|first1=AL|last2=Hoebe|first2=K|last3=Duong|first3=B|last4=Ota|first4=T|last5=Martin|first5=C|last6=Beutler|first6=B|last7=Nemazee|first7=D|title=Adjuvant-enhanced antibody responses in the absence of toll-like receptor signaling.|journal=Science (New York, N.Y.)|date=22 December 2006|volume=314|issue=5807|pages=1936–8|pmid=17185603}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antigen was originally a structural molecule that binds specifically to the antibody, but the term now also refers to any molecule or a linear fragment that can be recognized by highly variable antigen receptors ([[B-cell receptor]] or [[T-cell receptor]]) of the adaptive immune system.

The antigen may originate from within the body (&quot;self&quot;) or from the external environment (&quot;non-self&quot;). The immune system is usually non-reactive against &quot;self&quot; antigens under normal homeostatic conditions due to [[Negative selection (immunology)|negative selection]] of [[T-cell|T cells]] in the [[thymus]] and is supposed to identify and attack only &quot;non-self&quot; invaders from the outside world or modified/harmful substances present in the body under [[Danger model|distressed conditions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gallucci|first1=S|last2=Lolkema|first2=M|last3=Matzinger|first3=P|title=Natural adjuvants: endogenous activators of dendritic cells.|journal=Nature medicine|date=November 1999|volume=5|issue=11|pages=1249–55|pmid=10545990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antigen presenting cell]]s present the antigen structures in the form of processed antigenic peptides to the [[T cell]]s of the [[adaptive immune system]] via a [[histocompatibility molecule]]. Depending on the antigen presented and the type of the histocompatibility molecule, several types of [[T cell]]s can become activated. For [[T-cell receptor|T-Cell Receptor (TCR)]] recognition, it must be processed into small fragments inside the cell and presented to a T-cell receptor by [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC).&lt;ref&gt;Parham, Peter.

An [[immunogen]] is an analogy to the antigen a substance (or a mixture of substances) that is able to provoke an [[immune response]] if injected to the body.&lt;ref&gt;Parham, Peter. (2009). The Immune System, 3rd Edition, pg. G:11, Garland Science, Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.&lt;/ref&gt; An immunogen is able to '''initiate''' an indispensable [[innate immune system|innate immune response]] first, later leading to the activation of the [[adaptive immune system|adaptive immune response]], whereas an antigen is able to '''bind''' the highly variable immunoreceptor products ([[B-cell receptor]] or [[T-cell receptor]]) once these have been generated previously. Therefore, the overlapping concepts of '''immunogenicity''' and '''antigenicity''' are clearly different. According to current textbook notions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Immunogenicity is the ability to induce a humoral and/or cell-mediated immune response&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Antigenicity is the ability to combine specifically with the final products of the [[immune response]] (i.e. secreted antibodies and/or surface receptors on T-cells). Although all immunogenic molecules are also antigenic, the reverse is not true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kuby Immunology |edition=6th |publisher=Macmillan |year=2006 |pages=77 |isbn=978-1-4292-0211-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the molecular level, an antigen can be characterized by its ability to be bound by the [[Fragment antigen-binding|variable Fab region]] of an antibody. Note also that different antibodies have the potential to discriminate between specific [[epitope]]s present on the surface of the antigen (as illustrated in the Figure). [[Hapten]] is a small molecule that changes the structure of an antigenic epitope. In order to induce an immune response, it has to be attached to a large carrier molecule such as protein. 
Antigens are usually [[protein]]s and [[polysaccharide]]s, less frequently also [[lipid]]s. This includes parts (coats, capsules, cell walls, flagella, fimbrae, and toxins) of [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es, and other [[microorganism]]s. [[Lipid]]s and [[nucleic acid]]s are antigenic only when combined with proteins and polysaccharides.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Non-microbial exogenous (non-self) antigens can include pollen, egg white, and proteins from transplanted tissues and organs or on the surface of transfused blood cells. [[Vaccine]]s are examples of antigens in an immunogenic form, which are to be intentionally administered to induce the memory function of [[adaptive immune system]] toward the antigens of the pathogen invading the recipient.

==Related concepts==
* '''[[Epitope]]''' – The distinct molecular surface features of an antigen capable of being bound by an antibody (a.k.a. ''antigenic determinant''). Antigenic molecules, normally being &quot;large&quot; biological polymers, usually present several surface features that can act as points of interaction for specific antibodies. Any such distinct molecular feature constitutes an epitope. Therefore, most antigens have the potential to be bound by several distinct antibodies, each of which specific to a particular epitope. Using the &quot;lock and key&quot; metaphor, the antigen itself can be seen as a string of keys – any epitope being a &quot;key&quot; – each of which matching a different lock. Different antibody '''[[idiotypes]]''', each having distinctly formed [[complementarity determining region]]s, correspond to the various &quot;locks&quot; that can match &quot;the keys&quot; (epitopes) presented on the antigen molecule.
* '''[[Allergen]]''' – A substance capable of causing an [[allergic reaction]]. The (detrimental) reaction may result after exposure via ingestion, inhalation, injection, or contact with skin.
* '''[[Superantigen]]''' – A class of antigens that cause non-specific activation of T-cells, resulting in polyclonal T cell activation and massive cytokine release.
* '''[[Tolerogen]]''' – A substance that invokes a specific immune non-responsiveness due to its [[molecular form]]. If its molecular form is changed, a tolerogen can become an immunogen.
* '''[[Immunoglobulin]]-binding protein''' – These proteins are capable of binding to antibodies at positions outside of the antigen-binding site. That is, whereas antigens are the &quot;target&quot; of antibodies, immunoglobulin-binding proteins &quot;attack&quot; antibodies. [[Protein A]], [[protein G]], and [[protein L]] are examples of proteins that strongly bind to various antibody [[Isotype (immunology)|isotypes]].
* '''T-dependent antigen''' – T-dependent antigens are usually proteins. They require an assistance of T cells to induce the formation of specific antibodies.

==Origin of the term antigen==
In 1899, [[László Detre (physician)|Ladislas Deutsch (Laszlo Detre)]] (1874–1939) named the hypothetical substances halfway between bacterial constituents and antibodies &quot;substances immunogenes ou antigenes&quot; (antigenic or immunogenic substances). He originally believed those substances to be precursors of antibodies, just as [[zymogen]] is a precursor of an enzyme. But, by 1903, he understood that an antigen induces the production of immune bodies (antibodies) and wrote that the word ''antigen'' is a contraction of '''Anti'''somato'''gen'''(= &quot;Immunkörperbildner&quot;). The Oxford English Dictionary indicates that the logical construction should be &quot;anti(body)-gen&quot;.&lt;ref name=Lindenmann&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lindenmann, Jean  |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119531625/PDFSTART |title=Origin of the Terms 'Antibody' and 'Antigen' |journal=Scand.

==Origin of antigens==
Antigens can be classified in order of their class.

===Exogenous antigens===
Exogenous antigens are antigens that have entered the body from the outside, for example by [[inhalation]], [[ingestion]], or [[Injection (medicine)|injection]]. The immune system's response to exogenous antigens is often subclinical. By [[endocytosis]] or [[phagocytosis]], exogenous antigens are taken into the [[antigen-presenting cell]]s (APCs) and processed into fragments. APCs then present the fragments to [[T helper cells]] ([[CD4]]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) by the use of [[MHC class II|class II histocompatibility]] molecules on their surface. Some T cells are specific for the peptide:MHC complex. They become activated and start to secrete [[cytokine]]s. Cytokines are substances that can activate [[cytotoxic T lymphocytes]] (CTL), antibody-secreting [[B cells]], [[macrophages]], and other particles.

Some antigens start out as exogenontigens, and later become endogenous (for example, intracellular viruses). Intracellular antigens can again be released back into circulation upon the destruction of the infected cell.

===Endogenous antigens===
Endogenous antigens are antigens that have been generated within previously normal cells as a result of normal cell [[metabolism]], or because of viral or intracellular bacterial [[infection]]. The fragments are then presented on the cell surface in the complex with [[MHC class I]] molecules. If activated [[Cytotoxic T cell|cytotoxic CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells]] recognize them, the T cells begin to secrete various [[toxin]]s that cause the [[lysis]] or [[apoptosis]] of the infected cell. In order to keep the cytotoxic cells from killing cells just for presenting self-proteins, self-reactive T cells are deleted from the repertoire as a result of [[Central tolerance|tolerance]] (also known as negative selection). Endogenous antigens include [[xenogenic]] (heterologous), [[autologous]] and [[idiotype|idiotypic]] or [[immunoglobulin allotype|allogenic]] (homologous) antigens.

===Autoantigens===
An [[autoantigen]] is usually a normal protein or complex of proteins (and sometimes DNA or RNA) that is recognized by the immune system of patients suffering from a specific [[autoimmune disease]]. These antigens should not be, under normal conditions, the target of the immune system, but, due mainly to genetic and environmental factors, the normal [[immunological tolerance]] for such an antigen has been lost in these patients.

==Tumor antigens==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Immune system]] --&gt;
''[[Tumor antigen]]s'' or ''neoantigens'' are{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} those antigens that are presented by [[MHC I]] or [[MHC II]] molecules on the surface of [[tumor cell]]s. These antigens can sometimes be presented by tumor cells and never by the normal ones. In this case, they are called [[tumor-specific antigen]]s (TSAs) and, in general, result from a tumor-specific mutation. More common are antigens that are presented by tumor cells and normal cells, and they are called [[tumor-associated antigen]]s (TAAs). [[Cytotoxic T lymphocytes]] that recognize these antigens may be able to destroy the tumor cells before they proliferate or [[metastasize]].

Tumor antigens can also be on the surface of the tumor in the form of, for example, a mutated receptor, in which case they will be recognized by [[B cells]].

==Nativity==
A '''native antigen''' is an antigen that is not yet processed by an APC to smaller parts. [[T cells]] cannot bind native antigens, but require that they be processed by APCs, whereas [[B cells]] can be activated by native ones.

==Antigenic specificity==
'''Antigen(ic) specificity''' is the ability of the host cells to recognize an antigen specifically as a unique molecular entity and distinguish it from another with exquisite precision. Antigen specificity is due primarily to the side-chain conformations of the antigen. It is a measurement, although the degree of specificity may not be easy to measure, and need not be linear or of the nature of a rate-limited step or equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steadyhealth.com/encyclopedia/Antigen_specificity |title=Antigen specificity - Medical Terms |publisher=Steadyhealth.com |date=2010-12-17 |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
