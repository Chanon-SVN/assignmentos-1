The '''Acropolis of Athens''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀκρόπολις}};&lt;ref&gt;[[Thucydides]] 2.15.3: &quot;ἡ Ἀκρόπολις ἡ νῦν οὖσα πόλις ῆν&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-ell|Ακρόπολη Αθηνών}}) is an ancient [[citadel]] located on a high rocky outcrop above the city of [[Athens]] and contains the remains of several [[Ancient Greek architecture|ancient buildings]] of great architectural and historic significance, the most famous being the [[Parthenon]].  The word  [[acropolis]] comes from the Greek  words {{lang|grc|ἄκρον}} (''akron'', &quot;edge, extremity&quot;) and {{lang|grc|πόλις}} (''polis'', &quot;city&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;acro-. (n.d.).

While there is evidence that the hill was inhabited as far back as the fourth millennium BC, it was [[Pericles]] (c. 495 – 429 BC) in the fifth century BC who coordinated the construction of the site's most important buildings including the [[Parthenon]], the [[Propylaia]], the [[Erechtheion]] and the temple of [[Athena Nike]].&lt;ref&gt;Hurwit 2000, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/3/eh351.jsp?obj_id=2384 &quot;History&quot;], Odysseus.

==History==
===Early settlement===
[[File:Dionisov teatar u Akropolju.jpg|thumb|Present-day remains of the [[Theatre of Dionysus]].]]

The Acropolis is located on a flat-topped rock that rises {{convert|150|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level in the city of [[Athens]], with a surface area of about {{convert|3|ha}}. It was also known as '''Cecropia''', after the legendary [[snake|serpent]]-man, [[Cecrops I|Cecrops]], the first Athenian king. 
While the earliest artifacts date to the Middle [[Neolithic]] era, there have been documented habitations in [[Attica]] from the Early Neolithic (6th millennium BC). There is little doubt that a [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] [[megaron]] stood upon the hill during the late [[Aegean civilization|Bronze Age]]. Nothing of this [[megaron]] survives except, probably, a single limestone column-base and pieces of several sandstone steps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Castleden&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Castleden|first=Rodney|title=Mycenaeans|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Kfi0dAlfJaoC&amp;pg=PA64|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-22782-2|pages=64–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the palace was constructed, a [[Cyclopean]] massive circuit wall was built, 760 meters long, up to 10 meters high, and ranging from 3.5 to 6 meters thick. This wall would serve as the main defense for the acropolis until the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwit 2000, p. 74-75.&lt;/ref&gt; The wall consisted of two [[parapet]]s built with large stone blocks and cemented with an earth mortar called ''emplekton'' (Greek: ἔμπλεκτον).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3De%29%2Fmplektos ἔμπλεκτος],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; The wall follows typical Mycenaean convention in that  it followed the natural contour of the terrain and its gate was arranged obliquely, with a parapet and tower overhanging the incomers' right-hand side, thus facilitating defense. There were two lesser approaches up the hill on its north side, consisting of steep, narrow flights of steps cut in the rock.  [[Homer]] is assumed to refer to this fortification when he mentions the &quot;strong-built House of [[Erechtheus]]&quot; (''[[Odyssey]]'' 7.81). At some point before the 13th century BC, an earthquake caused a fissure near the northeastern edge of the Acropolis. This fissure extended some 35 meters to a bed of soft marl in which a well was dug.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwit 2000, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; An elaborate set of stairs was built and the well served as an invaluable, protected source of drinking water during times of siege for some portion of the Mycenaean period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydriaproject.net/en/cases/athens/acropolis_hill/mycenaean.html &quot;The springs and fountains of the Acropolis hill&quot;], Hydria Project.

===The Dark Ages===
There is no conclusive evidence for the existence of a Mycenean palace on top of the Athenian Acropolis. However, if there was such a palace, it seems to have been supplanted by later building activity. Not much is known as to the architectural appearance of the Acropolis until the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic era]]. In the 7th and the 6th centuries BC, the site was taken over by [[Cylon (ancient Athenian)|Kylon]] during the failed Kylonian revolt,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pomeroy1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Pomeroy|first=Sarah B.|title=Ancient Greece: A Political, Social, and Cultural History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=INUT5sZku1UC&amp;pg=PA163|year=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-509742-9|pages=163–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and twice by [[Peisistratos]]: all attempts directed at seizing political power by ''[[coup|coups d'état]]''. Peisistratos built an entry gate or [[Propylaea]] and perhaps embarked on the construction of an earlier temple on the site of the Parthenon where fragments of sculptured limestone have been found as well as the foundations of a large unfinished temple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/448916/Peisistratus &quot;Peisistratos&quot;], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved 2 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it seems that a nine-gate wall, the ''[[Enneapylon]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://odysseus.culture.gr/h/2/eh251.jsp?obj_id=8242 &quot;Acropolis fortification wall&quot;], Odysseus. Retrieved 2 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; had been built around the biggest water spring, the &quot;[[Water clock|Clepsydra]]&quot;, at the northwestern foot.

===Archaic Acropolis===
A temple to ''[[Athena|Athena Polias]]'' (protectress of the city) was erected around 570–550 BC. This [[Doric order|Doric]] limestone building, from which many relics survive, is referred to as the ''[[Hekatompedon temple|Hekatompedon]]'' (Greek for &quot;hundred–footed&quot;), ''Ur-Parthenon'' (German for &quot;original Parthenon&quot; or &quot;primitive Parthenon&quot;), ''H–Architecture'' or ''Bluebeard'' temple, after the pedimental three-bodied man-serpent sculpture, whose beards were painted dark blue. Whether this temple replaced an older one, or just a sacred precinct or altar, is not known. Probably, the ''Hekatompedon'' was built where the Parthenon now stands.&lt;ref&gt;Hurwit 2000, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 529–520 BC yet another temple was built by the [[Peisistratid]]s, the [[Old Temple of Athena]], usually referred to as the ''Arkhaios Neōs'' (ἀρχαῖος νεώς, &quot;ancient temple&quot;). This temple of Athena Polias was built upon the ''Doerpfeld'' foundations,&lt;ref&gt;Hurwit 2000, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; between the [[Erechtheion]] and the still-standing Parthenon. ''Arkhaios Neōs'' was destroyed by the Persian invasion in 480 BC. However, the temple was probably reconstructed since in 454 BC the treasury of the [[Delian League]] was transferred in its [[opisthodomos]]. The temple may have been burnt down in 406/405 BC as [[Xenophon]] mentions that the old temple of Athena was set on fire. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] does not mention it in his 2nd century AD ''Description of Greece''.&lt;ref&gt;{{el icon}} [http://www.eie.gr/archaeologia/gr/02_DELTIA/Old_Temple_of_Athena.aspx], Retrieved 5 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 500 BC the ''Ur-Parthenon'' was dismantled to make place for a newer and grander building, the &quot;[[Older Parthenon]]&quot; (often called ''Pre-Parthenon'', &quot;early Parthenon&quot;). Athenians decided to stop the construction of the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus, Athens|Olympieion]] which was related with the tyrant [[Peisistratos]] and his sons and instead used the [[Piraeus]] limestone destined for the Olympieion to build the Older Parthenon. To accommodate it, the south part of the summit was cleared, made level by adding some 8,000 two-ton blocks of limestone, a foundation {{convert|11|m|0|abbr=on}} deep at some points, and the rest filled with earth kept in place by the retaining wall. However, after the victorious [[Battle of Marathon]] in 490 BC, the plan was revised and marble was used instead. The limestone phase of the building is referred to as ''Pre-Parthenon I'', the marble phase as ''Pre-Parthenon II''. In 485 BC, construction stalled to save resources as [[Xerxes I of Persia|Xerxes]] took the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Manolis Korres, [http://www.eie.gr/archaeologia/En/chapter_more_3.aspx ''Topographic Issues of the Acropolis''], Archaeology of the City of Athens; Retrieved 7 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Older Parthenon was still under construction when the Persians sacked the city in 480 BC. The building was burned and looted, along with the ''Ancient Temple'' and practically everything else on the rock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/artifact;jsessionid=7EAE195E7827EA194D2FFC77288CE706?name=Athens%2C+Pre-Parthenon&amp;object=Building &quot;Athens, Pre-Parthenon (Building)&quot;], ''Perseus Digital Library''.

The devastated site was cleared of debris. Statuary, cult objects, religious offerings and unsalvageable architectural members were buried ceremoniously in several deeply dug pits on the hill, serving conveniently as a fill for the artificial plateau created around the classic Parthenon. This [[Perserschutt|&quot;Persian debris&quot;]] is the richest archaeological deposit excavated on the Acropolis and is well known throughout Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Kavvadias, Panagiotis, Kawerau, Georg: ''Die Ausgrabung der Akropolis vom Jahre 1885 bis zum Jahre 1890'', Athens, 1906 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After winning at [[Battle of the Eurymedon|Eurymedon]] in 468 BC, [[Cimon]] and [[Themistocles]] ordered the reconstruction of the  southern and northern walls of the Acropolis. Most of the major temples, including the [[Parthenon]], were rebuilt under the leadership of [[Pericles]] during the [[Age of Pericles|Golden Age of Athens]] (460–430 BC). [[Phidias]], a great Athenian sculptor, and [[Ictinus]] and [[Callicrates]], two famous architects, were responsible for the reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greatbuildings.com/architects/Ictinus_and_Callicrates_wi.html &quot;Ictinus and Callicrates with Phidias&quot;], ''Architecture Week''.

In 437 BC, [[Mnesicles]] started building the [[Propylaea]], a monumental gate at the western end of the Acropolis with [[Doric order|Doric]] columns of [[Pentelic]] [[marble]], partly built upon the old propylaea of Peristratus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/386642/Mnesicles &quot;Mnesicles&quot;], ''Brtiannica.com'' Retrieved 6 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; These colonnades were almost finished in 432 BC and had two wings, the northern one decorated with paintings by [[Polygnotus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McCulloch1841&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=McCulloch|first=John Ramsay|title=A Dictionary, Geographical, Statistical, and Historical: Of the Various Countries, Places and Principal Natural Objects in the World|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ufYRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA205|year=1841|publisher=Longman, Orme, Brown, Green and Longmans|pages=205–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, south of the Propylaea, building started on the small Ionic [[Temple of Athena Nike]] in Pentelic marble with [[tetrastyle]] porches, preserving the essentials of Greek temple design.

Construction of the elegant temple of [[Erechtheion]] in Pentelic marble (421–406 BC) was in accordance with a complex plan which took account of the extremely uneven ground and the need to circumvent several shrines in the area. The entrance, facing east, is lined with six Ionic columns. Unusually, the temple has two porches, one on the northwest corner borne by Ionic columns, the other, to the southwest, supported by huge female figures or [[Caryatid]]s. The eastern part of the temple was dedicated to [[Athena Polias]], while the western part, serving the cult of the archaic king [[Erechtheus|Poseidon-Erechtheus]], housed the altars of [[Hephaestus]] and Voutos, brother of Erechtheus. Little is known about the original plan of the interior which was destroyed by fire in the first century BC and has been rebuilt several times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancient-greece.org/architecture/erechtheion.html Thomas Sakoulas, &quot;Erechtheion&quot;], Ancient-Greece.org.

==The Acropolis Restoration Project==
[[File:Acropolis under construction 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Looking east toward the Acropolis under construction in summer 2014.]]
The Project began in 1975 and is now nearing completion.  The aim of the restoration was to reverse the decay of centuries of attrition, pollution, destruction by acts of war, and misguided past restorations.  The project included collection and identification of all stone fragments, even small ones, from the Acropolis and its slopes and the attempt was made to restore as much as possible using reassembled original material ([[Anastylosis]]) - with new marble from [[Mount Penteli]] used sparingly.  All restoration was made using [[titanium]] dowels and is designed to be completely reversible, in case future experts decide to change things.  A combination of cutting-edge modern technology and extensive research and reinvention of ancient techniques were used.&lt;ref name=umich&gt;[http://www.lsa.umich.edu/UMICH/modgreek/Home/Window%20to%20Greek%20Culture/Lectures%20at%20U-M/LaUM_Mallouchou_restorationacropolis.pdf Fani Mallouchou-Tufano, &quot;The Restoration of the Athenian Acropolis&quot;], University of Michigan. Retrieved 9 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parthenon colonnades, largely destroyed by Venetian bombardment in the 17th century, were restored, with many wrongly assembled columns now properly placed.  The roof and floor of the Propylaea were partly restored, with sections of the roof made of new marble and decorated with blue and gold inserts, as in the original.&lt;ref name=umich/&gt; Restoration of the Temple of Athena Nike was completed in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ysma.gr/static/files/Newsletter11_ENG.pdf &quot;2010 – 2011, The progress of restoration on the Acropolis&quot;], ''The Acropolis Restoration News'', July 2011. Retrieved 9 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 2,675 tons of architectural members were restored, with 686 stones reassembled from fragments of the originals, 905 patched with new marble, and 186 parts made entirely of new marble.  A total of 530 cubic meters of new Pentelic marble were used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/hellenic/ &quot;Acropolis Restoration Project-Lecture by Maria Ioannidou, Director, Acropolis Restoration Service&quot;], Columbia University. Retrieved 9 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural significance==
Every four years, the Athenians held a festival called the [[Panathenaea]] that rivaled the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] in popularity. During the festival, a procession (believed to be depicted on the Parthenon frieze) traveled through the city via the Panathenaic Way and culminated on the Acropolis.  There, a new robe of woven wool (''[[peplos]]'') was placed on either the statue of Athena Polias in the Erechtheum (during a regular Panathenaea) or on the statue of Athena Parthenos in the Parthenon (during the Great Panathenaea, held every four years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://depthome.brooklyn.cuny.edu/classics/dunkle/athnlife/rligious.htm |title=Panathenaic Festical}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the later tradition of [[Western Civilization]] and [[classicism|classical revival]] the Acropolis, from at least the mid-18th century on, has often been invoked as a key symbol of the Greek legacy and of the glories of [[Classical Greece]].
