'''Atle Selberg''' (14 June 1917 &amp;ndash; 6 August 2007) was a [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[mathematician]] known for his work in [[analytic number theory]], and in the theory of [[automorphic form]]s, in particular bringing them into relation with [[spectral theory]]. He was awarded the [[Fields Medal]] in 1950.

== Early years ==
Selberg was born in [[Langesund]], [[Norway]], the son of teacher Anna Kristina Selberg and mathematician [[Ole Michael Ludvigsen Selberg]]. Two of his brothers also went on to become mathematicians as well, and the remaining one became a professor of engineering. 
&lt;!-- There seems to be no source for the following anecdote, and the reference given does not mention Selberg:
His first result came at age 14 when he found[[Johann Bernoulli]]'s  remarkable 1697 formula
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty n^{-n} = \int_0^1 x^{-x} dx\quad\quad(=1.291285997...)&lt;/math&gt;
which he published as a problem in the book ''Problems and Theorems in Analysis'' (part I, problem 160) by [[Pólya]] and [[Gábor Szegö]].
--&gt;
While he was still at school he was influenced by the work of [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] and he found the exact analytical formula for the [[Partition (number theory)#Partition function|partition function]] as suggested by the works of Ramanujan; however, this result was first published by [[Hans Rademacher]]. During the war he fought against the German invasion of Norway, and was imprisoned several times. 
He studied at the [[University of Oslo]] and completed his [[Ph.D.]] in 1943.

== World War II ==
During [[World War II]], Selberg worked in isolation due to the [[German occupation of Norway]]. After the war his accomplishments became known, including a proof that a positive proportion of the zeros of the [[Riemann zeta function]] lie on the line &lt;math&gt;\Re(s)=\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. 
 
After the war, he turned to [[sieve theory]], a previously neglected topic which Selberg's work brought into prominence. In a 1947 paper he introduced the [[Selberg sieve]], a method well adapted in particular to providing auxiliary upper bounds, and which contributed to [[Chen's theorem]], among other important results. 

In March 1948, Selberg established, by elementary means, the asymptotic formula
:&lt;math&gt;\vartheta \left( x \right)\log \left( x \right) + \sum\limits_{p \le x} {\log \left( p \right)} \vartheta \left( {\frac{x}{p}} \right) = 2x\log \left( x \right) + O\left( x \right)&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;\vartheta \left( x \right) = \sum\limits_{p \le x} {\log \left( p \right)}&lt;/math&gt;
for primes &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. By July of that year, Selberg and [[Paul Erdős]] had each obtained [[elementary proof]]s of the [[prime number theorem]], both using Selberg's then unpublished asymptotic formula as a starting point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Spencer, Joel|author2=Graham, Ronald|title=The Elementary Proof of the Prime Number Theorem|journal=The Mathematical Intelligencer|year=2009|volume=31|issue=3|pages=18–23|url=http://www.cs.nyu.edu/spencer/erdosselberg.pdf|doi=10.1007/s00283-009-9063-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circumstances leading up to the proofs, as well as publication disagreements, led to a bitter dispute between the two mathematicians.&lt;ref name=goldfeld&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Goldfeld | first = Dorian | year = 2003 | title = The Elementary Proof of the Prime Number Theorem: an Historical Perspective | journal = Number Theory: New York Seminar | pages = 179–192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.ams.org/bull/2008-45-04/S0273-0979-08-01223-8/S0273-0979-08-01223-8.pdf |first=Nils A.|last= Baas|first2= Christian F.|last2= Skau |journal= Bull.

Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For his fundamental accomplishments during the 1940s, Selberg received the 1950 [[Fields Medal]].

== Institute for Advanced Study ==
Selberg moved to the [[United States]] and settled at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] in the 1950s where he remained until his death. During the 1950s he worked on introducing [[spectral theory]] into [[number theory]], culminating in his development of the [[Selberg trace formula]], the most famous and influential of his results. In its simplest form, this establishes a duality between the lengths of [[closed geodesic]]s on a [[compact Riemann surface]] and the [[eigenvalue]]s of the [[Laplace-Beltrami operator|Laplacian]], which is analogous to the duality between the [[prime number]]s and the zeros of the zeta function.

He was awarded the 1986 [[Wolf Prize in Mathematics]]. He was also awarded an honorary [[Abel Prize]] in 2002, its founding year, before the awarding of the regular prizes began.

Selberg received many distinctions for his work in addition to the [[Fields Medal]], the [[Wolf Prize]] and the [[Gunnerus Medal]]. He was elected to the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]], the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]] and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

Selberg had two children, Ingrid Selberg and Lars Selberg. Ingrid Selberg is married to playwright [[Mustapha Matura]].

He died at home in Princeton on 6 August 2007 of heart failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Atle Selberg, 90, Lauded Mathematician, Dies |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=2007-08-17|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/17/nyregion/17selberg.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
