The '''Brisbane Broncos''' are an Australian professional [[rugby league football]] club based in the city of [[Brisbane]], the capital of the state of [[Queensland]]. Founded in 1988, the Broncos play in Australasia's elite competition, the [[National Rugby League]] (NRL) premiership. They have won six premierships and two [[World Club Challenge]]s. The Broncos have achieved four [[minor premiership]]s during their 22 years in competition, making them the League's most successful club over the past two decades. Brisbane have never been defeated in a [[grand final]], and between 1991 and 2009, never failed to qualify for the finals. They are the most successful club since the National Rugby League began in 1998, winning a record three premierships in this era. They are also one of the most successful club in the history of Rugby League, having won 63% of their games since their induction in 1988, second only to Melbourne Storm with 64%. Broncos are by far one of the most known Rugby League club's in the world, And arguably the Biggest club in Rugby league.
The club records the highest annual revenue out of all NRL clubs – $32.8m for the 2012 financial year – and is one of the most valuable club of any code in Australia worth over $42 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The club was founded in 1988 as part of the [[Winfield Cup]]'s national expansion, becoming, along with the [[Gold Coast-Tweed Giants]], one of Queensland's first two participants in the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership]]. The Broncos later became a dominant force in the competition before playing a significant role in the [[Super League War]] of the mid-1990s, then continuing to compete successfully in the reunified National Rugby League competition. The Broncos are based in the Brisbane suburb of [[Red Hill, Queensland|Red Hill]] where their training ground and Leagues club are located, but they play their home games at [[Milton, Queensland|Milton]]'s [[Suncorp Stadium]]. They are the only publicly listed sporting club on the [[Australian Securities Exchange]], trading as Brisbane Broncos Limited ({{asx|BBL}}).

==History==
{{Main|History of the Brisbane Broncos}}
Queensland's success in the 1980s, the early years of the [[State of Origin series]] between [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] and [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]], in addition to the inclusion of a combined [[Brisbane Rugby League]] team in the [[Amco Cup|mid-week competition]], convinced the [[New South Wales Rugby League]] (NSWRL) to invite a Queensland-based team into the competition.&lt;ref name = &quot;broncshistory&quot;/&gt; After tough competition between the various syndicates for the Brisbane license, the [[Queensland Rugby League]] chose the bid of former [[Brisbane Rugby League]] (BRL) players, [[Barry Maranta]] and [[Paul Morgan (rugby league)|Paul &quot;Porky&quot; Morgan]].&lt;ref name = &quot;broncshistory&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Darren Lockyer cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Darren Lockyer]] playing for the Broncos in 2004. Lockyer made his Broncos debut in 1995 and was the former captain of the Broncos.]]
The Broncos secured the services of [[Australian Kangaroos]] captain [[Wally Lewis]] and former [[Brisbane Rugby League|BRL]] coach [[Wayne Bennett (rugby league)|Wayne Bennett]].&lt;ref name = &quot;broncshistory&quot;/&gt; The team made their debut in the NSWRL's [[1988 Winfield Cup]] premiership against reigning premiers, the [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]], and defeated them 44–10. However after this promising start they failed to make the finals. In their [[1989 Brisbane Broncos season|second season]] they won the mid-week knockout competition, the [[1989 Panasonic Cup (rugby league)|1989 Panasonic Cup]]. The club first tasted [[1992 Brisbane Broncos season#Grand final|premiership success in 1992]], and [[1993 Brisbane Broncos season#Grand final|again in 1993]], defeating the [[St. George Dragons]] in both years.&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Pramberg, Bernie and Malone, Paul and Colman, Mike and Dick, Barry| title= Broncos: 20 Fabulous Years | publisher={{sic|Play|right|hide=y}} Publishing Pty Ltd | year=2007| isbn=0-9775226-4-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brisbane Broncos 1995|1995]], the [[Super League War]] broke out.  After threats of expulsion from the NSWRL, the Broncos were one of the last clubs to sign with the new league and all players followed suit (The Canberra Raiders, Canterbury Bulldogs and Cronulla Sharks were the first to sign, and it was only revealed many years later that the Broncos were in fact one of the last clubs to sign for either competition).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/League/League-apart/2005/03/25/1111692629384.html League apart – League]. www.smh.com.au. Retrieved on 20 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Broncos CEO [[John Ribot]] moved to take over the running of the rebel [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]], leading to a perception that the conflict was orchestrated by the club.&lt;ref name=&quot;broncshistory&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Whiticker, Alan &amp; Collis, Ian | title= The History of Rugby League Clubs| publisher=New Holland Publishers (Australia) Pty Ltd | year=2004| isbn=1-74110-075-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;broncs1908&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Brisbane Broncos History RL1908 |url=http://www.rl1908.com/Clubs/Brisbane-Broncos.htm | accessdate=6 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brisbane won the only [[Super League (Australia) season 1997|Super League premiership]] in [[Brisbane Broncos 1997|1997]], before winning the first National Rugby League trophy in the re-unified [[Brisbane Broncos 1998|1998]] competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot;/&gt;

[[Brisbane Broncos 1999|1999]] was disappointing for the club with a terrible early-season form hindering their attempt at a third consecutive premiership losing 8 of their first 10 matches. Club legend [[Allan Langer]] retired mid-season, perhaps as a result of the team's form. Despite the club's mid-season turnaround, which resulted in qualification for the finals after an 11-match winning streak, the team was eliminated by the [[Cronulla Sharks]] in the first week of the finals.  However, the Broncos' rebounded in 2000 with their fifth premiership, defeating the [[Sydney Roosters]]. The game marked the retirement of veterans [[Kevin Walters]] and [[Michael Hancock (rugby league)|Michael Hancock]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:NRL Grand Final 2006.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The 2006 Grand final at [[Stadium Australia]].]]
Allan Langer returned to the club in [[Brisbane Broncos 2002|2002]] for one season before eventually retiring. 2002 was also the beginning of Brisbane's &quot;post-Origin slump&quot;, which has haunted the club in the years since. Many players represent [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] in the [[State of Origin series]], with 7 Broncos players on average included in the Queensland Origin team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Brisbane Broncos – Representative Players|url=http://www.broncos.com.au/index.cfm?MenuID=330&amp;TopMenuID=266| accessdate=21 April 2007}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; This extra workload has caused a loss of form for the club immediately after the series, evidenced in 2003 when the ladder-leading Broncos lost 10 of their last 11 games.  Despite faring better in [[Brisbane Broncos 2004|2004]] and [[Brisbane Broncos 2005|2005]], the team still struggled in the latter stages of the season, losing all of their finals matches.&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot;/&gt;

In [[Brisbane Broncos 2006|2006]], after a strong early and mid-season performance, the Broncos again entered the post-Origin slump, losing 5 consecutive games. However, they reversed this run of form, winning 6 of their last 7 games including the [[2006 NRL Grand Final|premiership decider]] against the [[Melbourne Storm]] and keeping their perfect Grand Final record intact.
&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot;/&gt; After a dismal 2007 season in which they only scraped into the finals, coach Wayne Bennett announced he would leave at the end of 2008 after twenty-one years as coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Fox Sports|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,23162743-23214,00.html|title=Bennett tells players he's leaving|date=5 February 2008|accessdate=5 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ivan Henjak]], a former rugby league player who had been assistant coach with the Broncos since the beginning of 2006, was named their second-ever coach, commencing as coach for the 2009 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/04/19/2221586.htm|publisher=''[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]''|title=Henjak name Broncos coach|date=19 April 2008|accessdate=19 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their 2009 season included their worst-ever post-Origin slump, featuring three matches in a row where the opposing team scored more than 40 points, concluding with a 56–0 loss to Canberra on 1 August 2009. They rallied around and in their match against Penrith two rounds later, they won 58–24. This snapback (after Penrith, they won the rest of their games that season) got them into the finals for the 18th year running, but they fell against Melbourne in the 3rd preliminary final by 40–10.

Their 2010 season started moderately: a 30–24 win against North Queensland, a 14–22 loss to Canberra, and a 48–16 hammering by the Warriors on 28 March 2010. On Monday 29 March, former Broncos player and recruitment agent Allan Langer was caught drink-driving in Brisbane's northside.&lt;ref&gt;The Courier-Mail, 30 March 2010 and various other sources.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from a late season 10–6 win against eventual premiers [[St. George Illawarra Dragons|St George Illawarra]], the 2010 season was one to forget; with injuries and poor form seeing the Broncos out of the finals for the first time since 1991. The Broncos missing the finals now means that every club has missed the finals at least once since the 2002 season.

In February 2011, it was announced that [[Ivan Henjak]] was to be sacked from the club, only three weeks before the beginning of the season. [[Anthony Griffin (rugby league)|Anthony Griffin]] took over as coach for the 2011 season,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/02/21/3144713.htm|publisher=''[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]''|title=Broncos sack coack Henjak|date=21 February 2011|accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming just the third head coach in the history of the Brisbane Broncos. He led the club to a third place finish at the end of the season, losing to eventual premiers [[Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles|Manly]] in the preliminary finals.

2012 marked the Broncos' 25th season in the NRL competition. They finished eighth on the premiership ladder, and were knocked out of the finals in the first week, losing 33–16 to the [[North Queensland Cowboys]] in Townsville. 2013 saw the Broncos finish 12th on the NRL ladder, marking its lowest ever finish in the club's history and seeing the club out of the finals for only the second time since 1991.

As of 2014, the Broncos are currently experiencing their longest premiership drought, having endured eight completed seasons without winning the premiership since their most recent success in [[2006 Brisbane Broncos season|2006]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broncos.com.au/news-display/Broncos-To-Be-A-Title-Force-In-2014/86826 Broncos To Be A Title Force in 2014], ''Brisbane Broncos Official Website'', 4 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emblem and colours==
[[Image:brisbane 1988.jpg|thumb|150px|The club's original logo, used from 1988 to 1999.]]It had originally been planned for the Brisbane Broncos to adopt a logo incorporating both a [[kangaroo]] and a stylised &quot;Q&quot; which had been featured in the logo for the Queensland Rugby League for many years. However, with the [[Australian national rugby league team]] also known as the Kangaroos, this was deemed inappropriate and conflicting. The state flower the [[Cooktown Orchid]] and the [[Poinsettia]] which had long been used by Brisbane representative teams in the [[Bulimba Cup (rugby league competition)|Bulimba Cup]] and midweek knockout competitions was also ruled out, along with other [[Fauna of Australia|Australian animals]] such as the [[brumby]], [[possum]], [[galah]] and the [[kookaburra]], which was used on Brisbane's Kookaburra Queen [[Paddle steamer|paddleships]].

The original club logo was first featured in the Broncos' inaugural season in the premiership in 1988 and was used until 1999. It used a mostly gold colour scheme, in line with the predominant colour on the team jerseys. In 2000, the club adopted a new logo with a more maroon design, which was much closer to the traditional colour associated with Queensland rugby league and Queensland sport in general.&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot;/&gt; This design continues to be used to date.

Traditionally, the colours of the Brisbane Broncos have been maroon, white and gold, which have all long been linked to the history of rugby league in Queensland. Initially, the founders of the club favoured the official blue and gold colours of [[Brisbane City Council]]. However, Sydney advertiser [[John Singleton (Australian entrepreneur)|John Singleton]] advised the board that &quot;Queenslanders had been booing players wearing blue for more than three-quarters of a century.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;broncsteamtobeat&quot;/&gt; As a result, the traditional maroon and white colours of Queensland along with gold, symbolising the Queensland sunshine,
&lt;ref name=&quot;broncsteamtobeat&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Gallaway, Jack   | title=The Brisbane Broncos: The Team To Beat   | publisher=University of Queensland Press   | year=2002  | isbn=0-7022-3275-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; were adopted as the club's colours.

In the inaugural [[1988 Brisbane Broncos season|1988 season]], the club's jersey design featured the top third being gold, the middle being alternating hoops of maroon and white and the bottom third being maroon. Although this design featured gold strongly, it did not please everyone as the jersey had to differentiate from the maroon and white of [[Manly Sea Eagles|Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles]] and the maroon of the [[Queensland rugby league team]].&lt;ref name=&quot;broncs1908&quot;/&gt; Following a number of design changes in the 1990s including a predominantly white jersey from 1997 to 1998, blue was added to the jersey in 2001 as a minor colour to show the aforementioned historical link with the colours of Brisbane. However, this was later dropped from the design in favour of a mainly maroon jersey with gold trim.&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot;/&gt;

At the 1995 [[Rugby League World Sevens]] tournament, the club introduced a new combination of jersey colours – mauve, aqua and white. Brisbane Broncos Marketing Manager Shane Edwards stated that it &quot;will become our Sevens strip... but we will never change the Broncos' colours.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bronco! Magazine Issue 1, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, following the release of the club's predominantly white with navy-blue and maroon away jersey, the National Rugby League ordered the club to produce a third jersey since the new away jersey clashed with the home jerseys of the [[Penrith Panthers]], Melbourne Storm and [[New Zealand Warriors]]. An aqua strip using the same design as the jerseys used from 1999 to 2001 was worn, which was much derided by the local media. Following two years of public pressure the club dropped the jersey in favour of the design worn against Newcastle in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot;/&gt;

==Stadium==
{{Main|Brisbane Broncos Stadiums}}
[[Image:Suncorpstadium071006.JPG|thumb|250px|right|View of the current Brisbane Broncos home ground, Suncorp Stadium.]]
In their first five seasons, the Broncos played their matches at the 33,000 capacity [[Lang Park]], the ground considered to be the home of rugby league in Queensland. However, following ongoing conflict with the Queensland Rugby League and Lang Park Trust due to a sponsorship conflict (the QRL had a commercial agreement with [[Castlemaine XXXX]] brewery with prominent signs around the ground, while the Broncos were sponsored by rival brewery Powers), the team relocated to the 60,000 capacity [[Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre|ANZ Stadium]] in 1993 (ANZ had been the main stadium of the [[1982 Commonwealth Games]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;broncs1908&quot;/&gt; The club's home match attendance, which had averaged 19,637 at Lang Park, increased to 43,200 at the new ground in the first season following the club's first premiership title in the previous season.&lt;ref name = &quot;broncscrowd&quot;/&gt; However, despite the team's second premiership in 1993, crowds gradually declined and it was not until 2002 that the club again registered more than the 1996 average attendance of 23,712. ANZ Stadium, as the Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre was called at the time due to sponsorship rights, was featured on [[The Mole (Australia season 3)#Episode 8|an episode of ''The Mole'']] in April 2002.

With the Queensland Government's $280,000,000 redevelopment of Lang Park,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Suncorp Stadium Land Park Redevelopment |url=http://www.arup.com/australasia/project.cfm?pageid=1354 | accessdate=22 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the team moved back to the refurbished and renamed Suncorp Stadium upon its completion in mid-2003. The more centrally-located stadium has begun to attract larger crowds, with the 2006 average attendance of 31,208 being significantly higher than the [[Newcastle Knights]] with 21,848 and about double the regular season competition average of 15,601.&lt;ref name=&quot;broncscrowd&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Rugby League Tables / Attendances Brisbane |url=http://stats.rleague.com/rl/crowds/brisbane.html | accessdate=6 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club record attendance for a regular season match is 58,593, set against the St. George Dragons in the final round of the 1993 season. The record attendance for a match at Suncorp Stadium is 50,859 for Darren Lockyer's final home game. Before kick-off at the Stadium an instrumental version of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s &quot;[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]&quot; is routinely played.

The Broncos all-time home attendance record was set at ANZ Stadium during the [[1997 Super League (Australia) season#Grand final|1997 Super League Grand Final]] when 58,912 saw the Broncos defeat the [[Cronulla Sharks]] 26-8 to claim the only [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]] premiership played in Australia.

THEN MORE ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE

 --&gt;
[[John Ribot]], a former first grade rugby league player in Queensland and New South Wales, was the club's original chief executive officer (CEO). Ribot left when he signed to become the CEO of the rebel Australian rugby league competition [[Super League (Australia)|Super League]]. (p.&amp;nbsp;24,112) Shane Edwards, the Broncos Marketing Manager at the time, was promoted to CEO and later resigned. Bruno Cullen, who had been with the Broncos' off-field staff since 1989, became the club's third CEO in 2003.
&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--

THEN A PARAGRAPH ABOUT SPONSORS

 --&gt;

[[NRMA|NRMA Insurance]] are the major sponsors of the Broncos as of 2011, replacing [[WOW Sight &amp; Sound]]. [[Nova 106.9]] are the main radio sponsors after taking over from rival station [[B105 FM]] in late 2006. Live broadcasts of all Broncos matches are provided by both [[612 ABC Brisbane]] (except games played on Monday Night) and [[4MMM]]. [[QTQ|Channel Nine Queensland]] also sponsors the Broncos, although former player [[Shane Webcke]] is signed to rival [[BTQ|Seven Queensland]].

In 2012, local Brisbane based company Firstmac Home Loans replaced WOW sight &amp; Sound as sleeve sponsor for 3 years to launch into the retail financial services market. This sponsorship took only 9 days to negotiate following the announcement of WOW Sight &amp; Sound going into receivership. Firstmac stipulated a unique clause in their contract that they could pay for 250 tickets to be distributed to WOW Sight &amp; Sound staff that lost their jobs. Firstmac has since launched a Firstmac Broncos home loan in conjunction with their new sponsorship agreement.

The club's apparel is manufactured by [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carltonfc.com.au/news/2013-05-22/the-president-pays-a-visit-to-nike The President pays a visit to Nike], ''CARLTONFC.com.au'', 22 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the club's premiership success and its being the dominant Queensland team in the competition for the majority of its participation, the Brisbane Broncos' list of representative players is extensive. Consequently, there have been a large number of Queensland Maroons in the team. In 2007, a 20-man legends team was announced to celebrate the club's 20-year anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Broncos Name Legends Team | url=http://www.nrl.com/News/Latest/NewsArticle/tabid/76/NewsId/5007/Default.aspx | accessdate=9 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics and records==
{{details|Brisbane Broncos Records}}
The Brisbane Broncos are the second most successful club in terms of percentage of total games won, having won 63.63% of their games, as of 29 August 2012. This is marginally less (0.01%) than first placed [[Melbourne Storm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Rugby League Tables / Win-Loss Records / All Teams | url=http://www.stats.rleague.com/rl/teams/all/overall_wl.html | accessdate=22 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their twenty completed seasons, the club has made a total of six Grand Finals, winning each time. They are one of only two clubs to have won the [[World Club Challenge]] twice, and were the first club to do so on British soil. They also won the now defunct [[Amco Cup|Panasonic Cup]] in [[1989 Panasonic Cup (rugby league)|1989]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fabulous&quot;/&gt;

Former team captain Darren Lockyer holds the record for the most First Grade games for both the club and National League. Lockyer also holds the record for the most points scored for the club, tallying 1,171 since his debut in 1995, and the club record of 272 points in a season, having achieved this in 1998. [[Steve Renouf]] holds the record for the most career tries for the club with 142. Renouf also shares the club record for the most number of tries in a season with [[Darren Smith (rugby league)|Darren Smith]] at 23. [[Lote Tuqiri]]'s tally of 26 points from three tries and seven goals in a single match against the [[Northern Eagles]] remains the club record for most individual points in a game.&lt;ref name = &quot;broncsrecords&quot;/&gt; [[Corey Parker (rugby league)|Corey Parker]] holds the record for most goals in a game kicking ten in a round one clash of 2008, breaking the previous mark of nine kicked by Lockyer in 1998 and matched by [[Michael De Vere]] in 2001. Parker converted ten from ten goals in the Broncos 48–12 win over the [[Penrith Panthers]] in which Parker scored 24 points placing him in equal second place on the most points in a match tally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/lockyer-gets-rousing-welcome-from-fans/20080316-1zqx.html|title=Lockyer gets rousing welcome from fans|date=16 March 2008|accessdate=16 March 2008 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | first=Wayne | last=Heming}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six players have scored four tries in a match for the Brisbane Broncos including [[Steve Renouf]], [[Wendell Sailor]], [[Karmichael Hunt]], [[Justin Hodges]], [[Denan Kemp]] and [[Israel Folau]].&lt;ref name=&quot;broncsrecords&quot;&gt;2006 Official Rugby League Annual.
