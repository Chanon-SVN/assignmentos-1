The '''Association for Computing Machinery''' ('''ACM''') is a U.S.-based international [[learned society]] for [[computing]]. It was founded in 1947 and is the world's largest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.iu.edu/news/page/normal/20613.html |title=Indiana University Media Relations |publisher=indiana.edu |accessdate=2012&amp;ndash;10&amp;ndash;02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; scientific and educational [[computing]] society. It is a not-for-profit professional membership group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/pub78Search.do?ein1=&amp;names=%22association+for+computing+machinery%22&amp;city=&amp;state=All...&amp;country=US&amp;deductibility=all&amp;dispatchMethod=searchCharities&amp;submitName=Search |title=ACM 501(c)3 Status as a group |publisher=irs.gov |accessdate=2012&amp;ndash;10&amp;ndash;01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its membership is more than 100,000 as of 2011.  Its headquarters are in New York City.

The ACM and the [[IEEE Computer Society]] are the umbrella organizations for US academic and scholarly interests in computing. Unlike the [[IEEE]], the ACM is solely dedicated to computing.

==Activities==
[[File:Twopennplaza.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Street view of top half of skyscraper against the sky; its outside is dominated by vertical black and white lines|Two Penn Plaza site of the ACM headquarters in New York City]]
ACM is organized into over 170 local chapters and 35 [[Special Interest Group]]s (SIGs), through which it conducts most of its activities. Additionally, there are over 500 college and university chapters. The first student chapter was founded in 1961 at the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]].

Many of the SIGs, like [[ACM SIGGRAPH|SIGGRAPH]], [[SIGPLAN]], [[SIGCSE]] and [[SIGCOMM]], sponsor regular conferences which have become famous as the dominant venue for presenting innovations in certain fields. The groups also publish a large number of specialized journals, magazines, and newsletters.

ACM also sponsors other computer science related events such as the worldwide [[ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest]] (ICPC), and has sponsored some other events such as the chess match between [[Garry Kasparov]] and the [[IBM Deep Blue]] computer.

==Services==
ACM Press publishes a prestigious{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} academic journal,
''[[Journal of the ACM]]'', and general magazines for computer professionals, ''[[Communications of the ACM]]'' (also known as ''Communications'' or ''CACM'') and ''[[ACM Queue|Queue]]''. Other publications of the ACM include:
*''[[XRDS (magazine)|ACM XRDS]]'', formerly &quot;Crossroads&quot;, was designed in 2010 and is the most popular student computing magazine in the US.
*''[[ACM Interactions (magazine)|ACM Interactions]]'', an interdisciplinary HCI publication focused on the connections between experiences, people and technology, and the third largest ACM publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1145/1897239.1897240}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[ACM Computing Surveys]]'' (CSUR)
*''ACM Computers in Entertainment'' (CIE)
*A number of journals, specific to subfields of computer science, titled ''ACM Transactions''. Some of the more notable transactions include:
**''ACM Transactions on Computer Systems'' (TOCS)
**''[[IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics]]'' (TCBB)
**''[[ACM Transactions on Computational Logic]]'' (TOCL)
**''[[ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction]]'' (TOCHI)
**''[[ACM Transactions on Database Systems]]'' (TODS)
**''[[ACM Transactions on Graphics]]'' (TOG)
**''[[ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software]]'' (TOMS)
**''[[ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications, and Applications]]'' (TOMCCAP)
**''[[IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking]]'' (TON)
**''[[ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems]]'' (TOPLAS)

Although ''Communications'' no longer publishes primary research, and is not considered a prestigious venue, many of the great debates and results in computing history have been published in its pages.

ACM has made almost all of its publications available to paid [[subscriber]]s online at its [[#Digital Library|Digital Library]] and also has a [[ACM Guide to Computing Literature|Guide to Computing Literature]]. Individual members additionally have access to [[Safari Books Online]] and Books24x7. The ACM also offers insurance, online courses, and other services to its members.

==Digital Library==
The ACM [[Digital Library]] contains a comprehensive archive starting in the 1950s of the organization's journals, magazines, newsletters and conference proceedings. Online services include a forum called Ubiquity and Tech News digest. There is an extensive underlying bibliographic database containing key works of all genres from all major publishers of computing literature. This secondary database is a rich discovery service known as The ACM Guide to Computing Literature.

ACM adopted a hybrid [[OA publishing]] model in 2013. Authors who do not choose to pay the OA fee must grant ACM publishing rights by either a copyright transfer agreement or a publishing license agreement. See.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://authors.acm.org/ | title=ACM Author Rights |publisher=Acm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACM was a &quot;green&quot; publisher before the term was invented. Authors may post documents on their own websites and in their institutional repositories with a link back to the ACM Digital Library's permanently maintained Version of Record.

All metadata in the Digital Library is open to the world, including [[abstracts]], linked references and citing works, citation and usage statistics, as well as all functionality and services. Other than the free articles, the full-texts are accessed by subscription.

==Competition==
ACM's primary historical competitor has been the [[IEEE Computer Society]], which is the largest subgroup of the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]]. The IEEE focuses more on hardware and standardization issues than theoretical [[computer science]], but there is considerable overlap with ACM's agenda. They occasionally cooperate on projects like developing computing curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acm.org/education/education/curric_vols/CC2005&amp;ndash;March06Final.pdf |title=Computing Curricula 2005: The Overview Report|author-separator=, |author1 = Joint Task Force of Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)|author2 = Association for Information Systems|authorlink2=Association for Information Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the major awards in [[Computer science]] are given jointly by ACM and the [[IEEE Computer Society|IEEE&amp;ndash;CS]].&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Ken Kennedy Award]]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a mounting challenge to the ACM's publication practices coming from the [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] movement. Some authors see a centralized peer&amp;ndash;review process as less relevant and publish on their home pages or on unreviewed sites like [[arXiv]]. Other organizations have sprung up which do their peer review entirely free and online, such as [[Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research|Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR)]], [[Journal of Machine Learning Research|Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR)]] and the Journal of Research and Practice in Information Technology.

==Membership grades==
In addition to student and regular members, ACM has several advanced membership grades to recognize those with multiple years of membership and &quot;demonstrated performance that sets them apart from their peers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acm.org/membership/membership/senior_members/ |title=ACM Senior Members&amp;ndash;An Overview |publisher=Acm.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fellows===
{{See also|Category:Fellows of the Association for Computing Machinery}}
The '''ACM Fellows Program''' was established by Council of the Association for Computing Machinery in 1993 &quot;to recognize and honor outstanding ACM members for their achievements in computer science and information technology and for their significant contributions to the mission of the ACM.&quot;

There are presently about 500 Fellows&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fellows.acm.org/ |title=List of ACM Fellows |publisher=Fellows.acm.org |accessdate=2012&amp;ndash;06&amp;ndash;07}}&lt;/ref&gt; out of about 60,000 professional members.{{as of?|date=June 2014}}

===Distinguished Members===
In 2006 ACM began recognizing two additional membership grades, one which was called Distinguished Members. Distinguished Members (Distinguished Engineers, Distinguished Scientists, and Distinguished Educators) have at least 15 years of professional experience and 5 years of continuous ACM membership and &quot;have made a significant impact on the computing field&quot;. Note that in 2006 when the Distinguished Members first came out, one of the three levels was called &quot;Distinguished Member&quot; and was changed about two years later to &quot;Distinguished Educator&quot;. Those who already had the Distinguished Member title had their titles changed to one of the other three titles.

===Senior Members===
Also in 2006, ACM began recognizing Senior Members. Senior Members have ten or more years of professional experience and 5 years of continuous ACM membership.

==Chapters==
ACM has three kinds of chapters: [[Special Interest Group]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.acm.org/sigs | title=ACM Special Interest Groups | accessdate=August 7, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100727190450/http://www.acm.org/sigs| archivedate= July 27, 2010 &lt;!&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;DASHBot&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional Chapters, and Student Chapters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.acm.org/chapters/ | title=ACM Chapters | accessdate=August 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
The President of the ACM for 2014–2016 is [[Alexander L. Wolf]] of [[Imperial College London]], UK. He is the successor of [[Vint Cerf]] (2012–2014), an American computer scientist who is recognized as one of &quot;the fathers of the Internet&quot;; Alain Chesnais (2010–2012), a French citizen living in [[Toronto]], Canada, where he runs his company named Visual Transitions; and [[Wendy Hall|Dame Wendy Hall]] of the [[University of Southampton]], UK (2008-2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acm.org/about/past-presidents |title=ACM Past Presidents |publisher=acm.org |accessdate=2014-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ACM is led by a Council consisting of the President, Vice&amp;ndash;President, Treasurer, Past President, SIG Governing Board Chair, Publications Board Chair, three representatives of the SIG Governing Board, and seven Members&amp;ndash;At&amp;ndash;Large. This institution is often referred to simply as &quot;Council&quot; in ''Communications of the ACM''.

==Infrastructure==
ACM has five “Boards” that make up various committees and subgroups, to help Headquarters staff maintain quality services and products. These boards are as follows:
# Publications Board
# SIG Governing Board
# Education Board
# Membership Services Board
# Practioners Board

==ACM–W: Association for Computing Machinery Council on Women in Computing==
ACM&amp;ndash;W,&lt;ref&gt;[http://women.acm.org/ women.acm.org]&lt;/ref&gt;  the ACM's council on [[women in computing]], supports, celebrates, and advocates internationally for the full engagement of women in computing. ACM–W's main programs are regional celebrations of women in computing, ACM-W chapters, and scholarships for women CS students to attend research conferences. In India and Europe these activities are overseen by ACM-W India and ACM-W Europe respectively.  ACM-W collaborates with organizations such as the Anita Borg Institute, the National Center for Women and IT, CRA-W.

===Athena Lectures===
The ACM-W gives an annual Athena Lecturer Award to honor outstanding women researchers who have made fundamental contributions to computer science.  This program began in 2006. Speakers are nominated by SIG officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
