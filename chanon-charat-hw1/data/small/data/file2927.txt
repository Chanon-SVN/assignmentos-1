{{See also|Evolution of cetaceans}}
Blue whales are [[rorquals]] (family [[Balaenopteridae]]), a family that includes the [[humpback whale]], the [[fin whale]], [[Bryde's whale]], the [[sei whale]], and the [[minke whale]].&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheet&quot; /&gt; The family [[Balaenopteridae]] is believed to have diverged from the other families of the suborder [[Mysticeti]] as long ago as the middle [[Oligocene]] (28 [[Year#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]] ago). It is not known when the members of those families diverged from each other.

The blue whale is usually classified as one of eight species in the genus ''Balaenoptera''; one authority places it in a separate monotypic genus, ''Sibbaldus'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Other common names for the blue whale have included '''Sibbald's rorqual''' (after Sibbald, who first described the species), the '''great blue whale''' and the '''great northern rorqual'''. These names have now fallen into disuse. The first known usage of the term '''blue whale''' was in Melville's ''Moby-Dick'', which only mentions it in passing and does not specifically attribute it to the species in question. The name was really derived from the Norwegian '''blåhval''', coined by [[Svend Foyn]] shortly after he had perfected the harpoon gun; the Norwegian scientist [[Georg Ossian Sars|G. O.

Authorities classify the species into three or four subspecies: ''B. m. musculus'', the northern blue whale consisting of the North Atlantic and North Pacific populations, ''B. m. intermedia'', the southern blue whale of the [[Southern Ocean]], ''B. m. brevicauda'', the [[pygmy blue whale]] found in the Indian Ocean and South Pacific,&lt;ref&gt;Ichihara T.

The pygmy blue whale ''B. m. brevicauda'', a new subspecies from the Antarctic in ''Whales, dolphins and porpoises'' Page(s) 79–113.&lt;/ref&gt; and the more problematic ''B. m. indica'', the great Indian rorqual, which is also found in the Indian Ocean and, although described earlier, may be the same subspecies as ''B. m. brevicauda''.&lt;ref name=msw3/&gt;

==Description and behaviour==
[[Image:Blue whale tail.JPG|thumb|right|A blue whale lifting its tail flukes]]
[[Image:Blue Whale 001 body bw.jpg|thumb|right|Adult blue whale]]
The blue whale has a long tapering body that appears stretched in comparison with the stockier build of other whales.&lt;ref name=&quot;des&quot; /&gt; The head is flat, ''U''-shaped and has a prominent ridge running from the [[Blowhole (biology)|blowhole]] to the top of the upper lip.&lt;ref name=&quot;des&quot; /&gt; The front part of the mouth is thick with [[baleen]] plates; around 300 plates (each around one metre (3.2&amp;nbsp;ft) long)&lt;ref name=&quot;des&quot; /&gt; hang from the upper jaw, running {{convert|0.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} back into the mouth. Between 70 and 118 grooves (called ventral pleats) run along the throat parallel to the body length. These pleats assist with evacuating water from the mouth after lunge feeding (see [[Blue whale#Feeding|feeding]] below).

The [[dorsal fin]] is small,&lt;ref name=&quot;des&quot; /&gt; ranging in height from {{convert|8|-|70|cm|in|sp=us}} (usually {{convert|20|-|40|cm|in|sp=us}}) and averaging about {{convert|28|cm}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacWheel1929&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is visible only briefly during the dive sequence. Located around three-quarters of the way along the length of the body, it varies in shape from one individual to another; some only have a barely perceptible lump, but others may have prominent and falcate (sickle-shaped) dorsals. When surfacing to breathe, the blue whale raises its shoulder and blowhole out of the water to a greater extent than other large whales, such as the fin or sei whales. Observers can use this trait to differentiate between species at sea. Some blue whales in the North Atlantic and North Pacific raise their tail fluke when diving. When breathing, the whale emits a spectacular vertical single-column spout up to {{convert|12|m|ft}}, typically {{convert|9|m|ft}}. Its [[lung]] capacity is 5,000&amp;nbsp;litres (1320 U.S. gallons). Blue whales have twin blowholes shielded by a large splashguard.&lt;ref name=&quot;des&quot; /&gt;

The flippers are {{convert|3|-|4|m|ft}} long. The upper sides are grey with a thin white border; the lower sides are white. The head and tail fluke are generally uniformly grey. The whale's upper parts, and sometimes the flippers, are usually mottled. The degree of mottling varies substantially from individual to individual. Some may have a uniform slate-grey color, but others demonstrate a considerable variation of dark blues, greys and blacks, all tightly mottled.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheet&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Blue whales can reach speeds of {{convert|50|km/h|mph}} over short bursts, usually when interacting with other whales, but {{convert|20|km/h|mph}} is a more typical traveling speed.&lt;ref name=&quot;factsheet&quot; /&gt; When feeding, they slow down to {{convert|5|km/h|mph}}.

Blue whales most commonly live alone or with one other individual. It is not known how long traveling pairs stay together. In locations where there is a high concentration of food, as many as 50 blue whales have been seen scattered over a small area. They do not form the large, close-knit groups seen in other baleen species.

Blue whales are difficult to weigh because of their size. As is the case with most large whales targeted by whalers, adult blue whales have never been weighed whole, but cut up into manageable pieces first. This caused an underestimate of the total weight of the whale, due to the loss of blood and other fluids. As a whole, blue whales from the Northern Atlantic and Pacific appear to be smaller on average than those from sub-Antarctic waters. Nevertheless, measurements between {{convert|150|-|170|tonne|short ton}} were recorded of animals up to {{convert|27|m|ft}} in length. The weight of an individual {{convert|30|m|ft}} long is believed by the American [[National Marine Mammal Laboratory]] (NMML) to be in excess of {{convert|180|tonne|short ton}}.

Because krill move, blue whales typically feed at depths of more than {{convert|100|m|ft}} during the day and only surface-feed at night. Dive times are typically 10&amp;nbsp;minutes when feeding, though dives of up to 21&amp;nbsp;minutes are possible. The whale feeds by lunging forward at groups of krill, taking the animals and a large quantity of water into its mouth. The water is then squeezed out through the baleen plates by pressure from the ventral pouch and tongue. Once the mouth is clear of water, the remaining krill, unable to pass through the plates, are swallowed. The blue whale also incidentally consumes small fish, crustaceans and squid caught up with krill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

As with other mammals, the fundamental instinct of the whale was to try to carry on breathing at all costs, even though this meant beaching to prevent itself from drowning. Two of the whale's bones were erected just off a main road on Lewis and remain a tourist attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Blue whale calls last between ten and thirty seconds. Blue whales off the coast of [[Sri Lanka]] have been repeatedly recorded making &quot;songs&quot; of four notes, lasting about two minutes each, reminiscent of the well-known humpback whale songs. As this phenomenon has not been seen in any other populations, researchers believe it may be unique to the ''B. m. brevicauda'' (pygmy) subspecies.

Blue whales are not easy to catch or kill. Their speed and power meant that they were rarely pursued by early whalers, who instead targeted [[Sperm whale|sperm]] and [[right whale]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Because of disputes with the local fishermen, the last whaling station in Finnmark was closed down in 1904.

Soon, blue whales were being hunted off Iceland (1883), the Faroe Islands (1894), [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] (1898), and [[Spitsbergen]] (1903). In 1904–05 the first blue whales were taken off [[South Georgia]]. By 1925, with the advent of the stern slipway in factory ships and the use of steam-driven whale catchers, the catch of blue whales, and baleen whales as a whole, in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic began to increase dramatically. In the 1930–31 season, these ships caught 29,400 blue whales in the Antarctic alone. By the end of [[World War II]], populations had been significantly depleted, and, in 1946, the first quotas restricting international trade in whales were introduced, but they were ineffective because of the lack of differentiation between species. Rare species could be hunted on an equal footing with those found in relative abundance.

[[Arthur C. Clarke]], in his 1962 book ''Profiles of the Future'', was the first prominent [[intellectual]] to call attention to the plight of the blue whale. He mentioned its large brain and said, &quot;we do not know the true nature of the entity we are destroying.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur C. Clarke|Clarke, Arthur C.]] ''Profiles of the Future; an Inquiry into the Limits of the Possible''. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the introduction of the whaling ban, studies have examined whether the [[conservation reliant species|conservation reliant]] global blue whale population is increasing or remaining stable. In the Antarctic, best estimates show an increase of 7.3% per year since the end of illegal Soviet whaling, but numbers remain at under 1% of their original levels.&lt;ref name=Ant/&gt; According to a 2014 study, the Californian Blue Whale population has rebounded to an estimated 97% of its pre-hunting population.&lt;ref&gt;Hines, Sandra (September 5, 2014) &quot;[http://www.washington.edu/news/2014/09/05/california-blue-whales-rebound-from-whaling-first-of-their-kin-to-do-so/ California blue whales rebound from whaling; first of their kin to do so]&quot;, University of Washington&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest known concentration, consisting of about 2,800 individuals, is the northeast Pacific population of the northern blue whale (''B. m. musculus'') subspecies that ranges from [[Alaska]] to [[Costa Rica]], but is most commonly seen from California in summer.&lt;ref&gt;Blue Whale (''Balaenoptera musculus''): Eastern North Pacific Stock (''NOAA Stock Reports'', 2009), p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Infrequently, this population visits the northwest Pacific between [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] and the northern tip of Japan.

====North Atlantic====
In the North Atlantic, two stocks of ''B. m. musculus'' are recognised. The first is found off [[Greenland]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], Nova Scotia and the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]]. This group is estimated to total about 500. The second, more easterly group is spotted from the [[Azores]] in spring to Iceland in July and August; it is presumed the whales follow the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] between the two volcanic islands. Beyond Iceland, blue whales have been spotted as far north as [[Spitsbergen]] and [[Jan Mayen]], though such sightings are rare. Scientists do not know where these whales spend their winters. The total North Atlantic population is estimated to be between 600 and 1,500. Off [[Ireland]], the first ever confirmed sightings were made in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildlifeextra.com/go/news/ireland-blue-whales723.html#cr|title=Wildlife Extra News - Blue whales sighted off Irish coast|author=Powell Ettinger|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; since then [[Porcupine Seabight]] has been regarded as a prominent habitat for the species along with Fin Whales.

====North Pacific====

The Californian population seems to be recolonizing slowly in the former habitats off [[British Columbia]] and in the [[Gulf of Alaska]]. As the population grows, whales in this population seem to be adapting more to near-shore waters and to human vessels.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Almost nothing is known about the central and western populations. Of the populations that once existed off coastal Japan, the last recorded confirmed stranding was in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Yamada T., Watanabe Y.|title=Marine Mammals Stranding DataBase - Blue Whale|url=http://svrsh2.kahaku.go.jp/drift/e/FMPro?-db=rec2000web.fp5&amp;-format=%2fdrift%2fe%2fresults.htm&amp;-lay=hp&amp;-sortfield=%90%bc%97%ef%94%4e%8c%8e%93%fa&amp;sp%5fid=14&amp;-format=/drift/e/detail.htm&amp;-skip=3&amp;-max=1&amp;-find|publisher=The [[National Museum of Nature and Science]]|accessdate=2015-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scientists regard that historical populations off Japan were driven to extinction by whaling activities, mostly from the Kumanonada Sea off [[Wakayama]], in Tosa Bay, and in the [[Sea of Hyūga]].

====Southern Hemisphere====
In the Southern Hemisphere, there appear to be two distinct subspecies, ''B. m. intermedia'', the Antarctic blue whale, and the little-studied pygmy blue whale, ''B. m. brevicauda'', found in Indian Ocean waters. The most recent surveys (midpoint 1998) provided an estimate of 2,280 blue whales in the Antarctic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Several congregating grounds are recently confirmed in [[Oceania]], such as on Perth Canyon off [[Rottnest Island]], waters of [[Great Australian Bight]] off [[Portland, Victoria|Portland]], and in [[South Taranaki Bight]]. Both species of Southern Blues and Pygmy Blues use waters off [[Western Australia]], and coastal areas of eastern [[North Island]] of New Zealand, from [[Northland Region|Northland]] waters such as in the [[Bay of Islands]] and [[Hauraki Gulf]] in north to [[Bay of Plenty]] in the south as breeding and calving grounds by some females, and as migratory colliders (very close to shore in the NZ region&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wadedoak.com/_disc1/0000154e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;).

====Subspecies' distribution====
A fourth subspecies, ''B. m. indica'', was identified by [[Edward Blyth|Blyth]] in 1859 in the northern Indian Ocean, but difficulties in identifying distinguishing features for this subspecies led to it being used as a synonym for ''B. m. brevicauda'', the pygmy blue whale. Records for Soviet catches seem to indicate that the female adult size is closer to that of the Pygmy Blue than ''B. m. musculus'', although the populations of ''B. m. indica'' and ''B. m. brevicauda'' appear to be discrete, and the breeding seasons differ by almost six months.&lt;ref name = SHDistribution&gt;{{cite journal

|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2907.2007.00106.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Migratory patterns of these subspecies are not well known. For example, pygmy blue whales have been recorded in the northern Indian Ocean ([[Oman]], Maldives and [[Sri Lanka]]), where they may form a distinct resident population.&lt;ref name= SHDistribution /&gt; In addition, the population of blue whales occurring off [[Chile]] and [[Peru]] may also be a distinct subspecies. Some Antarctic blue whales approach the eastern South Atlantic coast in winter, and occasionally, their vocalizations are heard off Peru, Western Australia, and in the northern Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name= SHDistribution /&gt; In Chile, the [[Cetacean Conservation Center]], with support from the [[Chilean Navy]], is undertaking extensive research and conservation work on a recently discovered feeding aggregation of the species off the coast of [[Chiloe Island]] in the [[Gulf of Corcovado]]([[Chiloé National Park]]), where 326 blue whales were spotted in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Efforts to calculate the blue whale population more accurately are supported by marine mammologists at [[Duke University]], who maintain the Ocean Biogeographic Information System—Spatial Ecological Analysis of Megavertebrate Populations (OBIS-SEAMAP), a collation of marine mammal sighting data from around 130 sources.&lt;ref&gt;The data for the blue whale, along with a species profile, may be found here [http://seamap.env.duke.edu/species/tsn/180528]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to their enormous size, power and speed, adult blue whales have virtually no natural predators. There is one documented case in ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'' of a blue whale being attacked by [[orca]]s off the [[Baja California Peninsula]]; although the orcas were unable to kill the animal outright during their attack, the blue whale sustained serious wounds and probably died as a result of them shortly after the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

With [[global warming]] causing glaciers and permafrost to melt rapidly and allowing a large amount of fresh water to flow into the oceans, there are concerns that if the amount of fresh water in the oceans reaches a critical point, there will be a [[Shutdown of thermohaline circulation|disruption in the thermohaline circulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schiermeier |first=Quirin |year=2007 |title=Climate change: a sea change |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=439 |issue=7074 |pages=256–260 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v439/n7074/full/439256a.html |doi=10.1038/439256a |pmid=16421539}} (subscription required); see also {{cite web |title=Atlantic circulation change summary |date=19 January 2006 |work=RealClimate.org |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the blue whale's migratory patterns are based on ocean temperature, a disruption in this circulation, which moves warm and cold water around the world, would be likely to have an effect on their migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The Museum of Natural History in Gothenburg, Sweden contains the only stuffed blue whale in the world. There one can also find the skeleton of the whale mounted beside the whale.

The [[Melbourne Museum]] features a skeleton of the [[pygmy blue whale]].

The [[North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] features a mounted skeleton of a blue whale which visitors can view from both the first and second floors.

The [[South African Museum]] in [[Cape Town, South Africa]], features a considerable hall devoted to Whales and natural history known as the Whale Well. The centrepiece of the exhibit is a suspended mounted Blue Whale skeleton, gleaned from the carcass of a partially mature specimen which washed ashore in the mid 1980s. The skeleton's jaw bones are mounted on the floor of Whale Well to permit visitors a direct contact with them, and to walk between them so as to appreciate the size of the animal. Other mounted skeletons include that of a [[Humpback Whale]] and a [[Right Whale]], together with in-scale composite models of other whales, dolphins and porpoises.

The [[Tokyo National Museum]] in [[Ueno Park]] displays a life-sized model of a blue whale in the front. Several other institutions such as [[Tokai University]] and Taiji Whale Museum hold skeleton of skeleton model of Pygmy blue whales, while several churches and buildings in western Japan including [[Nagasaki Prefecture]] display jawbone of captured animals as a gate.
