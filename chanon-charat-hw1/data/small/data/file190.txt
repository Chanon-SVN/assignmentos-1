==Etymology==
[[File:Arabic components (letters) in the word Allah.svg|thumb|right|240px| The Arabic components that build-up the word &quot;Allah&quot;: &lt;br&gt;1. [[Aleph#Arabic|alif]]&lt;br&gt;2. [[Hamza#Hamzat waṣl|hamzat waṣl]] (همزة وصل)&lt;br&gt;3. [[lām]]&lt;br&gt;4. lām&lt;br&gt;5. [[shadda]] (شدة) &lt;br&gt;6. [[dagger alif]] (ألف خنجرية) &lt;br&gt;7. [[hāʾ]]]]
The term ''Allāh'' is derived from a [[Synalepha|contraction]] of the Arabic definite article ''[[al-]]'' &quot;the&quot; and ''[[ilāh|{{transl|ar|ALA|ilāh}}]]'' &quot;deity, god&quot; to ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-lāh}}'' meaning &quot;the [sole] deity, God&quot; ({{lang|grc|ὁ θεὸς μόνος}}, ''ho theos monos'').&lt;ref name=&quot;EoI&quot;&gt;L. Gardet, ''Allah'', Encyclopaedia of Islam&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Cognates]] of the name &quot;Allāh&quot; exist in other [[Semitic languages]], including [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Columbia Encyclopaedia says: Derived from an old Semitic root referring to the Divine and used in the Canaanite ''[[El (deity)|El]]'', the Mesopotamian ''[[Ilah|ilu]]'', and the biblical ''[[Elohim]]'' and ''[[Eloah]]'', the word Allah is used by all Arabic-speaking Muslims, Christians, Jews, and other monotheists.&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding [[Aramaic]] form is ''Elah'' ({{lang|arc|אלה}}), but its emphatic state is ''Elaha'' ({{lang|arc|אלהא}}). It is written as {{lang|arc|ܐܠܗܐ}} (''{{Unicode|ʼĔlāhā}}'') in [[Biblical Aramaic]] and {{lang|arc|ܐܲܠܵܗܵܐ}} (''{{Unicode|ʼAlâhâ}}'') in [[Syriac language|Syriac]] as used by the [[Assyrian Christians|Assyrian Church]], both meaning simply &quot;God&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;cal&quot;&gt;[http://cal1.cn.huc.edu The Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon] – Entry for ''{{Unicode|ʼlh}}'' {{Wayback|url=http://cal1.cn.huc.edu|date =20131018045941}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Biblical Hebrew]] mostly uses the plural (but functional singular) form ''[[Elohim]]'' ({{lang|arc|אלהים}}), but more rarely it also uses the singular form ''Eloah'' ({{lang|arc|אלוהּ}}). In the [[Sikhism|Sikh]] scripture of [[Guru Granth Sahib]], the term ''Allah'' ({{lang-pa|ਅਲਹੁ|ਅਲਾਹ }}) is used 37 times.&lt;ref name=&quot;GGS&quot;&gt;http://www.srigranth.org {{Wayback|url=http://www.srigranth.org|date =20140111041559}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name was previously used by [[Arabian mythology|pagan]] [[Mecca]]ns as a reference to a [[creator deity]], possibly the supreme deity in [[pre-Islamic Arabia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;L. Gardet, &quot;Allah&quot;, ''Encyclopedia of Islam''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;smith&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Smith |first= Peter |encyclopedia= A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title= prayer |year= 2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location= Oxford |isbn= 978-1-85168-184-6 |pages= 274–275}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The concepts associated with the term ''Allah'' (as a deity) differ among religious traditions. In pre-Islamic Arabia amongst pagan Arabs, ''Allah'' was not considered the sole divinity, having associates and companions, sons and daughters–a concept that was deleted under the process of [[Islamization]]. In Islam, the name ''Allah'' is the supreme and all-comprehensive divine name, and all other divine names are believed to refer back to Allah.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tao-Islam&quot;&gt;

==Usage==
The name ''Allah'' or ''Alla'' was found in the [[Epic of Atrahasis]] engraved on several tablets dating back to around 1700&amp;nbsp;BC in [[Babylon]], which showed that he was being worshipped as a high deity among other gods who were considered to be his brothers but taking orders from him.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Dalley (1989), ''Myths from Mesopotamia: Creation, the Flood, Gilgamesh, and Others'', Oxford University Press, Pages: 3-10&lt;/ref&gt;

Many inscriptions containing the name ''Allah'' have been discovered in Northern and Southern Arabia as early as the 5th century B.C., including [[Lihyanitic]], [[Thamudic]] and South Arabian inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;René Dussaud, ''Les Arabes en Syrie avant l’Islam'' (Paris, Ernest Leroux, 1907), Pages: 141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Hitti, ''History of the Arabs: From the Earliest Times to the Present'', Tenth Edition (New York: St. Martin’s Press, 1970), Pages: 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. V. Winnett, ''A Study of the Lihyanite and Thamudic Inscriptions'' (Toronto: 1937), Pages: 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth J. Thomas, ''The Bible Translator: Technical Papers'', Vol. 52:3, (July 2001), Pages: 301-305&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dumuzid the Shepherd]], a king of the 1st Dynasty of [[Uruk]] named on the [[Sumerian King List]], was later over-venerated so that people started associating him with &quot;Alla&quot; and the Babylonian god [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]].&lt;ref&gt;Thorkild Jacobsen, ''The Harps that Once: Sumerian Poetry in Translation'' (1997), Yale University Press, Part. 1, Pages: 53-61&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nabataeans===

The name Allah was used by [[Nabataeans]] in compound names, such as &quot;''Abd Allah''&quot; (The Servant/Slave of Allah), &quot;''Aush Allah''&quot; (The Faith of Allah), &quot;''Amat Allah''&quot; (The She-Servant of Allah), &quot;''Hab Allah''&quot; (Beloved of Allah), &quot;''Han Allah''&quot; (Allah is gracious), &quot;''Shalm Allah''&quot; (Peace of Allah), while the name  &quot;''Wahab Allah''&quot; (The Gift of Allah) was found
throughout the entire region of the [[Nabataean]] kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Kees Versteegh, The Arabic Language (1997), Columbia University Press-New York, Page: 30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Gibson, The Nabataeans: Builders of Petra (2003), Page: 209&lt;/ref&gt;

From [[Nabataean]] inscriptions, Allah seems to have been regarded as a &quot;High and Main God&quot;, while other deities were considered to be mediators before Allah and of a second status, which was the same case of the worshipers at the [[Kaaba]] temple at [[Mecca]].&lt;ref&gt;John F. Healey, The Religion of the Nabataeans: A Conspectus (2000), Brill Publishing, Page: 83&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-Islamic Meccans===
Meccans worshipped him and [[Al-lāt]], [[Al-‘Uzzá]], [[Manāt]] as his daughters. Some Jews might have considered [[Uzair]] to be his son.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}} Christians and [[Hanif]]s used the term 'Bismillah', 'in the name of Allah' and the name Allah to refer to the supreme Deity in Arabic stone inscriptions centuries before Islam.&lt;ref name= Hitti&gt;{{cite book | last = Hitti | first = Philip Khouri | title = History of the Arabs  | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan  | date = 2002-09-06  | location = Basingstoke  | pages = 800 | isbn = 9780333631423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Istanbul, Hagia Sophia, Allah.jpg|thumb|Medallion showing &quot;Allah [[Jalla Jalaluhu]]&quot; in [[Hagia Sophia]], [[Istanbul]], Turkey.]]
According to Islamic belief, Allah is the [[Proper noun|proper name]] of God,&lt;ref name=&quot;EoQ&quot;&gt;Böwering, Gerhard, ''God and His Attributes'', Encyclopaedia of the Qurʼān, Brill, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and humble submission to his will, divine ordinances and commandments is the pivot of the Muslim faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; &quot;He is the only God, creator of the universe, and the judge of humankind.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;Britannica Concise Encyclopedia, ''Allah''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMMENA&quot;/&gt; &quot;He is unique (''{{transl|ar|ALA|wāḥid}}'') and inherently one (''{{transl|ar|ALA|aḥad}}''), all-merciful and omnipotent.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; The Qur'an declares &quot;the reality of Allah, His inaccessible mystery, His various names, and His actions on behalf of His creatures.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Dcp7323-Edirne-Eski Camii Allah.jpg|thumb|150px|Allah script outside [[Eski Cami]] (The Old Mosque) in [[Edirne]], Turkey.]]
In Islamic tradition, there are [[99 Names of God]] (''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-asmā’ al-ḥusná}}'' lit. meaning: 'the best names' or 'the most beautiful names'), each of which evoke a distinct characteristic of Allah.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMMENA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ben&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Bentley |first=David |title=The 99 Beautiful Names for God for All the People of the Book |publisher=William Carey Library |date=September 1999 |isbn=978-0-87808-299-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All these names refer to Allah, the supreme and all-comprehensive divine name.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tao-Islam&quot;/&gt; Among the 99 names of God, the most famous and most frequent of these names are &quot;the Merciful&quot; (''[[Rahman (name)|al-Raḥmān]]'') and &quot;the Compassionate&quot; (''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-Raḥīm}}'').&lt;ref name=&quot;EncMMENA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ben&quot;/&gt;

Most Muslims use the untranslated Arabic phrase ''[[Insha'Allah|{{transl|ar|ALA|in shā’ Allāh}}]]'' (meaning 'if God wills') after references to future events.&lt;ref&gt;Gary S. Gregg, ''The Middle East: A Cultural Psychology'', Oxford University Press, p.30&lt;/ref&gt; Muslim discursive piety encourages beginning things with the invocation of ''[[Basmala|{{transl|ar|ALA|bismillāh}}]]'' (meaning 'in the name of God').&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban, ''Islamic Society in Practice'', University Press of Florida, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

There are certain phrases in praise of God that are favored by Muslims, including &quot;[[subhan'allah|Subḥān Allāh]]&quot; (Holiness be to God), &quot;[[Alhamdulillah|al-ḥamdu lillāh]]&quot; (Praise be to God), &quot;[[Shahada|{{transl|ar|ALA|lā ilāha illā Allāh}}]]&quot; (There is no deity but God) and &quot;[[Takbir|Allāhu akbar]]&quot; (God is greater) as a devotional exercise of remembering God ([[dhikr]]).&lt;ref&gt;M. Mukarram Ahmed, Muzaffar Husain Syed, ''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Anmol Publications PVT. LTD, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Sufi]] practice known as ''dhikr Allah'' (lit. remembrance of God), the Sufi repeats and contemplates on the name ''Allah'' or other divine names while controlling his or her breath.&lt;ref&gt;Carl W. Ernst, Bruce B. Lawrence, ''Sufi Martyrs of Love: The Chishti Order in South Asia and Beyond'', Macmillan, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars{{Who|date=December 2008}} have suggested that Muḥammad used the term ''Allah'' in addressing both pagan Arabs and Jews or Christians in order to establish a common ground for the understanding of the name for God, a claim Gerhard Böwering says is doubtful.&lt;ref name=&quot;EoQ&quot;/&gt; According to Böwering, in contrast with pre-Islamic Arabian [[polytheism]], God in Islam does not have associates and companions, nor is there any kinship between God and [[jinn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EoQ&quot;/&gt; Pre-Islamic pagan Arabs believed in a blind, powerful, inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control. This was replaced with the Islamic notion of a powerful but provident and merciful God.&lt;ref&gt;Allah, ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Francis Edwards Peters]], &quot;The [[Qur'an|Qur’ān]] insists, Muslims believe, and historians affirm that [[Muhammad]] and his followers worship the same God as the Jews ({{cite quran|29|46|style=nosup|expand=no}}). The Qur’an's Allah is the same Creator God who covenanted with [[Abraham]]&quot;. Peters states that the Qur'an portrays Allah as both more powerful and more remote than Yahweh, and as a universal deity, unlike Yahweh who closely follows [[Israel]]ites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peters1&quot;&gt;F.E. Peters, ''Islam'', p.4, Princeton University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
The [[Aramaic]] word for &quot;God&quot; in the language of [[Assyrian Christians]] is ''{{Unicode|ʼĔlāhā}}'', or ''Alaha''. [[Arabic language|Arabic]]-speakers of all Abrahamic faiths, including Christians and Jews, use the word &quot;Allah&quot; to mean &quot;God&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia&quot;/&gt; The Christian Arabs of today have no other word for &quot;God&quot; than &quot;Allah&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cambridge&quot;/&gt; (Even the Arabic-descended [[Maltese language]] of [[Malta]], whose population is almost entirely Roman Catholic, uses ''Alla'' for &quot;God&quot;.) Arab Christians, for example, use the terms ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Allāh al-ab}}'' ({{lang|ar|الله الأب}}) for [[God the Father]], ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Allāh al-ibn}}'' ({{lang|ar|الله الابن}}) for [[Son of God|God the Son]], and ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Allāh al-rūḥ al-quds}}'' ({{lang|ar|الله الروح القدس}}) for [[Holy Spirit|God the Holy Spirit]]. (See [[God in Christianity]] for the Christian concept of God.)

[[Arab Christian]]s have used two forms of invocations that were [[affix]]ed to the beginning of their written works. They adopted the Muslim ''{{transl|ar|ALA|bismillāh}}'', and also created their own Trinitized ''{{transl|ar|ALA|bismillāh}}'' as early as the 8th century CE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;/&gt; The Muslim ''{{transl|ar|ALA|bismillāh}}'' reads: &quot;In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.&quot; The Trinitized ''{{transl|ar|ALA|bismillāh}}'' reads: &quot;In the name of Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, One God.&quot; The [[Syriac]], [[Latin]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] invocations do not have the words &quot;One God&quot; at the end. This addition was made to emphasize the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] aspect of Trinitian belief and also to make it more palatable to Muslims.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;&gt;Thomas E. Burman, ''Religious Polemic and the Intellectual History of the Mozarabs'', [[Brill Publishers|Brill]], 1994, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Marshall Hodgson]], it seems that in the pre-Islamic times, some Arab Christians made pilgrimage to the Ka‘bah, a pagan temple at that time, honoring Allah there as God the Creator.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall G. S. Hodgson, ''The Venture of Islam: Conscience and History in a World Civilization'', [[University of Chicago Press]], p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

Some archaeological excavation quests have led to the discovery of ancient [[pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic]] inscriptions and tombs made by [[Arab Christians|Arabic-speaking Christians]] in the ruins of a church at [[Umm el-Jimal]] in Northern [[Jordan]], which contained references to Allah as the proper name of God, and some of the graves contained names such as &quot;Abd Allah&quot; which means &quot;the servant/slave of Allah&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;James Bellamy, ‘Two Pre-Islamic Arabic Inscriptions Revised: Jabal Ramm and Umm al-Jimal’, Journal of the American Oriental Society, 108/3 (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Enno Littmann, Arabic Inscriptions (Leiden, 1949)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rick Brown, Who is &quot;Allah&quot; ? - International Journal of Frontier Missions, (23:2 Summer 2006), page 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Allah can be found countless times in the reports and the lists of names of Christian martyrs in South Arabia, as reported by antique Syriac documents of the names of those martyrs from the era of the [[Himyarite]] and [[Aksumite]] kingdoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;rick brown&quot;&gt;Rick Brown, Who was ‘Allah’ before Islam?

A Christian leader named Abd Allah ibn Abu Bakr ibn Muhammad was martyred in Najran in 523&amp;nbsp;AD, as he had worn a ring that said &quot;Allah is my lord&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rick brown&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Guillaume&amp; Muhammad Ibn Ishaq, (2002 [1955]). The Life of Muhammad: A Translation of Isḥāq’s Sīrat Rasūl Allāh with Introduction and Notes. Karachi and New York: Oxford University Press, page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an inscription of Christian martyrion dated back to 512&amp;nbsp;AD, references to Allah can be found in both Arabic and Aramaic, which called him &quot;Allah&quot; and &quot;Alaha&quot;, and the inscription starts with the statement &quot;By the Help of Allah&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rick brown&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adolf Grohmann, Arabische Paläographie II: Das Schriftwesen und die Lapidarschrift (1971), Wien: Hermann Böhlaus Nochfolger, Page: 6-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beatrice Gruendler, The Development of the Arabic Scripts: From the Nabatean Era to the First Islamic Century according to Dated Texts (1993), Atlanta: Scholars Press, Page:&lt;/ref&gt;

In pre-Islamic Gospels, the name used for God was &quot;Allah&quot;, as evidenced by some discovered Arabic versions of the [[New Testament]] written by [[Arab Christians]] during the pre-Islamic era in Northern and Southern [[Arabia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;before&quot;&gt;Rick Brown, Who was ‘Allah’ before Islam?

Pre-Islamic Arab Christians have been reported to have raised the battle cry &quot;''Ya La Ibad Allah''&quot; (O slaves of Allah) to invoke each other into battle.&lt;ref&gt;Irfan Shahîd, Byzantium and the Arabs in the Fourth Century, Dumbarton Oaks Trustees for Harvard University-Washington DC, page 418.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Allah&quot; was also mentioned in pre-Islamic Christian poems by some [[Ghassanid]] and [[Tanukhids|Tanukhid]] poets in [[Syria]] and Northern [[Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;Irfan Shahîd, Byzantium and the Arabs in the Fourth Century, Dumbarton Oaks Trustees for Harvard University-Washington DC, Page: 452&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.

As [[Hebrew]] and [[Arabic]] are closely related [[Semitic]] languages, it is commonly accepted that ''Allah'' (root, ''[[ilāh|{{transl|ar|ALA|ilāh}}]]'') and the Biblical ''[[Elohim]]'' are cognate derivations of same origin, as is ''[[Eloah]]'', a Hebrew word which is used (e.g. in the [[Book of Job]]) to mean '(the) God' and also 'god or gods' as is the case of ''Elohim''. ''Elohim'' and ''Eloah'' ultimately derive from the root ''El'', 'strong', possibly genericized from [[El (deity)]], as in the [[Ugaritic]] ''’lhm'' (consonants only), meaning &quot;children of El&quot; (the ancient Near Eastern creator god in pre-Abrahamic tradition).&lt;ref name=&quot;BDB&quot; /&gt;

In Jewish scripture [[Elohim]] is used as a descriptive title for the God of the scriptures, whose personal name is [[YHWH]], Elohim is also used for plural pagan gods.&lt;ref name=&quot;BDB&quot; /&gt;

The history of the name ''Allāh'' in English was probably influenced by the study of [[comparative religion]] in the 19th century; for example, [[Thomas Carlyle]] (1840) sometimes used the term Allah but without any implication that Allah was anything different from God. However, in his biography of Muḥammad (1934), [[Tor Andræ]] always used the term ''Allah'', though he allows that this &quot;conception of God&quot; seems to imply that it is different from that of the Jewish and Christian theologies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Watt45&quot;&gt;William Montgomery Watt, ''Islam and Christianity today: A Contribution to Dialogue'', [[Routledge]], 1983, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

Languages which may not commonly use the term ''Allah'' to denote God may still contain popular expressions which use the word. For example, because of the centuries long [[Al-Andalus|Muslim presence in the Iberian Peninsula]], the word ''ojalá'' in the Spanish language and ''oxalá'' in the [[Portuguese language]] exist today, borrowed from [[Arabic]] (Arabic: إن شاء الله). This phrase literally means 'if God wills' (in the sense of &quot;I hope so&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Islam in Luce López Baralt, ''Spanish Literature: From the Middle Ages to the Present'', Brill, 1992, p.25&lt;/ref&gt; The German poet [[Siegfried August Mahlmann|Mahlmann]] used the form &quot;Allah&quot; as the title of a poem about the ultimate deity, though it is unclear how much Islamic thought he intended to convey.

Some Muslims leave the name &quot;Allāh&quot; untranslated in English.&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Peters, ''The Monotheists: Jews, Christians, and Muslims in Conflict and Competition'', [[Princeton University Press]], p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians in Malaysia and Indonesia use ''Allah'' to refer to God in the [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] and [[Indonesian language]]s (both of which are standardized forms of the [[Malay language]].)  Mainstream Bible translations in the language use ''Allah'' as the translation of Hebrew [[Elohim]] (translated in English Bibles as &quot;God&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;Example: [http://alkitab.sabda.org/verse.php?book=Mat&amp;chapter=22&amp;verse=32&amp;search=allah&amp;scope=all&amp;exact=off Usage of the word &quot;Allah&quot; from Matthew 22:32 in Indonesian bible versions (parallel view) as old as 1733] {{Wayback|url=http://alkitab.sabda.org/verse.php?book=Mat&amp;chapter=22&amp;verse=32&amp;search=allah&amp;scope=all&amp;exact=off|date =20131019125828}}&lt;/ref&gt; This goes back to early translation work by [[Francis Xavier]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;The Indonesian Language: Its History and Role in Modern Society Sneddon, James M.; University of New South Wales Press; 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The History of Christianity in India from the Commencement of the Christian Era: Hough, James; Adamant Media Corporation; 2001&lt;/ref&gt; The first dictionary of Dutch-Malay by Albert Cornelius Ruyl, Justus Heurnius, and Caspar Wiltens in 1650 (revised edition from 1623 edition and 1631 Latin-edition) recorded &quot;Allah&quot; as the translation of the Dutch word &quot;[[:en:God|Godt]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.co.id/books?id=3GcTAAAAQAAJ&amp;v=onepage&amp;q=allah&amp;f=false |title=Justus Heurnius, Albert Ruyl, Caspar Wiltens. &quot;Vocabularium ofte Woordenboeck nae ordre van den alphabeth, in 't Duytsch en Maleys&quot;. 1650:65 |publisher=Books.google.co.id |date= |accessdate=2014-01-14|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20131022172808/http://books.google.co.id/books?id=3GcTAAAAQAAJ&amp;v=onepage&amp;q=allah&amp;f=false|archivedate=2013-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruyl also translated [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] in 1612 to Malay language (first Bible translation to non-European language, only a year after [[King James Version]] was published&lt;ref&gt;Barton, John (2002–12).

The [[government of Malaysia]] in 2007 outlawed usage of the term ''Allah'' in any other but Muslim contexts, but the [[High Court of Malaya|Malayan High Court]] in 2009 revoked the law, ruling that it was unconstitutional. While ''Allah'' had been used for the Christian God in Malay for more than four centuries, the contemporary controversy was triggered by usage of ''Allah'' by the Roman Catholic newspaper ''[[The Herald (Malaysian Catholic Weekly)|The Herald]]''. The government appealed the court ruling, and the High Court suspended implementation of its verdict until the appeal was heard. In October 2013, the court ruled in favor of the government's ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=No more 'Allah' for Christians, Malaysian court says |first=Simon |last=Roughneen |url= |newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |date=14 October 2013 |accessdate=14 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in early 2014, the Malaysian government confiscated more than 300 bibles for using the word to refer to the Christian God in Peninsular Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-25578348|title=BBC News - More than 300 Bibles are confiscated in Malaysia|publisher=BBC|date=2 January 2014|accessdate=14 January 2014|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140125052310/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-25578348|archivedate=25 January 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of Allah does not prohibited in the two Malaysian state of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]].&lt;ref name=&quot;settle&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=87900|title=Catholic priest should respect court: Mahathir|publisher=[[Daily Express (Sabah)|Daily Express]]|date=9 January 2014|accessdate=10 January 2014|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140110085352/http://www.dailyexpress.com.my/news.cfm?NewsID=87900|archivedate=10 January 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2014/03/29/worship-without-hindrance/|title=Worship without hindrance|author=Jane Moh and Peter Sibon|publisher=[[The Borneo Post]]|date=29 March 2014|accessdate=29 March 2014|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20140329094134/http://www.theborneopost.com/2014/03/29/worship-without-hindrance/|archivedate=29 March 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason it is not prohibited in these two states is that usage has been long-established and local Alkitab ([[Bibles]]) have been widely distributed freely in East Malaysia without restrictions for years.&lt;ref name=&quot;settle&quot;/&gt; Both states also do not have similar Islamic state laws as those in West Malaysia.&lt;ref name=&quot;10 point&quot;/&gt;

The word ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Allāh}}'' is always written without an [[aleph|{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}]] to spell the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ā}}'' vowel. This is because the spelling was settled before Arabic spelling started habitually using ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}'' to spell ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ā}}''. However, in vocalized spelling, a small diacritic ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}'' is added on top of the ''[[shadda|{{transl|ar|ALA|shaddah}}]]'' to indicate the pronunciation.

One exception may be in the pre-Islamic [[History of the Arabic alphabet#Pre-Islamic Arabic inscriptions|Zabad inscription]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; where it ends with an ambiguous sign that may be a lone-standing ''h'' with a lengthened start, or may be a non-standard conjoined ''{{transl|ar|ALA|l-h}}'':-
* {{lang|ar| الاه }}: This reading would be ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Allāh}}'' spelled phonetically with ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}'' for the ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ā}}''.
* {{lang|ar| الإله }}: This reading would be ''{{transl|ar|ALA|al-Ilāh}}'' = 'the god' (an older form, without contraction), by older spelling practice without ''{{transl|ar|ALA|alif}}'' for ''{{transl|ar|ALA|ā}}''.

===Unicode===
[[Unicode]] has a codepoint reserved for ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Allāh}}'', {{script/Arabic|ﷲ}} = U+FDF2, in the [[Arabic Presentation Forms-A]] block, which exists solely for &quot;compatibility with some older, legacy character sets that encoded presentation forms directly&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;The Unicode Consortium. [http://www.unicode.org/faq/middleeast.html#5 FAQ - Middle East Scripts] {{Wayback|url=http://www.unicode.org/faq/middleeast.html#5|date =20131001110649}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is discouraged for new text. Instead, the word ''{{transl|ar|ALA|Allāh}}'' should be represented by its individual Arabic letters, while modern font technologies will render the desired ligature.

The calligraphic variant of the word used as the [[Coat of arms of Iran]] is encoded in Unicode, in the [[Miscellaneous Symbols]] range, at codepoint U+262B ({{unicode|☫}}).
