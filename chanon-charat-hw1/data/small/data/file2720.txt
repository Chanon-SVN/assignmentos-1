==Career==

===Comedy===
After attending Lapal Primary School, Halesowen Grammar School (now [[Earls High School|The Earls High School]], [[Halesowen]]) then [[King Edward's School, Birmingham]], where he captained the school's [[rugby union]] team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2082578/Bill-Oddie-remembers-answering-school-eventually-prefect.html |title=Me and my school photo: Bill Oddie remembers answering back and eventually becoming a prefect |newspaper=Daily Mail |first=Peter |last=Robertson |date=5 January 2012 |accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oddie went on to study [[English Literature]] at [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]] at the University of Cambridge, where he appeared in several [[Footlights|Cambridge University Footlights Club]] productions.

One of these, a [[revue]] called ''A Clump of Plinths'', was so successful at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] that it was renamed ''[[Cambridge Footlights Revue|Cambridge Circus]]'' and transferred to the West End in London, then [[New Zealand]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in September 1964. Meanwhile, still at Cambridge, Oddie wrote scripts for TV's ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]''.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first television appearance was in [[Bernard Braden]]'s ''On The Braden Beat'' in 1964. Subsequently, he was a key member of the performers in the  [[BBC]] radio series ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'' (ISIRTA; 1965), where many of his musical compositions were featured. Some were released on the album ''Distinctly Oddie'' (Polydor, 1967). He was possibly one of the first performers to [[parody]] a rock song, arranging the traditional [[Yorkshire]] folk song &quot;[[On Ilkla Moor Baht'at]]&quot; in the style of [[Joe Cocker]]'s hit rendition of [[the Beatles]]' &quot;[[With a Little Help from My Friends]]&quot; (released on [[John Peel]]'s [[Dandelion Records]] in 1970 and featured in Peel's special box of most-treasured singles), and singing &quot;[[Andy Pandy]]&quot; in the style of a brassy soul number such as [[Wilson Pickett]] or [[Geno Washington]] might perform. In many shows he would do short impressions of [[Hughie Green]].

In one song on ''[[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]'', Oddie performed &quot;[[What a Wonderful World]]&quot; with a voice fully reminiscent of [[Louis Armstrong]]. During the course of the song, the rest of the cast attributed the gravelly quality of his voice to a sore throat. In the background, during the rest of the song, it is possible to hear the cast dispense cough medicine, then call for a doctor, the arrival of the doctor and his decision that Oddie should go into hospital, the trip to hospital in an ambulance, and the operation extracting his tonsils. After this, the sound of his voice changed to a sound closer to that of [[Harry Secombe]]. He thanked the cast for curing him. On television Oddie was co-writer and performer in the comedy series ''[[Twice a Fortnight]]'' with [[Graeme Garden]], [[Terry Jones]], [[Michael Palin]] and [[Jonathan Lynn]]. Later, he was co-writer and performer in the comedy series ''[[Broaden Your Mind]]'' with [[Tim Brooke-Taylor]] and Graeme Garden, for which Oddie became a cast member for the second series.

Oddie, Brooke-Taylor and Garden then co-wrote and appeared in their television comedy series ''[[The Goodies (TV series)|The Goodies]]''. The Goodies also released records, including &quot;Father Christmas Do Not Touch Me&quot;/&quot;The In-Betweenies&quot;, &quot;[[Funky Gibbon]]&quot;, and &quot;Black Pudding Bertha&quot;, which were hit singles in 1974–75. They reformed, briefly, in 2005, for a successful 13-date tour of Australia.

Oddie, Brooke-Taylor and Garden voiced characters on the 1983 animated children's programme ''[[Bananaman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.80scartoons.co.uk/bananaman2.php |title=&quot;Bananaman&quot; – 80s Cartoons |publisher=80scartoons.co.uk |date=2012-02-04 |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalhero.co.uk/b/banaman.htm |title=Bananaman – International Hero |publisher=Internationalhero.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.johnnorrisbrown.com/classic-nick/bananaman/index.htm |title=&quot;Bananaman&quot; – Classic Nick Online |publisher=Johnnorrisbrown.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Amnesty International show ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'', Oddie, Brooke-Taylor and Garden sang their hit song &quot;Funky Gibbon&quot;. They also appeared on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' with the song. Together with Garden (who is a qualified doctor), Oddie co-wrote many episodes of the television comedy series ''[[Doctor in the House (TV series)|Doctor in the House]]'', including most of the first season and all of the second season. He has occasionally appeared on the BBC Radio 4 panel game ''[[I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue]]'', on which Garden and Brooke-Taylor are regular panellists. In 1982 Garden and Oddie wrote, but did not perform in, a 6-part science fiction sitcom called ''[[Astronauts (television)|Astronauts]]'' for [[Central Independent Television|Central]] and [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. The show was set in an international [[space station]] in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{British Comedy Guide|sitcom|sitcoms/astronauts.shtml|Astronauts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural history===

Oddie's first published work was an article about the birdlife of Birmingham's [[Bartley Reservoir]] in the [[West Midland Bird Club]]'s 1962 Annual Report&lt;ref name=&quot;Oddie-1963&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oddie|first=W.E.|date=July 1963|title=Birds in the Bartley Reservoir Area, 1931-1962 (Part I)|journal=The West Midland Bird Report, 1962|publisher=[[West Midland Bird Club]]|location=Birmingham|volume=29|url=http://www.westmidlandbirdclub.com/archive/bartley-62.htm|accessdate=13 February 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110514235149/http://www.westmidlandbirdclub.com/archive/bartley-62.htm|archivedate=14 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (he is first credited in the 1956 report, in which reports of his bird observations are tagged with his initials &quot;WEO&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NWS&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode | title = Nature Watch Special: Bill Oddie - Bird Watcher | series = | serieslink =  | url =  | accessdate = | network =  | station = ITV Central | date = 30 July 1985  | season =  | seriesno =  | number = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=July 1957|journal=The West Midland Bird Report, 1956|publisher=[[West Midland Bird Club]]| location=Birmingham|volume=23|url=http://www.westmidlandbirdclub.com/archive/reports1950s#R1956|accessdate=4 January 2013 | title=Annual Report, 1950s|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20130602102919/http://www.westmidlandbirdclub.com/archive/reports1950s#R1956|archivedate=2 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;). He has since written a number of books about birds and birdwatching, as well as articles for many specialist publications including ''[[British Birds (Magazine)|British Birds]]'', ''Birdwatching Magazine'' and ''[[Birdwatch]]''.

He discussed bird song recordings with Derek Jones in an August 1973 [[BBC Radio 4]] programme called ''Sounds Natural''.&lt;ref name=&quot;SN&quot;&gt;[[Radio Times]] entry for {{Cite episode | title = Sounds Natural | series = | serieslink =  | url =  | accessdate = 12 September 2013 | network = [[BBC Radio]]  | station = [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] | date = 13 August 1973 | season =  | seriesno =  | number =  | transcript =  | transcripturl = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the autumn of 1976 Oddie was involved in the successful identification of Britain's first ever record of [[Pallas's Reed Bunting]] on [[Fair Isle]], Shetland.&lt;ref name=&quot;pallas&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=First for Britain and Ireland 1600–1999 |first=Philip |last=Palmer |publisher=Arlequin Press |location=Chelmsford |year=2000 |isbn=1-900159-41-4 |page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Oddie's first forays in the world of television natural history was as a guest on ''[[Animal Magic (TV series)|Animal Magic]]'' in December 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;AM&quot;&gt;[[Radio Times]] entry for {{Cite episode | title =  | series = [[Animal Magic (TV series)|Animal Magic]] | serieslink =  | url =  | accessdate = 12 September 2013 | network = [[BBC Television]]  | station = [[BBC One]] | date = 13 December 1977 | season =  | seriesno =  | number =  | transcript =  | transcripturl = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early natural history radio appearance was in October, as the guest on Radio 4's ''Through My Window'', discussing the birds of [[Hampstead Heath]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TMW&quot;&gt;[[Radio Times]] entry for {{Cite episode | title = | series = Through My Window | serieslink =  | url =  | accessdate = 12 September 2013 | network = [[BBC Radio]]  | station = [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] | date = 11 October 1978 | season =  | seriesno =  | number =  | transcript =  | transcripturl = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 30 July 1985, he was the subject of a 50-minute ''Nature Watch Special: Bill Oddie - Bird Watcher'', in which he was interviewed by [[Julian Pettifer]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Choice&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://web6.infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/359/357/47201865w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS486772990&amp;dyn=21!nxt_4_0_CS486772990?sw_aep=bclib|title=Choice (Today's Television Programmes)|last=Lawson|first=Mark|date=30 July 1985|work=The Times |location=UK |page=29|accessdate=12 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; at places where he had spent time birding, including Bartley Reservoir, the [[Christopher Cadbury Wetland Reserve]] at [[Upton Warren]], [[RSPB Titchwell Marsh]] and [[Blakeney Point]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NWS&quot; /&gt;

Oddie has since hosted a number of successful nature programmes for the BBC, many produced by [[Stephen Moss]], including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/people/id/1166900/credits.html|title=Bill Oddie: Film &amp; TV Credits|publisher=www.screenonline.org.uk|accessdate=12 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Oddie set up a [[marathon|half-marathon]] to raise money for various wildlife charities in his birth-town of [[Rochdale]].&lt;ref name=&quot;towntalk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rochdale.towntalk.co.uk/local/famous-people/d/600/bill-oddie/ |title=Bill Oddie of Rochdale |publisher=TownTalk |accessdate=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Celebrities who have participated in the event include [[Ray Mears]], [[Catherine Jenkins]] and [[Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall]].

In 2011, Oddie featured as an investigator in ''Snares Uncovered: killers in the countryside''.&lt;ref name=&quot;onekind&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.onekind.org/take_action/campaigns/snare_free/snares_uncovered/| title=Snares Uncovered | publisher=onekind.org | accessdate=15 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film carried out an expose of snaring in Scotland and was commissioned by animal protection charity [[OneKind]]. During the investigation, Oddie discovered over 70 snare traps and several stink pits.

===Music===
Oddie wrote original music at [[The University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] for the [[Footlights]] and later wrote comic songs for [[I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again]]. He also wrote a number of comic songs for [[The Goodies]], most of them performed by Oddie.

In the 1960s and early 1970s, Oddie released a number of singles and at least one album. One of the former, issued in 1970 on [[John Peel]]'s [[Dandelion Records]] label (Catalogue No: 4786), was ''[[On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eil.com/shop/moreinfo.asp?catalogid=222302|title=eil.com|publisher=eil.com|accessdate=12 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; performed in the style of [[Joe Cocker]]'s ''[[With a Little Help from my Friends]]''. The B-side, ''Harry Krishna'', featured the [[Hare Krishna (mantra)|Hare Krishna]] chant, substituting the names of contemporary famous people called Harry, including [[Harry Secombe]], [[Harry Worth]], [[Harry Lauder]], and [[Harry Corbett]], as well as [[pun]]s such as &quot;Harry [Hurry] along now&quot;, &quot;Harrystotle [Aristotle]&quot; and ending with &quot;Harry-ly [I really] must go now&quot;. Both tracks appear on the compilation CD ''Life Too, Has Surface Noise: The Complete Dandelion Records Singles Collection 1969–1972'' (2007).

He played the drums and [[saxophone]] and appeared as Cousin Kevin in a production of [[The Who]]'s rock opera ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]'' at the [[Rainbow Theatre]], [[Finsbury Park, London]] on 9 December 1972. He has also contributed vocals to a [[Rick Wakeman]] album, ''Criminal Record''.

Oddie took part in the [[English National Opera]] production of the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] [[comic opera]] ''[[The Mikado]]'', in which he appeared in the role of the &quot;Lord High Executioner&quot;, taking over the role from [[Eric Idle]]. During the early 1990s, Oddie was a DJ for London-based [[jazz]] radio station [[102.2 Jazz FM]], but was dismissed after criticising the management on air after they told him he was playing too much jazz on his show.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In 2007 Oddie appeared on the BBC series ''[[Play It Again]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/playitagain/programmes/series1/billoddie|title=Play It Again: Bill Oddie grapples with the electric guitar|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode he attempts to realise his dream of becoming a [[rock guitarist]]. Initially teacher [[Bridget Mermikides]] tries to teach him using traditional methods but he rebels: instead he turns to old friends [[Albert Lee]], [[Dave Davies]] (of [[The Kinks]]) and [[Mark Knopfler]] for advice and strikes out on his own. He succeeds in the target of playing lead guitar for his daughter Rosie's band at her 21st birthday party, and even manages to impress his erstwhile teacher.

In November 2010, he agreed, along with fellow members of [[The Goodies]], to re-release their 1970s hit The Funky Gibbon to raise funds for the [[International Primate Protection League]]'s Save the Gibbon appeal.

His agent David Foster said: &quot;Bill gets these bouts every two or three years where he gets down for about two weeks and recovers. He sometimes goes into hospital or takes a break or has a change of scenery to recharge his batteries.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |work=The Telegraph |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/4973166/TV-presenter-Bill-Oddie-admitted-to-hospital-with-clinical-depression.html |title=TV presenter Bill Oddie admitted to hospital with clinical depression |date=11 March 2009 | location=London | first=Oliver | last=Gregory | accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2010 Oddie spoke to the media, revealing that he had in fact had two separate stays in different hospitals, only being discharged &quot;in time for Christmas&quot;. He said that he was dealing with depression and [[bipolar disorder]], describing the period as &quot;probably the worst 12 months of my life&quot;. Oddie stated that he was planning to meet with BBC executives to discuss his return to television work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8448164.stm |title=Bill Oddie speaks about his depression battle |publisher=BBC News |date=8 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1241338/Bill-Oddie-reveals-feared-depression-kill-worst-12-months-life.html |title=Bill Oddie feared depression would kill him after 'the worst 12 months of my life' |work=The Daily Mail |location=UK |first=Georgina |last=Littlejohn |date=8 January 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His illness meant that Oddie did not appear in the 2009 and 2010 series of ''Springwatch'', although he made a guest appearance in the penultimate episode of the latter. He subsequently claimed he was [[Dismissal (employment)|sacked]] from Springwatch and that this had caused the depressive illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2390932/Bill-Oddie-claims-suffered-crippling-depression-axed-Springwatch.html |title='BBC put me in a mental hospital': Bill Oddie claims he suffered crippling depression after being axed from Springwatch | work=The Daily Mail | author=Simon Cable | date=13 August 2013 | accessdate=13 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oddie presented the [[BBC Radio 4]] Appeal programme on 10 August 2014 on behalf of the [[Charitable organization|charity]] Bipolar UK. He revealed that as a consequence of his bipolar disorder he had attempted [[suicide]] during one of his depressive episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04d0x5m |title=Radio 4 Appeal |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=2014-08-10 |accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
In 2001, Oddie became the third person to decline to appear on ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]''. He changed his mind a few hours later and agreed to appear on the show. On 16 October 2003, Oddie was made an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] for his service to Wildlife Conservation in a ceremony at [[Buckingham Palace]].

==In popular culture==
In the fictional world of comedy character [[Alan Partridge]], Oddie is an unseen presence in Alan's life.

He has also been referenced, often humorously, by the hosts of ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV Series)|Top Gear]]''. [[Jeremy Clarkson]] even used a mask with Bill Oddie's face to escape speed cameras while racing the [[Nissan GT-R]] against the [[Shinkansen|Bullet train]] in Japan in the 4th episode of Top Gear's 11th series. [[James May]] also raced in Finland against a Bill Oddie lookalike, who won the race.
