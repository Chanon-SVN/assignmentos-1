'''Robert James Lee &quot;Bob&quot; Hawke''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|size=100%|sep=,|AC|GCL}} (born 9 December 1929) is an Australian [[Politics of Australia|politician]] who was the [[List of Prime Ministers of Australia|23rd]] [[Prime Minister of Australia]] and the [[Australian Labor Party|Leader of the Labor Party]] from [[Australian federal election, 1983|1983]] to [[Australian Labor Party leadership spill, December 1991|1991]]. After a decade as [[Australian Council of Trade Unions|President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions]], he was elected to the [[Parliament of Australia|House of Representatives]] as the Labor MP for [[Division of Wills|Wills]] in [[Australian federal election, 1980|1980]]. Three years later, he led Labor to a [[Australian federal election, 1983|landslide election victory]] and was sworn in as Prime Minister. He led Labor to victory at three more elections in [[Australian federal election, 1984|1984]], [[Australian federal election, 1987|1987]] and [[Australian federal election, 1990|1990]], thus making him the most successful Labor Leader in history. Hawke was eventually replaced by [[Paul Keating]] at the end of [[Australian Labor Party leadership spill, December 1991|1991]]. He remains to date Labor's longest-serving Prime Minister,  Australia's [[List of Prime Ministers of Australia by time in office|third-longest-serving Prime Minister]], and is currently the oldest living former Prime Minister.

==Early life and education==
Hawke was born in [[Bordertown, South Australia|Bordertown]], [[South Australia]] to Clem, a [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] minister, and his wife Edith (known as Ellie), a schoolteacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=D’Alpuget|first= Blanche|date=1982|title=Robert .J. Hawke: A biography|page=2|publisher=Schwartz|location=Melbourne|isbn=0867530014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His uncle, [[Albert Hawke|Albert]], was the Labor [[Premier of Western Australia]] between 1953 and 1959, and was also a close friend of [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Curtin]], who was in many ways Bob Hawke's [[role model]]. Ellie Hawke had an almost messianic belief in her son's destiny, and this contributed to his supreme self-confidence throughout his career.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, G., ''et al.'' (1998), p. 302&lt;/ref&gt; Both his parents were of [[Cornish Australian|Cornish]] origin, and he himself has stated that his background is Cornish.&lt;ref&gt;Rowse, A.L. The little land of Cornwall, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Matthew |last=Ricketson|title= The best Australian profiles|page=30|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led the Cornish writer and historian [[A.L. Rowse]] to write, &quot;Bob Hawke's characteristics are as Cornish as Australian. I know them well; the aggressive individualism, the egoism, the touchiness, the liability to resentment, even a touch of vindictiveness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sydney Cauveren. A.L. Rowse: a bibliophile's extensive bibliography, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Hawke says, while attending the 1952 World Christian Youth Conference in [[India]], &quot;there were all these poverty stricken kids at the gate of this palatial place where we were feeding our face and I just had this struck by this enormous sense of irrelevance of religion to the needs of people&quot;. He subsequently abandoned his [[Christian]] beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Elders Part 5: Bob Hawke | url = http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s2301431.htm | series = Elders with Andrew Denton | serieslink = Enough Rope | airdate = 11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time he entered politics he was a self-described [[Agnosticism|agnostic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Blanche d'Alpuget, ''Robert J. Hawke'', 87&lt;/ref&gt; Hawke told [[Andrew Denton]] in 2008 that his father's Christian faith continued to influence his outlook however: &quot;[My father] said if you believe in the fatherhood of God you must necessarily believe in the brotherhood of man, it follows necessarily, and even though I left the church and was not religious, that truth remained with me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s2301431.htm |title=ENOUGH ROPE with Andrew Denton - episode 176: Elders Part 5 - Bob Hawke (14/07/2008) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2008-07-14 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawke was educated at [[Perth Modern School]] and the [[University of Western Australia]] where he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Bachelor of Laws]]. At the age 15, he accurately boasted that he would one day become [[Prime Minister of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Iyer |first=Pico |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,951966-1,00.html |title=Australia: Hawke Swoops into Power,  Time/CNN, 14 March 1983 |publisher=Time.com |date=14 March 1983 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] in 1947 at the age of 18, and successfully applied for a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] at the end of 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, J., (1983), p.18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawke, Bob (1994), p.19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, Hawke attended University College, Oxford to commence a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]] (PPE).&lt;ref&gt;Hawke, Bob (1994), p.24&lt;/ref&gt; He soon found he was covering much the same ground as he did in his education at the University of Western Australia. Hawke then transferred to a [[Bachelor of Letters]], with a thesis on wage-fixing in Australia which was successfully presented in January 1956.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Hawke, Bob (1994), p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

His academic achievements were complemented by setting a new world speed record for beer drinking; he downed {{convert|2+1/2|imppt}} - equivalent to a [[yard of ale]] - from a [[sconce pot]] in 11&amp;nbsp;seconds as part of a college penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?ei=N60JTpuWBsOj8QPP4viJAQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=M7ByAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=The+Hawke+Memoirs |title=The Hawke Memoirs |author=Bob Hawke|page=28|publisher=Heinemann|year= 1994|accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediaman.com.au/articles/spiffing.html |title=Media Man Australia: The Online Home of Greg Tingle, Journalist &amp; TV Presenter |publisher=Mediaman.com.au |date=3 December 2003 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoirs, Hawke suggested that this single feat may have contributed to his political success more than any other, by endearing him to a voting population with a strong beer culture.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

At the age of 17, Hawke had a serious accident on his black [[Phelon &amp; Moore#Panther motorcycles|Panther motorcycle]] that left him in a critical condition for several days. His brother Neil had died at the same age. It was this near-death experience that was his catharsis and drove him to make the most of his talents and not let his abilities go to waste.&lt;ref&gt;D’Alpuget, Blanche (1982). “Robert .J. Hawke: A biography'', p. 31. Schwartz, Melbourne. ISBN 0867530014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/hawke/before-office.aspx.|title= Australia’s  Prime Ministers: Robert Hawke |date = 2014 |website = National Archives of Australia |accessdate= 7 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1956, Hawke married [[Hazel Hawke|Hazel Masterson]] at Perth Trinity Church.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Hurst, J., (1983), p.25&lt;/ref&gt; They would go on to have three children: Susan Pieters-Hawke (born 1957), Stephen (born 1959) and Roslyn (born 1960). Their fourth child, Robert Jr, died in his early infancy in 1963.  Hawke would later be named Victorian Father of the Year in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;D’Alpuget, Blanche (1982). “Robert .J. Hawke: A biography'', p. 197. Schwartz, Melbourne. ISBN 0867530014.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, Hawke accepted a scholarship to undertake doctoral studies in the area of arbitration law in the law department at the [[Australian National University]] in [[Canberra]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Soon after arrival at ANU, Hawke became the students' representative on the University Council.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

In 1957, Hawke was recommended to the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions|President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions]] (ACTU), Albert Monk, to become a research officer, replacing Harold Souter who had become ACTU Secretary. The recommendation was made by Hawke's mentor at ANU, H.P. Brown, who for a number of years had assisted the ACTU in national wage cases. Hawke decided to abandon his doctoral studies and accept the offer, moving to [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, J., (1983), p.26&lt;/ref&gt;

==ACTU President==
Not long after Hawke began work at the ACTU, he became responsible for the presentation of its annual case for higher wages to the national wages tribunal, the [[Australian Industrial Relations Commission|Conciliation and Arbitration Commission]]. He was first appointed as an ACTU advocate in 1959. The 1958 case, under advocate R.L. Eggleston, had yielded only a five-shilling increase.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst (1983), p.27&lt;/ref&gt; The 1959 case found for a fifteen-shilling increase, and was regarded as a personal triumph for Hawke.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst (1983), p.31&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to attain such success and prominence in his role as an ACTU advocate that, in 1969, he was encouraged to run for ACTU President, despite the fact that he had never held elected office in a trade union.

He was elected ACTU President in 1969 on a modernising platform, by a narrow margin of 399 to 350, with the support of the left of the union movement, including some associated with the [[Communist Party of Australia|Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, J., (1983), p.78&lt;/ref&gt; He later credited [[Ray Gietzelt]], General Secretary of the [[Federated Miscellaneous Workers' Union of Australia|FMWU]], as the single most significant union figure in helping him achieve this outcome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitedvoice.org.au/news/vale-ray-gietzelt United Voice, SMH Obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawke declared publicly that &quot;[[socialism|socialist]] is not a word I would use to describe myself&quot;, and his approach to government was [[pragmatism|pragmatic]]. He concerned himself with making improvements to workers' lives from within the traditional institutions of government, rather than by using any ideological theory. He opposed the [[Vietnam War]], but was a strong supporter of the US-Australian alliance, and also an emotional supporter of [[Israel]]. It was his commitment to the cause of Jewish [[Refuseniks]] that led to a planned assassination attempt on Hawke by the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]], and its Australian operative [[Munif Mohammed Abou Rish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/palestinian-plot-to-kill-hawke/2006/12/31/1167500010729.html |title=Terrorists plotted Hawke assassination: ASIO |publisher=Theage.com.au |date=31 December 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Hawke along with other members of the ACTU requested that [[South Africa]] send a non-racially biased team for the [[1971 South Africa rugby union tour of Australia|Rugby Union tour]], with the intention of unions agreeing not to serve the team in Australia. Prior to arrival, the Western Australian branch of the [[Transport Workers Union of Australia|Transport Workers Union]], and the Barmaids’ and Barmens’ Union announced that they would serve the team, which allowed the [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]]  to land in Perth. The tour commenced on June 26 and riots occurred as anti-apartheid protesters disrupted games. Hawke and his family started to receive malicious mail and phone calls from people who thought that sport and politics should not mix.  The harassment continued from anti-Semites, for his relationship with Israel. Hawke remained committed to the ban on apartheid teams and that same year, the South African cricket team was successfully denied and no apartheid team was to ever come to Australia again. It was this ongoing dedication to racial equality in South Africa that earned Hawke the respect and friendship of [[Nelson Mandela]].&lt;ref&gt;D’Alpuget, Blanche (1982). “Robert .J. Hawke: A biography'', p. 192. Schwartz, Melbourne. ISBN 0867530014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/fact-sheets/fs255.aspx|title= Australia and the issue of apartheid in sport |date = 2014 |website = National Archives of Australia |accessdate= 7 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solidarity.net.au/aboriginal/1971-springbok-tour-when-campaigners-scored-a-victory-against-racism/|title=1971 Springbok tour: When campaigners scored a victory against racism |date = 2011 |website= Solidarity Magazine |accessdate= 7 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In industrial matters, Hawke continued to demonstrate a preference for, and considerable skill at, negotiation, and was generally liked and respected by employers as well as the unions he advocated for. As early as 1972, speculation began that he would seek to enter [[Parliament of Australia|Parliament]] and eventually run to become the [[Australian Labor Party|Leader of the Labor Party]]. But while his professional career continued successfully, his heavy drinking and his notorious womanising placed considerable strains on his family life.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, G., et al. (1998), p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, Hawke was elected as the Labor Party's Federal President. Two years later, when the [[Gough Whitlam|Whitlam Government]] was controversially [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis|dismissed by the Governor-General]], Hawke showed an initial keenness to enter Parliament at the [[Australian federal election, 1975|ensuing election]]. [[Harry Jenkins, Sr.|Harry Jenkins]], the MP for [[Division of Scullin|Scullin]], came under pressure to step down to allow Hawke to stand in his place, but he strongly resisted this push.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary &quot;Labor stalwart who would not stand aside for Bob Hawke&quot;, ''The Age'', 6 August 2004, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Hawke eventually decided not to attempt to enter Parliament at that time, a decision he soon regretted. After Labor was defeated at the election, Whitlam initially offered the Labor leadership to Hawke, although it was not within Whitlam's power to decide who would succeed him.&lt;ref&gt;Hawke (1994), p.70&lt;/ref&gt; Despite not taking on the offer, Hawke remained influential, playing a key role in averting national strike action.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, J., (1983), p.198&lt;/ref&gt; The strain of this period took its toll, and in 1979 he suffered a physical collapse.

This shock led Hawke to make a sustained and ultimately successful effort to conquer his [[alcoholism]] – [[John Curtin]] was his inspiration in this, as in many other things. He was helped through this period by the relationship that he had established with the writer [[Blanche d'Alpuget]], who in 1982 published an admiring biography of Hawke. His popularity with the public was unaffected by this period of rehabilitation, and opinion polling suggested that he was a far more popular public figure than either Labor Leader [[Bill Hayden]] or [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Malcolm Fraser]].

==Member of Parliament==
[[File:Bob Hawke in 1980.jpg|thumb|upright|Hawke addresses the [[Labour Day]] crowd in October 1980]]
Hawke's first attempt to enter Parliament came during the [[Australian federal election, 1963|1963 federal election]]. He stood in the seat of [[Division of Corio|Corio]] and managed to achieve a 3.1% swing against the national trend, although he fell short of winning the seat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia/1963/1963repsvic.txt] {{Dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawke passed up several opportunities to enter Parliament throughout the 1970s, something he later wrote that he &quot;regretted&quot;. He eventually stood for election to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1980|1980 election]] for [[Division of Wills|Wills]], [[Melbourne]], winning comfortably. Immediately upon his election to Parliament, Hawke was appointed to the [[Shadow Cabinet]] by Labor Leader [[Bill Hayden]] as Shadow Minister for Industrial Relations, Employment and Youth.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, J., (1983), p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout that time, opinion polls continually indicated that, in contrast to Hayden, Hawke was regarded as &quot;a certain election winner&quot;. After losing the 1980 election, Hayden's position as leader was never completely secure. In order to quell this constant speculation over his position, Hayden eventually called a leadership ballot for 16 July 1982, believing that if he won he would be able to lead Labor into the next election.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), p.24&lt;/ref&gt; Hawke duly challenged Hayden, but Hayden was able to defeat him and remain in his position, although his five-vote victory over the former ACTU President was not large enough to dispel doubts that he could lead the Labor Party to victory at an election.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, J., (1983), p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being defeated, Hawke continued to agitate behind the scenes for a change in leadership, with opinion polls continuing to show that Hawke was a far more popular figure than both Hayden and [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Malcolm Fraser]]. Hayden's leadership position was thrown into further doubt after Labor performed poorly in a [[by-election]] in December 1982 for the Victorian seat of [[Division of Flinders|Flinders]], following the resignation of the former Liberal Minister [[Phillip Lynch|Sir Phillip Lynch]]. Labor needed a swing of 5.5% to win the seat, and had been predicted by the media to win, but could only achieve a swing of 3%.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Hurst, J., (1983), p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; This convinced many Labor MPs that only Hawke would be able to lead Labor to victory at the upcoming election. Labor Party power-brokers, such as [[Graham Richardson]] and [[Barrie Unsworth]], now openly switched their allegiance from Hayden to Hawke.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; More significantly, Hayden's staunch friend and political ally, Labor's [[Australian Senate|Senate Leader]] [[John Button]], eventually became convinced that Hawke's chances of victory at an election were greater than Hayden's. Having initially believed that he could carry on, Button's defection proved to be the final straw in convincing Hayden that he would have to resign as Labor Leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurst, J., 1983, p. 273&quot;&gt;Hurst, J., (1983), p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; Less than two months after the disastrous showing in Flinders, Hayden announced his resignation as Labor Leader to the caucus on 3 February 1983. Hawke was subsequently named Acting Leader—and hence [[Leader of the Opposition (Australia)|Leader of the Opposition]]—pending a party-room ballot at which he was elected unopposed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurst, J., 1983, p. 273&quot;/&gt; By a remarkable coincidence, on the same day that Hawke became Leader, Fraser called a [[Australian federal election, 1983|snap election]] for 5 March 1983, hoping to both capitalise on Labor's feuding before it could replace Hayden with Hawke.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst, J., (1983), p. 275&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser initially believed that he had caught Labor out, thinking that they would be forced to fight the election with Hayden as Leader.  However, he was surprised to find out that Hayden had already resigned that morning, literally hours before the writs were issued. In the election held a month later, Hawke led Labor to a landslide election victory, achieving a 24-seat swing—still the worst defeat that a sitting non-Labor government has ever suffered—and ending seven years of Liberal rule.

==Prime Minister==
{{Main|Hawke Government}}
After Labor's landslide win, Hawke was sworn in as the [[Prime Minister of Australia|23rd Prime Minister of Australia]] by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] on 11 March 1983. The inaugural days of the [[Hawke Government]] were distinctly different from those of the [[Whitlam Government]]. Rather than immediately initiating extensive reform programmes as Whitlam had, Hawke announced that [[Malcolm Fraser]]'s pre-election concealment of the budget deficit meant that many of Labor's election commitments would have to be deferred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelly, P., 1992, p.57&quot;&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), p.57&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his internal reforms package, Hawke divided the Government into two tiers, with only the most important ministers attending regular meetings of the [[Cabinet of Australia|Cabinet]]. The Labor caucus were still given the authority to determine who would make up the Ministry, but gave Hawke unprecedented powers for a Labor Prime Minister to select which individual ministers would comprise the 13-strong Cabinet.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), p.30&lt;/ref&gt; Hawke said that he did this in order to avoid what he viewed as the unwieldy nature of the Whitlam Cabinet, which had 27 members. Caucus under Hawke also exhibited a much more formalised system of parliamentary [[political faction|factions]], which significantly altered the dynamics of caucus operations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

[[Image:BannonHawke.jpg|right|thumb|Hawke presents a cheque for [[Ash Wednesday fires|Ash Wednesday]] fire relief to [[South Australia]]n [[Premier of South Australia|Premier]] [[John Bannon]] in April 1983.]]

Unlike his predecessor as Labor Leader, Hawke's authority within the Labor Party was absolute. This enabled him to persuade his MPs to support a substantial set of policy changes. Individual accounts from ministers indicate that while Hawke was not usually the driving force for economic reform – that impetus instead coming from [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] [[Paul Keating]] and [[Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources (Australia)|Industry Minister]] [[John Button]] – he took on the role of achieving consensus and providing political guidance on what was electorally feasible and how best to sell it to the public, tasks at which he proved highly successful. Hawke took on a very public role as Prime Minister, proving to be incredibly popular with the Australian electorate; to this date he still holds the highest ever AC Nielsen approval rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= The biggest hammering in history|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2008/05/19/1211182705614.html |work= Sydney Morning Herald|publisher= |date= 20 May 2008|accessdate=20 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political partnership between Hawke and his Treasurer, Paul Keating, provided essential to their success in government. The two men proved a study in contrasts: Hawke was a Rhodes Scholar; Keating left high school early.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J.,(1996), p.44&lt;/ref&gt; Hawke's enthusiasms were cigars, horse racing and all forms of sport; Keating preferred [[classical architecture]], [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]] symphonies and collecting [[British Regency|English Regency]] and [[First French Empire|French Empire]] antiques.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J.,(1996), p.6, p.48&lt;/ref&gt; Hawke was consensus-driven; Keating revelled in aggressive debate. Hawke was a lapsed Protestant; Keating was a practising Catholic. These differences, however, seemed only to increase the effectiveness of their partnership, as they oversaw sweeping economic and social changes throughout Australia.

According to political commentator [[Paul Kelly (journalist)|Paul Kelly]], &quot;the most influential economic decisions of the 1980s were the floating of the [[Australian dollar]] and the deregulation of the financial system&quot;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), p.76&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Malcolm Fraser|Fraser Government]] had played a part in the process of financial deregulation by commissioning the 1981 Campbell Report, opposition from Fraser himself had stalled the deregulation process.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), p.78&lt;/ref&gt; When the Hawke Government implemented a comprehensive program of financial deregulation and reform, it &quot;transformed economics and politics in Australia&quot;.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; The Australian economy became significantly more integrated with the global economy as a result, which completely transformed its relationship with [[Asia]], [[Europe]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; Both Hawke and Keating would claim the credit for being the driving force behind the success of the Australian Dollar float.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J.,(1996), pp.216–217&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other reforms, the Hawke Government dismantled the tariff system, privatised state sector industries, ended the subsidisation of loss-making industries, and sold off the state-owned [[Commonwealth Bank|Commonwealth Bank of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), p.665&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), p.672&lt;/ref&gt; The tax system was reformed, with the introduction of a fringe benefits tax and a capital gains tax, reforms strongly opposed by the Liberal Party at the time, but not ones that they reversed when they eventually returned to office.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), p.175&lt;/ref&gt; Partially offsetting these imposts upon the business community – the &quot;main loser&quot; from the 1985 Tax Summit according to Paul Kelly – was the introduction of full [[dividend imputation]], a reform insisted upon by Keating.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), p.174&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for schools was also considerably increased, while financial assistance was provided for students to enable them to stay at school longer. Considerable progress was also made in directing assistance &quot;to the most disadvantaged recipients over the whole range of welfare benefits.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ross McMullin, The Light on the Hill: The Australian Labor Party 1891-1991&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:PMs office at Old Parliament House December 2012.jpg|thumb|left|The Prime Minister's Office at Old Parliament House, preserved as it appeared during Hawke's Prime Ministership]]

Hawke benefited greatly from the disarray into which the Liberal Party fell after the resignation of Malcolm Fraser. The Liberals were divided between supporters of the dour, socially conservative [[John Howard]] and the more liberal, urbane [[Andrew Peacock]]. The arch-conservative [[Premier of Queensland]], [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]], added to the Liberals' problems with his &quot;[[Joh for Canberra]]&quot; campaign, which proved highly damaging. Exploiting these divisions, Hawke led the Labor Party to landslide election victories in a snap [[Australian federal election, 1984|1984 election]] and the [[Australian federal election, 1987|1987 election]].

Hawke's time as Prime Minister saw considerable friction develop between himself and the grassroots of the Labor Party, who were unhappy at what they viewed as Hawke's iconoclasm and willingness to cooperate with business interests. All Labor Prime Ministers have at times engendered the hostility of the organisational wing of the Party, but none more so than Hawke, who regularly expressed his willingness to cull Labor's &quot;sacred cows&quot;. The [[Socialist Left (Australia)|Socialist Left]] faction, as well as prominent Labor figure [[Barry Jones (Australian politician)|Barry Jones]], offered severe criticism of a number of government decisions. He also received criticism for his &quot;confrontationalist style&quot; in siding with the airlines in the [[1989 Australian pilots' strike]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), p.544&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hawke Reagan1985.jpg|right|thumb|Hawke and [[US President]] [[Ronald Reagan]] at the [[White House]] in 1985]]

In spite of the criticisms levelled against the Hawke Government, it succeeded in enacting a wide range of social reforms during its time in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/20943/20010718-0000/www.alp.org.au/about/achievements/index.html |title=Achievements of the Federal Labor Government - 1983-1986 |publisher=Pandora.nla.gov.au |date=23 August 2006 |accessdate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.unisa.edu.au/bhpml/speeches/Prime/policy.pdf] {{Dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deflecting arguments that the Hawke Government had failed as a reform government, [[Neville Wran]], [[John Dawkins]], [[Bill Hayden]] and [[Paul Keating]] made a number of speeches throughout the 1980s arguing that the Hawke Government had been a recognisably reformist government, drawing attention to Hawke's achievements as Prime Minister during his first five years in office. As well as the reintroduction of [[Medibank]], under the new name [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]], these included the doubling of child care places, the introduction of occupational superannuation, a boost in school retention rates, a focus on young people's job skills, a doubling of subsidised home care services, the elimination of poverty traps in the welfare system, a 50% increase in public housing funds, an increase in the real value of the old-age pension, the development of a new youth support program, the re-introduction of six-monthly indexation of single adult unemployment benefits, and significant improvements in social security provisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Whitlam, Wran and the Labor tradition: Labor history essays, volume two By Gough Whitlam, Australian Labor Party, New South Wales Branch&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://john.curtin.edu.au/jcmemlect/wran1986.html |title=Wran/1986 The Great Tradition-Labor Reform from Curtin to Hawke |publisher=John.curtin.edu.au |date= |accessdate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As pointed out by John Dawkins, the proportion of total government outlays allocated to families, the sick, single parents, widows, the handicapped, and veterans was significantly higher under the Hawke Government than under the Whitlam Government.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Another notable success for which Hawke's response is given considerable credit was [[HIV/AIDS in Australia|Australia's public health campaign]] regarding [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;For discussion see William Bowtell, ''Australia's Response to HIV/AIDS 1982–2005'', Lowy Institute for International Policy, May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In the later years of the Hawke Government, Aboriginal affairs also saw considerable attention, with an investigation of the idea of a treaty between Aborigines and the Government, although this idea would be overtaken by events, notably the [[Mabo v Queensland (No 2) (1992)|Mabo court decision]].

The Hawke Government also made some notable environmental decisions. In its first months in office it halted the construction of the [[Franklin Dam]] in [[Tasmania]], responding to a groundswell of protest about the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), p.528&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, with an election looming, tough political operator [[Graham Richardson]] was appointed Environment Minister, and was given the task of attracting second-preference votes from the [[Australian Democrats]] and other environmental parties. Richardson claimed this as a major factor in the government's narrow re-election at the [[Australian federal election, 1990|1990 election]].&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, G., (1994), pp. 276–277&lt;/ref&gt;

Richardson felt that the importance of his contribution to Labor's victory would automatically entitle him to the ministerial portfolio of his choice, which was Transport and Communications.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, G., (1994), p.281&lt;/ref&gt; He was shocked, however, at what he perceived as Hawke's ingratitude in allocating him Social Security instead. He later vowed in a telephone conversation with Peter Barron, a former Hawke staffer, to do &quot;whatever it takes&quot; to &quot;get&quot; Hawke.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelly, P., 1992, p.57&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, G., (1994), p.282&lt;/ref&gt; He immediately transferred his allegiance to [[Paul Keating]], who after seven years as [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] was openly coveting the leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, G., (1994), p.311&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Latham-Hawke.jpg|thumb|left|Bob Hawke and Labor Leader [[Mark Latham]] unveil a plaque in 2004 to commemorate the centenary of the [[Chris Watson|Watson Labor Government]] in 1904.]]

The [[late 1980s recession]] and accompanying high interest rates had seen the government in considerable electoral trouble, with many doubting if Hawke could win in 1990. Although Keating was the main architect of the government's economic policies, he took advantage of Hawke's declining popularity to plan a leadership challenge. In 1988, in the wake of poorer opinion polls, Keating put pressure on Hawke to step down immediately. Hawke responded by agreeing a secret deal with Keating, the so-called &quot;[[Kirribilli agreement|Kirribilli Agreement]]&quot;, that he would stand down in Keating's favour shortly after the 1990 election, which he convinced Keating he could win.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), p.454&lt;/ref&gt; Hawke duly won the 1990 election, albeit by a very tight margin, and subsequently appointed Keating as [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia|Deputy Prime Minister]] to replace the retiring [[Lionel Bowen]], and to prepare Keating to assume the leadership.

Not long after becoming Deputy Prime Minister, frustrated at the lack of any indication from Hawke as to when he might step down, Keating made a provocative speech to the [[Canberra Press Gallery|Federal Parliamentary Press Gallery]]. Hawke considered the speech extremely disloyal, and subsequently indicated to Keating that he would renege on the Kirribilli Agreement as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Hawke (1994), p.501. This was the speech in which Keating described himself as the 'Plácido Domingo' of Australian politics.&lt;/ref&gt; After this disagreement tensions between the two men reached an all-time high, and after a turbulent year, Keating finally resigned as Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer in June 1991, to challenge Hawke for the leadership. Hawke comfortably defeated Keating, and in a press conference after the result Keating declared that with regards the leadership, he had fired his &quot;one shot&quot;. Hawke appointed [[John Kerin]] to replace Keating as Treasurer, but Kerin quickly proved to be unequal to the job.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelly, P., 1992, pp.649–651&quot;&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), pp.649–651&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of his convincing win over Keating, Hawke was seen after the result as a &quot;wounded&quot; leader; he had now lost his long-term political partner, his rating in opinion polls began to decrease, and after nearly nine years as Prime Minister, many were openly speculating that he was &quot;tired&quot;, and that it was time for somebody new.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J., (1996), p.435&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawke's leadership was finally irrevocably damaged towards the end of 1991, as new [[Australian Liberal Party|Liberal Leader]] [[John Hewson]] released '[[Fightback! (policy)|Fightback!]]', a detailed proposal for sweeping economic change, including the introduction of a [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|goods and services tax]] and deep cuts to government spending and personal income tax.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelly, P., 1992, pp.649–651&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, P., (1992), pp.609–614&lt;/ref&gt; The package appeared to take Hawke by complete surprise, and his response to it was judged to be extremely ineffective. Many within the Labor Party appeared to lose faith in him over this, and Keating duly challenged for the leadership a second time on 19 December 1991, this time narrowly defeating Hawke by 56 votes to 51.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, J.,(1996), p.441&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] the following day, Hawke declared that his nine years as Prime Minister had left Australia a better country than he found, and he was given a standing ovation by those present. He subsequently tendered his resignation as Prime Minister to the Governor-General. Hawke briefly returned to the backbenches before resigning from Parliament on 20 February 1992, sparking a [[Wills by-election, 1992|by-election]] which was won by independent [[Phil Cleary]] from a record field of 22 candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/hawke/after-office.aspx |title=National Archive of Australia {{spaced ndash}}  Australia's Prime Ministers |publisher=Primeministers.naa.gov.au |date=20 February 1992 |accessdate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawke wrote that he had very few regrets over his time in office; although his bitterness towards Keating surfaced in his earlier memoirs, by 2010, Hawke said that he and Keating had long since buried their differences, and that they regularly dined together and considered each other friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/07/13/2302268.htm |title=Hawke and Keating bury the hatchet&amp;nbsp;– ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)|publisher=Abc.net.au |date=13 July 2008 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement and later life==
[[Image:Bob Hawke (8215440121).jpg|left|150px|thumb|Bob Hawke in 2012.]]
After leaving Parliament, Hawke entered the business world, taking on a number of directorships and consultancy positions, roles in which he was able to achieve considerable success. He and [[Hazel Hawke]] divorced in 1995; she had tolerated his open relationship with [[Blanche d'Alpuget]] whilst he was Prime Minister, but the marriage ended three years after his retirement from politics. Shortly afterwards, Hawke married d'Alpuget. Hazel Hawke died on 23 May 2013 following complications of [[Alzheimer's disease]].

Hawke deliberately had little involvement with the Labor Party during Keating's time as Prime Minister, not wanting to overshadow his successor, although he did occasionally criticise some of Keating's policies publicly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9111648/AUSTRALIA 1994 Year in Review&amp;nbsp;– Australia] [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] online&lt;/ref&gt; After Keating's defeat and the election of the [[John Howard|Howard Government]] at the [[Australian federal election, 1996|1996 election]], he began to be more involved with Labor again, and he has since regularly appeared at a number of official Labor launches and campaigns, often alongside Keating.

[[Image:HawkeSorry.jpg|right|thumb|Bob Hawke at [[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] for the national apology to the [[Stolen Generations]].]]

In the run up to the [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007 election]], Hawke made a considerable personal effort to support [[Kevin Rudd]], making speeches at a large number of campaign office openings across Australia. As well as campaigning against [[WorkChoices]], Hawke also attacked [[John Howard|John Howard's]] record as Treasurer, stating &quot;it was the judgement of every economist and international financial institution that it was the restructuring reforms undertaken by my government, with the full cooperation of the trade union movement, which created the strength of the Australian economy today&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/federalelection2007news/hawke-queries-record-of-man-who-buggered-the-economy/2007/10/24/1192941153265.html |title=Hawke queries record of man who 'buggered' the economy |publisher=The Age |date=24 October 2007 |accessdate=25 April 2010 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010]] and [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 campaigns]], Hawke lent considerable support to [[Julia Gillard]] and Kevin Rudd respectively. Hawke also maintained an involvement in Labor politics at a state level; in 2011, Hawke publicly supported [[Premier of New South Wales|NSW Premier]] [[Kristina Keneally]], who was facing almost certain defeat, in her campaign against Liberal [[Barry O'Farrell]], describing her campaign as &quot;gutsy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gutsy Hawke&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=ABC|first=News|title=Hawke praises Keneally's 'gutsy' Campaign|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-03-24/hawke-praises-keneallys-gutsy-campaign/2645056|accessdate=26 January 2012|newspaper=ABC News|date=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008, Hawke joined former Prime Ministers [[Gough Whitlam]], [[Malcolm Fraser]] and [[Paul Keating]] in [[Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] to witness Prime Minister Kevin Rudd deliver the long anticipated apology to the [[Stolen Generations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dylan |last=Welch |title=Kevin Rudd says sorry |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/prime-minister-kevin-rudd-made-today-an--historic-one-for-australia/2008/02/13/1202760342960.html |publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=13 February 2008 |accessdate=22 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Hawke helped establish the Centre for Muslim and Non-Muslim Understanding at the [[University of South Australia]]. Interfaith dialogue was an important issue for Hawke, who told the ''[[Adelaide Review]]'' that he is &quot;convinced that one of the great potential dangers confronting the world is the lack of understanding in regard to the Muslim world. Fanatics have misrepresented what Islam is. They give a false impression of the essential nature of Islam.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Ward, Amanda | title = World peace and a republic | work = [[Adelaide Review]] | issue = 358 | date = December 2009 | pages = 6–7 | url = http://www.adelaidereview.com.au/archives.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1259130386&amp;archive=1261450745&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=16&amp; | accessdate =14 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
