'''Alpha Centauri''' ([[Bayer designation|α Centauri]], α Cen; also known as '''Rigil Kent''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|aɪ|dʒ|əl|_|'|k|E|n|t}}—see [[#Names|Names]]) or '''Toliman''' is the brightest [[star]] in the southern [[constellation]] of [[Centaurus]] and the [[List of brightest stars|third brightest]] star in the night sky.&lt;ref&gt;http://interstellar.jpl.nasa.gov/interstellar/probe/introduction/neighborhood.html, Our Local Galactic Neighborhood, NASA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.centauri-dreams.org/?p=14203, Into the Interstellar Void, Centauri Dreams&lt;/ref&gt; The Alpha Centauri system is located 1.34 [[parsec]]s or 4.37 [[light year]]s from the Sun, making it the [[list of nearest stars|closest star system]] to our [[Solar System]].&lt;ref name=aaa341_121/&gt; Although it appears to the unaided eye as a single object, Alpha Centauri is actually a [[binary star]] [[star system|system]] (designated '''Alpha Centauri AB''' or '''α Cen AB''') whose combined [[Apparent magnitude|visual magnitude]] of −0.27 makes it the third brightest star (other than the [[Sun]]) seen from [[Earth]] after the −1.46 magnitude [[Sirius]] and the −0.72 magnitude [[Canopus]].

Its component stars are named Alpha Centauri A (α Cen A), with 110% of the mass and 151.9% the luminosity of the [[Sun]], and Alpha Centauri B (α Cen B), at 90.7% of the Sun's mass and 44.5% of its luminosity. During the pair's 79.91-year orbit about a common center, the distance between them varies from about that between [[Pluto]] and the Sun to that between [[Saturn]] and the Sun.

A third star, known as [[Proxima Centauri]], Proxima, or Alpha Centauri C (α Cen C), is probably gravitationally associated with Alpha Centauri AB. Proxima is at the slightly smaller distance of 1.29 [[parsec]]s or 4.24 [[light years]] from the Sun, making it the closest star to the Sun even though it is not visible to the naked eye. The separation of Proxima from Alpha Centauri AB is about 0.06 [[parsec]]s, 0.2 light years or 13,000 [[astronomical unit]]s (AU); equivalent to 400 times the size of [[Neptune]]'s orbit.

The system may also contain at least one planet, the Earth-sized [[Alpha Centauri Bb]], which, if confirmed, will be the closest known [[exoplanet]] to Earth. The planet has a mass at least 13% more than Earth's&lt;ref name = &quot;Wall&quot;/&gt; and orbits Alpha Centauri B with a period of 3.236 days.&lt;ref name = &quot;Dumusque&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dumusque |first1=X. |authorlink=

&quot;Alpha Centauri&quot; is the name given to what appears as a single [[star]] to the naked eye and the [[first magnitude star|brightest]] star in the southern constellation of [[Centaurus]]. At −0.27v [[Apparent magnitude|visual magnitude]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Robert | last=Burnham |date = 1978 |title = Burnham's Celestial Handbook |page = 549 |publisher = [[Courier Dover]] |isbn = 0-486-23567-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; it is fainter only than [[Sirius]] and [[Canopus]]. The next brightest star in the night sky is [[Arcturus]]. Actually a multiple star system, its two main stars are Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;A {{nowrap|(α Cen A)}} and Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;B {{nowrap|(α Cen B)}}, usually defined to identify them as the different components of the binary {{nowrap|α Cen AB}}. A third companion—[[Proxima Centauri]] (or Proxima or {{nowrap|α Cen C}})—has a distance much greater than the observed separation between stars A and&amp;nbsp;B and is probably gravitationally associated with the AB system. As viewed from Earth, it is located at an [[angular separation]] of 2.2° from the two main stars. If it were bright enough to be seen without a telescope, Proxima Centauri would appear to the naked eye as a star separate from {{nowrap|α Cen AB}}. Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;AB and Proxima Centauri form a ''[[double star|visual double]]'' star. Direct evidence that Proxima Centauri has an elliptical orbit typical of binary stars has yet to be found.&lt;ref name=&quot;wds2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last1=Mason | first1=B.D. |author2=Wycoff, G.L.

'''Alpha Centauri A''' is the principal member, or ''primary'', of the [[binary system (astronomy)|binary system]], being slightly larger and more luminous than the Sun.

'''Alpha Centauri B''' is the companion star, or ''secondary'', of the [[binary system (astronomy)|binary system]], and is slightly smaller and less luminous than the Sun.

Together, the bright visible components of the [[binary star]] system are called Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;AB {{nowrap|(α Cen AB)}}. This &quot;AB&quot; designation denotes the apparent gravitational centre of the main binary system relative to other companion star(s) in any [[Star system|multiple star system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DoubleStarsHeintz&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = Heintz | first=W. D. |date = 1978 |title = Double Stars |page = 19 |publisher = [[D. Reidel]] |isbn = 90-277-0885-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;AB-C&quot; refers to the orbit of Proxima around the central binary, being the distance between the centre of gravity and the outlying companion. Some older references use the confusing and now discontinued designation of&amp;nbsp;A×B. Since the distance between the Sun and Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;AB does not differ significantly from either star, gravitationally this binary system is considered as if it were one object.&lt;ref name=&quot;wds1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last = Worley | first=C.E. |author2=Douglass, G.G. |date = 1996 |title = Washington Visual Double Star Catalog, 1996.0 (WDS) |url = http://adc.gsfc.nasa.gov/adc-cgi/cat.pl?/catalogs/1/1237/ |publisher = [[United States Naval Observatory]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

South of about [[29th parallel south|29° S latitude]], Alpha Centauri is [[Circumpolar star|circumpolar]] and never sets below the horizon.&lt;ref&gt;This is calculated for a fixed latitude by knowing the star's [[declination]] (δ) using the formulae (90°+ δ). Alpha Centauri's declination is −60° 50′, so the latitude where the star is circumpolar will be south of −29° 10′S or 29°. Similarly, the place where Alpha Centauri never rises for northern observers is north of the latitude (90°+ δ) N or +29°N.&lt;/ref&gt; Both stars, including Crux, are too far south to be visible for mid-latitude northern observers. Below about [[29th parallel north|29° N latitude]] to the equator (roughly [[Hermosillo, Mexico|Hermosillo]], [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]] in Mexico, [[Galveston, Texas]], [[Ocala, Florida]] and [[Lanzarote]], [[Canary Islands|the Canary Islands]] of Spain) during the northern summer, Alpha Centauri lies close to the southern horizon.&lt;ref name=&quot;NortonSA&quot; /&gt; The star [[Culmination|culminates]] each year at midnight on 24 April or 9 p.m. on 8 June.&lt;ref name=&quot;NortonSA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.southastrodel.com/Page20502.htm | title='The '&quot;Constellations : Part 2 Culmination Times&quot;' | publisher=Southern Astronomical Delights | accessdate=2008-08-06 |author=James, Andrew |location=Sydney, New South Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observational history==
English explorer [[Robert Hues]] brought Alpha Centauri to the attention of European observers in his 1592 work ''Tractatus de Globis'', along with Canopus and [[Achernar]], noting &quot;Now, therefore, there are but three Stars of the first magnitude that I could perceive in all those parts which are never seene here in England. The first of these is that bright Star in the sterne of Argo which they call [[Canopus|Canobus]]. The [[Achernar|second]] is in the end of Eridanus. The third [Alpha Centauri] is in the right foote of the Centaure.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Knobel, p. 416.&lt;/ref&gt;

The binary nature of Alpha Centauri AB was first recognized in December 1689 by astronomer and Jesuit priest [[Jean Richaud]]. The finding was made incidentally while observing a passing [[comet]] from his station in [[Puducherry]]. Alpha Centauri was only the second binary star system to be discovered, preceded only by [[Alpha Crucis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;KameswaraRao1984&quot;&gt;

Alpha Centauri is the closest star system to the [[Solar System]]. It lies about 4.37 [[light-year]]s in distance, or about 41.5 trillion kilometres, 25.8 trillion miles or 277,600 AU. [[Scotland|Scottish]] astronomer [[Thomas Henderson (astronomer)|Thomas Henderson]] made the original discovery from many exacting observations of the trigonometric [[parallax]]es of the AB system between April 1832 and May 1833.

[[Scotland|Scottish]] astronomer [[Robert T. A. Innes|Robert Innes]] discovered [[Proxima Centauri]] in 1915 by blinking photographic plates taken at different times during a dedicated [[proper motion]] survey. This showed the large proper motion and parallax of the star was similar in both size and direction to those of Alpha Centauri AB, suggesting immediately it was part of the system and slightly closer to us than Alpha Centauri AB. Lying 4.24 light-years away, Proxima Centauri is the [[List of nearest stars|nearest star]] to the Sun. All current derived distances for the three stars are from the [[parallax]]es obtained from the [[Hipparcos]] star catalog (HIP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Proxima is an M5.5&amp;nbsp;V [[spectral class]] red dwarf with an [[absolute magnitude]] of +15.53, which is only a small fraction of the Sun's luminosity. By mass, Proxima is calculated as {{Solar mass|0.123 ± 0.06}} (rounded to {{Solar mass|0.12}}) or about one-eighth that of the Sun.&lt;ref name=&quot;aaa397&quot;&gt;

All components of Alpha Centauri display significant [[proper motion]]s against the background sky, similar to the first magnitude stars [[Sirius]] and [[Arcturus]]. Over the centuries, this causes the apparent stellar positions to slowly change. Such motions define the ''high-proper-motion stars''.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Image:Motion-of-Alpha-Cen.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Apparent motion of Alpha Centauri relative to [[Beta Centauri]]]]
Based on these observed proper motions and radial velocities, Alpha Centauri will continue to gradually brighten, passing just north of the [[Southern Cross]] or [[Crux]], before moving northwest and up towards the [[celestial equator]] and away from the [[galactic plane]]. By about 29,700&amp;nbsp;[[AD]], in the present-day constellation of [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]], Alpha Centauri will be 1.00&amp;nbsp;[[parsec|pc]] or 3.26&amp;nbsp;[[light-year|ly]] away.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthews&quot;/&gt; Then it will reach the stationary radial velocity (RVel) of 0.0&amp;nbsp;km/s and the maximum apparent magnitude of −0.86V (which is comparable to present-day magnitude of [[Canopus]]).  However, even during the time of this nearest approach, the apparent magnitude of Alpha Centauri will still not surpass that of [[Sirius]] (which will brighten incrementally over the next 60,000 years, and will continue to be the brightest star as seen from Earth for the next 210,000 years).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sky and Telescope]]'', April 1998 (p60), based on computations from [[HIPPARCOS]] data.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alpha Centauri system will then begin to move away from the Solar System, showing a positive radial velocity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthews&quot;/&gt; Due to visual [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]], about 100,000&amp;nbsp;years from now, these stars will reach a final [[vanishing point]] and slowly disappear among the countless stars of the Milky Way. Here this once bright yellow star will fall below naked-eye visibility somewhere in the faint present day southern constellation of [[Telescopium]] (this unusual location results from the fact that Alpha Centauri's orbit around the galactic centre is highly tilted with respect to the plane of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy).&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthews&quot;/&gt;

==Apparent movement==
In about 4000 years, the [[proper motion]] of Alpha Centauri will mean that from the point of view of Earth it will appear close enough to [[Beta Centauri]] to form an optical [[double star]]. Beta Centauri is in reality far more distant than Alpha Centauri.

==Planets==
Until the 1990s, technologies did not exist that could detect planets outside the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lackofany&quot; /&gt; However, some exoplanets may be orbiting the Alpha Centauri system.

===Possibility of additional planets===
The discovery of [[exoplanet|planets orbiting other star systems]], including similar binary systems ([[Gamma Cephei]]), raises the possibility that additional planets may exist in the Alpha Centauri system. Such planets could orbit Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;A or Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;B individually, or be on large orbits around the binary Alpha Centauri AB. Since both the principal stars are fairly similar to the Sun (for example, in age and [[metallicity]]), astronomers have been especially interested in making detailed searches for planets in the Alpha Centauri system. Several established planet-hunting teams have used various [[radial velocity]] or star [[Astronomical transit|transit]] methods in their searches around these two bright stars.&lt;ref name=&quot;universetoday.com&quot;&gt;

In 2009, computer simulations (then unaware of the close-in planet Bb) showed that a planet might have been able to form near the inner edge of Alpha Centauri B's habitable zone, which extends from 0.5 to 0.9 AU from the star. Certain special assumptions, such as considering that Alpha Centauri A and B may have initially formed with a wider separation and later moved closer to each other (as might be possible if they formed in a dense [[Open cluster|star cluster]]) would permit an accretion-friendly environment farther from the star.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thebault 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would be discounted if, for example, Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;B happened to have gas giants orbiting Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;A (or conversely, Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;A for Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;B), or if the stars B and A themselves were able to successfully perturb comets into each other's inner system as Jupiter and Saturn presumably have done in the Solar System. Because icy bodies probably also reside in [[Oort cloud]]s of other planetary systems, when they are influenced gravitationally by either the gas giants or disruptions by passing nearby stars many of these icy bodies then travel starwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthews&quot; /&gt; There is no direct evidence yet of the existence of such an Oort cloud around Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;AB, and theoretically this may have been totally destroyed during the system's formation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Matthews&quot; /&gt;

To be in the star's [[habitable zone]], any suspected Earth-like planet around Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;A would have to be placed about 1.25&amp;nbsp;[[astronomical unit|AU]] away&amp;nbsp;{{Citation needed|reason=habitable zones are supposed to be a range rather than a specific distance, is 1.25 AU just the distance where the energy from the Sun would be identical to Earth?

With the goal of finding evidence of such planets, both Proxima Centauri and Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;AB were among the listed &quot;Tier&amp;nbsp;1&quot; target stars for [[NASA]]'s [[Space Interferometry Mission]] (SIM).

==View from this system==
[[File:Sol View from AlpCenA.png|thumb|300px|Looking toward the [[Sun]] from Alpha Centauri in [[Celestia]]]]

[[File:Sky-from-alpha-centauri.jpg|thumb|300px|Looking toward the sky around Orion from Alpha Centauri with [[Sirius]] near [[Betelgeuse]] and the [[Sun]] between [[Perseus]] and [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]] generated by [[Celestia]]]]

Viewed from near the Alpha Centauri system, the sky would appear very much as it does for earthbound observers, except that Centaurus would be missing its brightest star. The Sun would be a yellow +0.5 visual magnitude star in eastern [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]] at the [[antipodal point]] of Alpha Centauri's current [[right ascension|RA]] and [[declination|Dec.]] at {{RA|02|39|35}} {{DEC|+60|50}} (2000). This place is close to the 3.4 magnitude star [[Epsilon Cassiopeiae|ε Cassiopeiae]]. An interstellar or alien observer would find the \/\/ of Cassiopeia had become a /\/\/ shape &lt;ref&gt;The coordinates of the Sun would be diametrically opposite Alpha Centauri AB, at ''α''={{RA|02|39|36.4951}}, ''δ''={{DEC|+60|50|02.308}}&lt;/ref&gt; nearly in front of the [[Heart Nebula]] in Cassiopeia. [[Sirius]] lies less than a degree from [[Betelgeuse]] in the otherwise unmodified [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] and is with −1.2 a little fainter than from Earth but still the brightest star in the Alpha Centauri sky. [[Procyon]] is also displaced into the middle of [[Gemini (constellation)|Gemini]], outshining [[Pollux (star)|Pollux]], while both [[Vega]] and [[Altair]] are shifted northwestward relative to [[Deneb]] (which barely moves, due to its great distance)- giving the [[Summer Triangle]] a more [[equilateral]] appearance.

From Proxima itself, Alpha Centauri AB would appear like two close bright stars with the combined magnitude of −6.8. Depending on the binary's orbital position, the bright stars would appear noticeably divisible to the naked eye, or occasionally, but briefly, as single unresolved star. Based on the calculated [[absolute magnitude]]s, the [[visual magnitude]]s of Alpha Centauri A and B would be −6.5 and −5.2, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Computed; using in solar terms: {{Solar mass|1.1}} and {{Solar mass|0.92}}, luminosities 1.57 and 0.51&amp;nbsp;''L''*/{{Solar luminosity}}, Sun magnitude −26.73(v), 11.2 to 35.6 AU orbit; The minimum luminosity adds planet's orbital radius to A–B distance (max) (conjunction). Max. luminosity subtracts the planet's orbital radius to A–B distance (min) (opposition).&lt;/ref&gt;

===View from a hypothetical planet===
[[File:Planet-alphacen1.png|thumb|300px|Artist's rendition of the view from a hypothetical airless planet orbiting Alpha Centauri A]]
An observer on a hypothetical planet orbiting around either Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;A or Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;B would see the other star of the binary system as an intensely bright object in the night sky, showing a small but discernible disk.

For example, some theoretical Earth-like planet orbiting about 1.25 AU from Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;A (so that the star appears roughly as bright as the Sun viewed from the Earth) would see Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;B orbit the entire sky once roughly every one year and three months (or 1.3(4) [[year|a]]), the planet's own [[orbital period]]. Added to this would be the changing apparent position of Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;B during its long eighty-year elliptical orbit with respect to Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;A (comparable in speed to [[Uranus]] here). Depending on the position on its orbit, Alpha Centauri B would vary in apparent magnitude between −18.2 (dimmest) and −21.0 (brightest). These visual magnitudes are much dimmer than the observed −26.7 [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] for the Sun as viewed from the Earth. The difference of 5.7 to 8.6 magnitudes means Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;B would appear, on a linear scale, 2500 to 190 times dimmer than Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;A (or the Sun viewed from the Earth), but also 190 to 2500 times brighter than the −12.5 magnitude full [[Moon]] as seen from the Earth.

Also, if another similar Earth-like planet orbited at 0.71&amp;nbsp;AU from Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;B (so that in turn Alpha Centauri B appeared as bright as the Sun seen from the Earth), this hypothetical planet would receive slightly more light from the more luminous Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;A, which would shine 4.7 to 7.3 magnitudes dimmer than Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;B (or the Sun seen from the Earth), ranging in apparent magnitude between −19.4 (dimmest) and −22.1 (brightest). Thus Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;A would appear between 830 and 70 times dimmer than the Sun but some 580 to 6900 times brighter than the full Moon. During such planet's orbital period of 0.6(3) [[year|a]], an observer on the planet would see this intensely bright companion star circle the sky just as we see with the [[Solar System]]'s planets. Furthermore, Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;A [[orbital period|sidereal period]] of approximately eighty years means that this star would move through the local [[ecliptic]] as slowly as [[Uranus]] with its eighty-four year period, but as the orbit of Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;A is more elliptical, its apparent magnitude will be far more variable. Although intensely bright to the eye, the overall illumination would not significantly affect climate nor influence normal plant [[photosynthesis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Croswell&quot;/&gt;

An observer on the hypothetical planet would notice a change in orientation to [[very-long-baseline interferometry|VLBI]] reference points commensurate with the binary orbit periodicity plus or minus any local effects such as [[precession]] or [[nutation]].

Assuming this hypothetical planet had a low orbital inclination with respect to the mutual orbit of Alpha Centauri&amp;nbsp;A and B, then the secondary star would start beside the primary at 'stellar' [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]]. Half the period later, at 'stellar' [[Opposition (astronomy and astrology)|opposition]], both stars would be opposite each other in the sky. Then, for about half the planetary year the appearance of the night sky would be a darker blue&amp;nbsp;– similar to the sky during totality at any total [[solar eclipse]]. Humans could easily walk around and clearly see the surrounding terrain, and reading a book would be quite possible without any artificial light.&lt;ref name=&quot;Croswell&quot; /&gt; After another half period in the stellar orbit, the stars would complete their orbital cycle and return to the next stellar conjunction, and the familiar Earth-like day and night cycle would return.

==Use in modern fiction==
{{Main|Alpha Centauri in fiction}}
Alpha Centauri's relative proximity makes it in some ways the logical choice as &quot;first port of call&quot;. [[Speculative fiction]] about [[interstellar travel]] often predicts eventual human [[space exploration|exploration]], and even the [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]] and [[space colonization|colonization]] of [[planetary system]]s. These themes are common to many works of [[science fiction]] and [[video game]]s.
