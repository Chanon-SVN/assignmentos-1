'''Aspirin''' ([[British Approved Name|BAN]], [[United States Adopted Name|USAN]]), also known as '''acetylsalicylic acid''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˌ|s|iː|t|əl|ˌ|s|æ|l|ɨ|ˈ|s|ɪ|l|ɨ|k}} {{respell|ə|SEE|təl|SAL|i|SIL|ik}}) ['''ASA'''], is a [[salicylate]] [[medication|drug]], often used as an [[analgesic]] to relieve minor aches and pains, as an [[antipyretic]] to reduce fever, and as an [[anti-inflammatory]] medication.&lt;ref name = MD/&gt; Aspirin also has an [[Antiplatelet drug|antiplatelet]] effect by inhibiting the production of [[thromboxane]], which under normal circumstances binds [[platelet]] molecules together to create a patch over damaged walls of blood vessels. Because the platelet patch can become too large and also block blood flow, locally and downstream, aspirin is also used long-term, at low doses, to help prevent [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], [[stroke]]s, and [[thrombus|blood clot]] formation in people at high risk of developing blood clots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lewis | first1 = H.

The main [[adverse drug reaction|side effects]] of aspirin are [[gastrointestinal]] [[gastric ulcer|ulcers]], stomach bleeding, and [[tinnitus|ringing in the ears]], especially with higher doses. In children and adolescents, aspirin is not recommended for [[flu-like symptoms]] or viral illnesses, because of the risk of [[Reye's syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BMJ2002-Macdonald&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Macdonald S|title=Aspirin use to be banned in under 16-year olds|journal=BMJ|volume=325|issue=7371|page=988|year=2002|pmid= 12411346 |pmc=1169585|doi=10.1136/bmj.325.7371.988/c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspirin is part of a group of medications called [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] (NSAIDs), but differs from most other NSAIDs in the [[nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs#Mechanism of action|mechanism of action]]. Though it and others with similar structure, called the salicylates, have similar effects (antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic) to the other NSAIDs and inhibit the same enzyme [[cyclooxygenase]] (COX), aspirin does so in an [[irreversible inhibition|irreversible]] manner and, unlike others, affects more the COX-1 variant than the COX-2 variant of the enzyme.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodman and Gilman's&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Burke |first=Anne |last2=Smyth |first2=Emer |last3=FitzGerald |first3=Garret A. |chapter=26: Analgesic Antipyretic and Antiinflammatory Agents |title=Goodman and Gilman's the pharmacological basis of therapeutics |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2006 |edition=11 |isbn=978-0-07-142280-2 |location=New York |pages=671–716 |url=http://www.accessmedicine.com/content.aspx?aID=942410&amp;searchStr=aspirin}} {{Dead link|date=May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The active ingredient of aspirin was first discovered from the bark of the willow tree in 1763 by [[Edward Stone (clergyman)|Edward Stone]] of [[Wadham College]], [[University of Oxford]].

====Headache====
Aspirin, either by itself or in a combined formulation, effectively treats some [[Headache#Classification|types of headache]], but its efficacy may be questionable for others. Secondary headaches, meaning those caused by another disorder or trauma, should be promptly treated by a medical provider.

Among primary headaches, the [[International Classification of Headache Disorders]] distinguishes between [[tension headache]] (the most common), migraine, and [[cluster headache]]. Aspirin or other over-the-counter analgesics are widely recognized as effective for the treatment of tension headache.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loder|first1=E|author2=Rizzoli, P|title=Tension-type headache|journal=BMJ (Clinical research ed.)|date=12 January 2008 | volume=336 | issue=7635 | pages=88–92 | pmid=18187725 | doi=10.1136/bmj.39412.705868.AD|pmc=2190284}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Aspirin, especially as a component of an acetaminophen/aspirin/caffeine formulation, ''e.g.'', [[Excedrin]] Migraine, is considered a first-line therapy in the treatment of migraine, and comparable to lower doses of [[sumatriptan]]. It is most effective at stopping migraines when they are first beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gilmore|first1=B|author2=Michael, M|title=Treatment of acute migraine headache|journal=American family physician|date=1 February 2011|volume=83|issue=3|pages=271–80|pmid=21302868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fever===
Like its ability to control pain, aspirin's ability to control [[fever]] is due to its action on the [[prostaglandin]] system through its irreversible inhibition of [[COX]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bartfai|first1=T|author2=Conti, B|title=Fever|journal=TheScientificWorldJournal|date=16 March 2010|volume=10|pages=490–503|doi=10.1100/tsw.2010.50|pmid=20305990|pmc=2850202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although aspirin's use as an [[antipyretic]] in adults is well-established, many medical societies and regulatory agencies (including the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]], the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]], and the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) strongly advise against using aspirin for treatment of fever in children because of the risk of [[Reye's syndrome]], a rare but often fatal illness associated with the use of aspirin or other salicylates in children during episodes of viral or bacterial infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pugliese|first1=A|author2=Beltramo, T; Torre, D|title=Reye's and Reye's-like syndromes|journal=Cell biochemistry and function|date=October 2008|volume=26|issue=7|pages=741–6|pmid=18711704|doi=10.1002/cbf.1465}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beutler|first1=AI|author2=Chesnut, GT; Mattingly, JC; Jamieson, B|title=FPIN's Clinical Inquiries.

===Swelling and inflammation===
Aspirin is used as an anti-inflammatory agent for both acute and long-term inflammation,&lt;ref&gt;Thea Morris, Melanie Stables, Adrian Hobbs, Patricia de Souza, Paul Colville-Nash, Tim Warner, Justine Newson, Geoffrey Bellingan, and Derek W. Gilroy, [http://www.jimmunol.org/content/183/3/2089.full.pdf &quot;Effects of Low-Dose Aspirin on Acute Inflammatory Responses in Humans&quot;], ''J. Immunology'', 183: 2089-2096, 2009 (accessed Aug 29, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;ref name=AHFS /&gt;

===Heart attacks and strokes===
The first studies of the effect of aspirin on cardiac function and stroke prevention was carried out by Professor [[Peter Sleight]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theheart.org/fr/documents/satellite_programs/prevention/791993/biography/sleight.html&lt;/ref&gt; Emeritus Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at [[Oxford University]] in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/research-confirms-and-points-to-future-aspirin-uses-for-disease-prevention-75958547.html |title=Research Confirms and Points to Future Aspirin Uses For Disease Prevention – re&gt; BERLIN, Dec. 1 /PRNewswire/ |publisher=Prnewswire.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sleight and his research team at Oxford led the way and formed the foundation for the research into the use of aspirin in the prevention of other medical conditions.

For a subset of the population, aspirin may help [[Preventive medicine|prevent]] heart attacks and strokes. In lower doses, aspirin has been known to prevent the progression of existing cardiovascular disease, and reduce the frequency of these events for those with a history of them.&lt;ref name=pmid20112887&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hall|first1=SL|author2=Lorenc, T|title=Secondary prevention of coronary artery disease|journal=American family physician|date=1 February 2010|volume=81|issue=3|pages=289–96|pmid=20112887}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19482214&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Baigent C |title=Aspirin in the primary and secondary prevention of vascular disease: collaborative meta-analysis of individual participant data from randomised trials |journal=Lancet |volume=373 |issue=9678 |pages=1849–60 |year=2009 |pmid=19482214 |pmc=2715005 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60503-1|author-separator=,|author2=Blackwell L|author3=Collins R|last4=Collins|first4=R|last5=Emberson|first5=J|last6=Godwin|first6=J|last7=Peto|first7=R|last8=Buring|first8=J|last9=Hennekens|first9=C|first10=P|first11=T|first14=A}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This is known as secondary prevention.)

Aspirin appears to offer little benefit to those at lower risk of heart attack or stroke—for instance, those without a history of these events or with pre-existing disease. (This is called primary prevention.) Some studies recommend aspirin on a case-by-case basis,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19293073&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wolff|first1=T|author2=Miller, T; Ko, S|title=Aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events: an update of the evidence for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|date=17 March 2009|volume=150|issue=6|pages=405–10|pmid=19293073|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-150-6-200903170-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;USPSTF aspirin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. Preventive Services Task Force|title=Aspirin for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease: Recommendation Statement|url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspsasmi.htm|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others have suggested the risks of other events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, were significant enough to outweigh any potential benefit, and recommended against using aspirin for primary prevention entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berger|first1=JS|author2=Lala, A, Krantz, MJ, Baker, GS, Hiatt, WR|title=Aspirin for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients without clinical cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis of randomized trials|journal=American heart journal|date=July 2011|volume=162|issue=1|pages=115–24.e2|pmid=21742097|doi=10.1016/j.ahj.2011.04.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complicating the use of aspirin for prevention is the phenomenon of aspirin resistance.&lt;ref name=pmid16364973&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=TH|author2=Bhatt, DL; Topol, EJ|title=Aspirin and clopidogrel resistance: an emerging clinical entity|journal=European heart journal|date=March 2006|volume=27|issue=6|pages=647–54|pmid=16364973|doi=10.1093/eurheartj/ehi684}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid20944898&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oliveira|first1=DC|author2=Silva, RF; Silva, DJ; Lima, VC|title=Aspirin resistance: fact or fiction?|journal=Arquivos brasileiros de cardiologia|date=September 2010|volume=95|issue=3|pages=e91–4|pmid=20944898|doi=10.1590/S0066-782X2010001300024}}&lt;/ref&gt; For patients who are resistant, aspirin's efficacy is reduced, which can cause an increased risk of stroke.&lt;ref name=pmid21306212&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Topçuoglu|first1=MA|author2=Arsava, EM; Ay, H|title=Antiplatelet resistance in stroke|journal=Expert Review of Neurotherapeutics|date=February 2011|volume=11|issue=2|pages=251–63|pmid=21306212|doi=10.1586/ern.10.203|pmc=3086673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some authors have suggested testing regimens to identify those patients who are resistant to aspirin or other antithrombotic drugs (such as [[clopidogrel]]).&lt;ref name=pmid19576352&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ben-Dor|first1=I|author2=Kleiman, NS; Lev, E|title=Assessment, mechanisms, and clinical implication of variability in platelet response to aspirin and clopidogrel therapy|journal=The American journal of cardiology|date=15 July 2009|volume=104|issue=2|pages=227–33|pmid=19576352|doi=10.1016/j.amjcard.2009.03.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspirin has also been suggested as a component of a [[polypill]]&lt;ref name=pmid16100022&gt;{{cite journal|last=Norris|first=JW|title=Antiplatelet agents in secondary prevention of stroke: a perspective|journal=Stroke; a journal of cerebral circulation|date=September 2005|volume=36|issue=9|pages=2034–6|pmid=16100022|doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000177887.14339.46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid16603580&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sleight|first1=P|author2=Pouleur, H; Zannad, F|title=Benefits, challenges, and registerability of the polypill|journal=European heart journal|date=July 2006|volume=27|issue=14|pages=1651–6|pmid=16603580|doi=10.1093/eurheartj/ehi841}}&lt;/ref&gt; for prevention of cardiovascular disease.

===After surgery===
After [[percutaneous coronary intervention]]s (PCIs), such as the placement of a [[coronary artery]] [[stent]], a U.S. [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Guideline Clearinghouse (NGC)|title=2011 ACCF/AHA/SCAI guideline for percutaneous coronary artery intervention. A report of the American College of Cardiology Foundation/American Heart Association Task Force on Practice Guidelines and the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions.|url=http://www.guideline.gov/content.aspx?id=34980|publisher=United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ)|accessdate=28 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently, aspirin is combined with an [[ADP receptor inhibitor]], such as [[clopidogrel]], [[prasugrel]], or [[ticagrelor]] to prevent [[thrombosis|blood clots]]. This is called dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). United States and European Union guidelines disagree somewhat about how long, and for what indications this combined therapy should be continued after surgery. U.S. guidelines recommend DAPT for at least 12 months, while EU guidelines recommend DAPT for 6–12 months after a drug-eluting stent placement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Musumeci|first1=G|author2=Di Lorenzo, E; Valgimigli, M|title=Dual antiplatelet therapy duration: what are the drivers?|journal=Current Opinion in Cardiology|date=December 2011|volume=26 Suppl 1|pages=S4–14|pmid=22129582|doi=10.1097/01.hco.0000409959.11246.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they agree that aspirin be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete.

===Other uses===
Aspirin is a first-line treatment for the fever and joint-pain symptoms of [[rheumatic fever|acute rheumatic fever]]. The therapy often lasts for one to two weeks, and is rarely indicated for longer periods. After fever and pain have subsided, the aspirin is no longer necessary, since it does not decrease the incidence of heart complications and residual rheumatic heart disease.&lt;ref name=NHFA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racgp.org.au/Content/NavigationMenu/ClinicalResources/RACGPGuidelines/DiagnosisandmanagementofacuterheumaticfeverandrheumaticheartdiseaseinAustralia/NHFA-CSANZ_ARF_RHD_2006.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080726052030/http://www.racgp.org.au/Content/NavigationMenu/ClinicalResources/RACGPGuidelines/DiagnosisandmanagementofacuterheumaticfeverandrheumaticheartdiseaseinAustralia/NHFA-CSANZ_ARF_RHD_2006.pdf|archivedate=2008-07-26|title=Diagnosis and management of acute rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease in Australia.

===Resistance===
For some people, aspirin does not have as strong an effect on platelets as for others, an effect known as aspirin resistance or insensitivity.

===Dosage===
[[File:Regular strength enteric coated aspirin tablets.jpg|thumb|Coated 325-mg aspirin tablets]]
Adult aspirin tablets are produced in standardised sizes, which vary slightly from country to country, for example 300&amp;nbsp;mg in Britain and 325&amp;nbsp;mg in the United States. Smaller doses are based on these standards, ''e.g.'', 75-mg and 81-mg tablets. The 81-mg tablets are called &quot;baby-strength&quot;, though they are not intended to be administered to infants and children. No medical significance occurs due to the slight difference in dosage between the 75-mg and the 81-mg tablets. Of historic interest, in the United States, a 325-mg dose is equivalent to the historic 5-[[Grain (unit)|grain]] aspirin tablet in use prior to the metric system.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014|reason=whole paragraph needs sources, but especially the historic interest note}}

In general, for adults, doses are taken four times a day for fever or arthritis,&lt;ref name=BNF&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[British National Formulary]]|edition=45|year=2003|publisher= [[British Medical Journal]] and [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with doses near the maximal daily dose used historically for the treatment of rheumatic fever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/druginfo/monograph?cid=med&amp;drugid=3881&amp;drugname=Aspirin+EC+Oral&amp;monotype=monograph |title=Aspirin monograph: dosages, etc |publisher=Medscape.com |accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) in someone with documented or suspected coronary artery disease, much lower doses are taken once daily.&lt;ref name=BNF /&gt;

Recommendations from the USPSTF&lt;ref&gt;(USPSTF, March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; on the use of aspirin for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease encourage men aged 45–79 and women aged 55–79 to use aspirin when the potential benefit of a reduction in MI for men or stroke for women outweighs the potential harm of an increase in gastrointestinal hemorrhage.&lt;ref name=medscape&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cme.medscape.com/viewarticle/589895?src=cmemp |title=Aspirin: More Evidence That Low Dose Is All That Is Needed (from Medscape) |publisher=Cme.medscape.com |accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WHI study said regular low-dose (75- or 81-mg) aspirin female users had a 25% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease and a 14% lower risk of death from any cause.&lt;ref name=medscape /&gt; Low-dose aspirin use was also associated with a trend toward lower risk of cardiovascular events, and lower aspirin doses (75 or 81&amp;nbsp;mg/day) may optimize efficacy and safety for patients requiring aspirin for long-term prevention.&lt;ref name=medscape /&gt;

In children with Kawasaki disease, aspirin is taken at dosages based on body weight, initially four times a day for up to two weeks and then at a lower dose once daily for a further six to eight weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[British National Formulary for Children]]|year=2006|publisher= [[British Medical Journal]] and [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to enteric coating, &quot;buffering&quot; is the other main method companies have used to try to mitigate the problem of gastrointestinal bleeding. Buffering agents are intended to work by preventing the aspirin from concentrating in the walls of the stomach, although the benefits of buffered aspirin are disputed. Almost any buffering agent used in antacids can be used; Bufferin, for example, uses [[magnesium oxide]]. Other preparations use [[calcium carbonate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/acidbase/faq/buffered-aspirin.shtml |title=General Chemistry Online: FAQ: Acids and bases: What is the buffer system in buffered aspirin? |publisher=Antoine.frostburg.edu |accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central effects===

===Reye's syndrome===
{{Main|Reye's syndrome}}
Reye's syndrome, a rare but severe illness characterized by acute [[encephalopathy]] and [[fatty liver]], can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illnesses or infections. From 1981 through 1997, 1207 cases of Reye's syndrome in under-18 patients were reported to the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]. Of these, 93% reported being ill in the three weeks preceding onset of Reye's syndrome, most commonly with a [[Respiratory tract infection (disambiguation)|respiratory infection]], [[chickenpox]], or [[diarrhea]]. Salicylates were detectable in 81.9% of children for whom test results were reported.&lt;ref name=Belay&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Belay ED, Bresee JS, Holman RC, Khan AS, Shahriari A, Schonberger LB |title=Reye's syndrome in the United States from 1981 through 1997 |journal=N.

===Hives and swelling===
For a small number of people, taking aspirin can result in symptoms resembling an allergic reaction, including [[hives]], swelling, and headache. The reaction is caused by [[salicylate intolerance]] and is not a true [[allergy]], but rather an inability to metabolize even small amounts of aspirin, resulting in an [[#Overdose|overdose]].

===Other adverse effects===
Aspirin can induce [[angioedema|swelling of skin tissues]] in some people. In one study, angioedema appeared one to six hours after ingesting aspirin in some of the patients. However, when the aspirin was taken alone, it did not cause angioedema in these patients; the aspirin had been taken in combination with another NSAID-induced drug when angioedema appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Berges-Gimeno MP &amp; Stevenson DD |year=2004 |title=Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced reactions and desensitization |journal=J Asthma |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=375–84 |pmid=15281324 |doi=10.1081/JAS-120037650}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspirin and other NSAIDs can cause [[hyperkalemia]] by inducing a [[hyporenin hypoaldosteronic state]] via inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis; however, these agents do not typically cause hyperkalemia by themselves in the setting of normal renal function and euvolemic state.&lt;ref&gt;Medical knowledge self-assessment program for students 4, By American College of Physicians, Clerkship Directors in Internal Medicine, Nephrology 227, Item 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspirin can cause prolonged bleeding after operations for up to 10 days. In one study, 30 of 6499 elective surgical patients required reoperations to control bleeding. Twenty had diffuse bleeding and 10 had bleeding from a site. Diffuse, but not discrete, bleeding was associated with the preoperative use of aspirin alone or in combination with other NSAIDS in 19 of the 20 diffuse bleeding patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Scher, K.S. |year=1996 |title=Unplanned reoperation for bleeding |journal=Am Surg |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=52–55 |pmid=8540646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overdose===
{{Main|Aspirin poisoning}}
Aspirin overdose can be acute or chronic. In acute poisoning, a single large dose is taken; in chronic poisoning, higher than normal doses are taken over a period of time. Acute overdose has a [[mortality rate]] of 2%. Chronic overdose is more commonly lethal, with a mortality rate of 25%;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kreplick, LW.|year=2001|title=Salicylate Toxicity in Emergency Medicine|publisher= [[Medscape]]|url=http://misc.medscape.com/pi/android/medscapeapp/html/A818242-business.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; chronic overdose may be especially severe in children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pediatrics1982-gaudreault&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Gaudreault P, Temple AR, Lovejoy FH Jr |title=The relative severity of acute versus chronic salicylate poisoning in children: a clinical comparison |journal=Pediatrics |year=1982 |pages=566–9 |volume=70 |issue=4 |pmid= 7122154}} (primary source)&lt;/ref&gt; Toxicity is managed with a number of potential treatments, including [[activated charcoal]], intravenous dextrose and normal saline, [[sodium bicarbonate]], and [[dialysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Rosen's emergency medicine: concepts and clinical practice |last=Marx |first=John |year=2006 |publisher=Mosby/Elsevier |isbn=978-0-323-02845-5 |page=2242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnosis of poisoning usually involves measurement of plasma salicylate, the active metabolite of aspirin, by automated spectrophotometric methods. Plasma salicylate levels in general range from 30–100&amp;nbsp;mg/l after usual therapeutic doses, 50–300&amp;nbsp;mg/l in patients taking high doses and 700–1400&amp;nbsp;mg/l following acute overdose.

==Chemical properties==
Aspirin decomposes rapidly in solutions of [[ammonium acetate]] or of the [[acetate]]s, [[carbonate]]s, [[citrate]]s, or [[hydroxide]]s of the [[alkali metals]]. It is stable in dry air, but gradually [[hydrolyses]] in contact with moisture to acetic and salicylic acids. In solution with alkalis, the hydrolysis proceeds rapidly and the clear solutions formed may consist entirely of acetate and salicylate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor=EF Reynolds|encyclopedia=Martindale: The Extra Pharmacopoeia|edition=28th|year=1982|pages=234–82|title=Aspirin and similar analgesic and anti-inflammatory agents}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthesis===
The synthesis of aspirin is classified as an [[ester]]ification reaction. [[Salicylic acid]] is treated with [[acetic anhydride]], an acid derivative, causing a chemical reaction that turns salicylic acid's [[hydroxyl]] group into an [[ester]] group (R-OH → R-OCOCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). This process yields aspirin and [[acetic acid]], which is considered a [[byproduct]] of this reaction. Small amounts of [[sulfuric acid]] (and occasionally [[phosphoric acid]]) are almost always used as a [[catalyst]]. This method is commonly employed in undergraduate teaching labs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Experimental Organic Chemistry |last=Palleros |first=Daniel R. |year=2000 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=New York|isbn=0-471-28250-2 |page=494}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polymorphism===
[[Polymorphism (materials science)|Polymorphism]], or the ability of a substance to form more than one [[crystal structure]], is important in the development of pharmaceutical ingredients. Many drugs are receiving regulatory approval for only a single crystal form or polymorph. For a long time, only one crystal structure for aspirin was known. That aspirin might have a second crystalline form was suspected since the 1960s. The elusive second polymorph was first discovered by Vishweshwar and coworkers in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vishweshwar | first1 = P. | last2 = McMahon | first2 = J.

The form II is only stable at 100{{Spaces}}[[Kelvin|K]] and reverts to form I at ambient temperature. In the (unambiguous) form I, two salicylic molecules form centrosymmetric [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimers]] through the acetyl groups with the (acidic) [[methyl]] proton to [[carbonyl]] [[hydrogen bond]]s, and in the newly claimed form II, each salicylic molecule forms the same hydrogen bonds with two neighboring molecules instead of one. With respect to the hydrogen bonds formed by the [[carboxylic acid]] groups, both polymorphs form identical dimer structures.

===Discovery of the mechanism===
In 1971, British [[pharmacologist]] [[John Robert Vane]], then employed by the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]] in London, showed aspirin suppressed the production of [[prostaglandin]]s and [[thromboxane]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis as a mechanism of action for aspirin-like drugs|author = Vane, John Robert | journal = Nature – New Biology| year = 1971| volume = 231| issue = 25| pages = 232–5| pmid= 5284360|doi = 10.1038/newbio231232a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Vane JR, Botting RM |year=2003 |title=The mechanism of action of aspirin |journal=Thromb Res |volume=110 |issue=5–6 |pages=255–8 |pmid=14592543 |doi=10.1016/S0049-3848(03)00379-7 |url=http://www.eao.chups.jussieu.fr/polys/certifopt/saule_coxib/theme/1vane2003.pdf |format=PDF|last2=Botting }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this discovery he was awarded the 1982 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]], jointly with [[Sune K. Bergström]] and [[Bengt I. Samuelsson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1982/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1982 |publisher=Nobelprize.or}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, he was made a [[Knight Bachelor]].

===Suppression of prostaglandins and thromboxanes===
Aspirin's ability to suppress the production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes is due to its irreversible inactivation of the [[cyclooxygenase]] (COX; officially known as prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase, PTGS) enzyme required for prostaglandin and thromboxane synthesis. Aspirin acts as an acetylating agent where an acetyl group is covalently attached to a [[serine]] residue in the active site of the PTGS enzyme. This makes aspirin different from other NSAIDs (such as [[diclofenac]] and [[ibuprofen]]), which are reversible inhibitors.

Low-dose aspirin use irreversibly blocks the formation of [[thromboxane A2|thromboxane A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in platelets, producing an inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation during the lifetime of the affected platelet (8–9 days). This antithrombotic property makes aspirin useful for reducing the incidence of heart attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4456 |title=Aspirin in Heart Attack and Stroke Prevention |accessdate=8 May 2008 |publisher=American Heart Association |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080331031146/http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4456 |archivedate=31 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 40&amp;nbsp;mg of aspirin a day is able to inhibit a large proportion of maximum thromboxane A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release provoked acutely, with the prostaglandin I2 synthesis being little affected; however, higher doses of aspirin are required to attain further inhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Tohgi |first1=H |author2=S Konno, K Tamura, B Kimura and K Kawano|year = 1992|title = Effects of low-to-high doses of aspirin on platelet aggregability and metabolites of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin|journal = Stroke| volume = 23|pages = 1400–1403 |pmid=1412574|issue = 10| doi=10.1161/01.STR.23.10.1400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prostaglandins, local [[hormone]]s produced in the body, have diverse effects, including the transmission of pain information to the brain, modulation of the [[hypothalamus|hypothalamic]] thermostat, and inflammation. Thromboxanes are responsible for the aggregation of platelets that form [[clot|blood clots]]. Heart attacks are caused primarily by blood clots, and low doses of aspirin are seen as an effective medical intervention for acute myocardial infarction.

===COX-1 and COX-2 inhibition===
At least two different types of cyclooxygenase occur: COX-1 and COX-2. Aspirin irreversibly inhibits COX-1 and modifies the enzymatic activity of COX-2. COX-2 normally produces prostanoids, most of which are proinflammatory. Aspirin-modified PTGS2 produces lipoxins, most of which are anti-inflammatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|
volume=2|issue=3|title=Pharmacokinetic Solubility And Dissolution Profile of Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs|author=Achhrish goel, Ruchi gupta Anubhav goswami Madhu soodan sharma Yogesh sharma|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newer NSAID drugs, [[COX-2 inhibitor]]s (coxibs), have been developed to inhibit only PTGS2, with the intent to reduce the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;cox3article&quot; /&gt;

However, several of the new COX-2 inhibitors, such as [[rofecoxib]] (Vioxx), have been withdrawn recently, after evidence emerged that PTGS2 inhibitors increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Curr Pharm Des |year=2007 |volume=13 |issue=22 |pages=2215–27 |title=Mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular effects of COX-inhibition: benefits and risks |author=Martínez-González J, Badimon L |pmid=17691994 |doi=10.2174/138161207781368774|last2=Badimon }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Cardiovasc Pharmacol |title=COX-2 inhibitors and cardiovascular risk |author=Funk CD, FitzGerald GA |date=November 2007 |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=470–9 |pmid=18030055 |doi=10.1097/FJC.0b013e318157f72d|last2=Fitzgerald }}&lt;/ref&gt; Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express PTGS2, and, by selectively inhibiting PTGS2, prostaglandin production (specifically, PGI2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as PTGS1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of [[PGI2]] is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible inhibitors.

===Additional mechanisms===
Aspirin has been shown to have at least three additional modes of action. It uncouples [[oxidative phosphorylation]] in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons.&lt;ref name=&quot;SomasundaramS&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Somasundaram|first2=G|first3=RJ|first4=J|first5=M|first6=IA|first7=S|first8=A|first9=R|issue=5|last2=Sigthorsson|last3=Simpson|last4=Watts|last5=Jacob|last6=Tavares|last7=Rafi|last8=Roseth|last9=Foster |year=2000|title=Uncoupling of intestinal mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and inhibition of cyclooxygenase are required for the development of NSAID-enteropathy in the rat|journal=Aliment Pharmacol Ther|volume=14|pages=639–650|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2036.2000.00723.x|pmid=10792129|last10=Price|last11=Wrigglesworth|last12=Bjarnason|first10=AB|first12=I| displayauthors=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, aspirin buffers and transports the protons. When high doses of aspirin are given, it may actually cause fever, owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain, as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses. In addition, aspirin induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation. This reduced leukocyte adhesion, which is an important step in immune response to infection; however, evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Mark J. |last=Paul-Clark |first2=Thong van |last2=Cao |first3=Niloufar |last3=Moradi-Bidhendi |first4=Dianne |last4=Cooper |first5=Derek W. |last5=Gilroy |lastauthoramp=yes |title=15-epi-lipoxin A4–mediated Induction of Nitric Oxide Explains How Aspirin Inhibits Acute Inflammation |journal=J.

Aspirin is readily broken down in the body to salicylic acid, which itself has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic effects. In 2012, salicylic acid was found to activate [[AMP-activated protein kinase]], which has been suggested as a possible explanation for some of the effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawley | first1 = S.

===Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity===

==Pharmacokinetics==
Salicylic acid is a weak acid, and very little of it is [[Acid dissociation constant|ionized]] in the [[stomach]] after oral administration. Acetylsalicylic acid is poorly soluble in the [[pH|acidic]] conditions of the stomach, which can delay absorption of high doses for eight to 24 hours. The increased pH and larger surface area of the [[small intestine]] causes aspirin to be absorbed rapidly there, which in turn allows more of the salicylate to dissolve. Owing to the issue of solubility, however, aspirin is absorbed much more slowly during overdose, and [[blood plasma|plasma]] concentrations can continue to rise for up to 24 hours after ingestion.&lt;ref name=&quot;'RK Ferguson'&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Death following self-poisoning with aspirin|journal=Journal of the American Medical Association|date=17 August 1970|first1=RK|last1=Ferguson|author2=Boutros, AR|volume=213|issue=7|pages=1186–8|pmid=5468267|doi=10.1001/jama.213.7.1186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;'FL Kaufman'&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Darvon poisoning with delayed salicylism: a case report|journal=Pediatrics|date=April 1970|first1=FL|last1=Kaufman|author2=Dubansky, AS|volume=49|issue=4|pages=610–1|pmid=5013423}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;G Levy&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJM197208312870903|title=Salicylate accumulation kinetics in man |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |date=31 August 1972 |first1=G |last1=Levy |author2=Tsuchiya, T |volume=287 |issue=9 |pages=430–2 |pmid=5044917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 50–80% of salicylate in the blood is bound to albumin [[protein]], while the rest remains in the active, ionized state; protein binding is concentration-dependent. Saturation of binding sites leads to more free salicylate and increased toxicity. The volume of distribution is 0.1–0.2 l/kg. Acidosis increases the volume of distribution because of enhancement of tissue penetration of salicylates.&lt;ref name=&quot;G Levy&quot;/&gt;

As much as 80% of therapeutic doses of salicylic acid is [[metabolism|metabolized]] in the [[liver]]. Conjugation with [[glycine]] forms [[salicyluric acid]], and with [[glucuronic acid]] it forms salicyl acyl and phenolic glucuronide. These metabolic pathways have only a limited capacity. Small amounts of salicylic acid are also hydroxylated to [[gentisic acid]]. With large salicylate doses, the kinetics switch from first-order to zero-order, as [[metabolic pathway]]s become saturated and [[kidney|renal]] excretion becomes increasingly important.&lt;ref name=&quot;G Levy&quot;/&gt;

Salicylates are excreted mainly by the kidneys as salicyluric acid (75%), free salicylic acid (10%), salicylic phenol (10%), and acyl glucuronides (5%), [[gentisic acid]] (&lt; 1%), and [[2,3-Dihydroxybenzoic acid|2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;2,3-Dihydroxybenzoic acid is a product of human aspirin metabolism.

[[File:Aspirine-1923.jpg|thumb|left|1923 advertisement]]
Plant extracts, including [[willow]] [[bark]] and [[spiraea]], of which salicylic acid was the active ingredient, had been known to help alleviate headaches, pains, and fevers since antiquity. The father of modern medicine, [[Hippocrates]] (''circa'' 460 – 377 BC), left historical records describing the use of powder made from the bark and leaves of the willow tree to help these symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mary Bellis |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blaspirin.htm |title=History of aspirin |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date=16 June 2010 |accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1763, Edward Stone, at Oxford, isolated the active ingredient of aspirin in his discovery of salicylic acid. A French chemist, [[Charles Frederic Gerhardt]], was the first to prepare acetylsalicylic acid in 1853. In the course of his work on the synthesis and properties of various [[acid anhydride]]s, he mixed [[acetyl chloride]] with a [[sodium]] salt of salicylic acid ([[sodium salicylate]]). A vigorous reaction ensued, and the resulting melt soon solidified.&lt;ref name=gerhardt&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Gerhardt, Ch.|title=Untersuchungen über die wasserfreien organischen Säuren |trans_title=Investigations into anhydrous organic acids|journal=Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie|volume=87|pages=149–179|year=1853 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Wus2AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA149#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|doi=10.1002/jlac.18530870107|language=de}}  See especially pages 162-163.&lt;/ref&gt; Since no [[structural theory]] existed at that time, Gerhardt called the compound he obtained &quot;salicylic-acetic anhydride&quot; (''wasserfreie Salicylsäure-Essigsäure''). This preparation of aspirin (&quot;salicylic-acetic anhydride&quot;) was one of the many reactions Gerhardt conducted for his paper on anhydrides and he did not pursue it further.

Six years later, in 1859, von Gilm obtained analytically pure acetylsalicylic acid (which he called ''acetylierte Salicylsäure'', acetylated salicylic acid) by a reaction of salicylic acid and acetyl chloride.&lt;ref name=gilm&gt;{{Cite journal|author=von Gilm H|title=Acetylderivate der Phloretin- und Salicylsäure|trans_title=Acetyl derivatives of phloretic and salicylic acids|journal=Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie|volume=112|issue=2|pages=180–182|year=1859|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NYs8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA180#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|doi=10.1002/jlac.18591120207|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1869, Schröder, Prinzhorn, and Kraut repeated both Gerhardt's (from sodium salicylate) and von Gilm's (from salicylic acid) syntheses and concluded both reactions gave the same compound—acetylsalicylic acid. They were first to assign to it the correct structure with the acetyl group connected to the phenolic oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author= Schröder, Prinzhorn, Kraut K|title=Ueber Salicylverbindungen|trans_title=On compounds of salicylic acid|journal=Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie|volume=150 |issue=1 |pages=1–20 |year=1869|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x002457978;view=1up;seq=399|doi=10.1002/jlac.18691500102|last2=Prinzhorn|last3=Kraut|language=de}}See especially pages 9-13; the structural formula of acetylsalicylic acid appears on p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, chemists working at Bayer AG produced a synthetically altered version of [[salicin]], derived from the species ''[[Filipendula ulmaria]]'' (meadowsweet), which caused less digestive upset than pure salicylic acid. The identity of the lead chemist on this project is a matter of controversy. Bayer states the work was done by [[Felix Hoffmann]], but the Jewish chemist [[Arthur Eichengrün]] later claimed he was the lead investigator and records of his contribution were expunged under the [[Nazi]] regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mahdi|first1=JG|author2=Mahdi, AJ, Mahdi, AJ, Bowen, ID|title=The historical analysis of aspirin discovery, its relation to the willow tree and antiproliferative and anticancer potential|journal=Cell proliferation|date=April 2006|volume=39|issue=2|pages=147–55|pmid=16542349|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2184.2006.00377.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new drug, formally acetylsalicylic acid, was named Aspirin by Bayer AG after the [[botany|botanical]] name for meadowsweet, ''Spiraea ulmaria'', derived from &quot;acetyl&quot; and ''Spirsäure'', an old German name for salicylic acid derived from the Latin ''Spiraea ulmaria''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Singer |first=H. |title=Ueber Aspirin |journal=Pflügers Archiv: European Journal of Physiology |volume=84 |issue=11–12 |year=1901 |pages=527–546 |doi=10.1007/BF01769129}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1899, Bayer was selling it around the world.&lt;ref name=Jeffreys_73&gt;{{Harvnb|Jeffreys|2005|pp=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of aspirin grew over the first half of the 20th century, spurred by its supposed effectiveness in the wake of the [[Spanish flu pandemic]] of 1918.

==Veterinary use==
Aspirin is sometimes used for pain relief or as an anticoagulant in veterinary medicine, primarily in dogs and sometimes horses, although newer medications with fewer side effects are generally used, instead.

Both dogs and horses are susceptible to the gastrointestinal side effects associated with salicylates, but it is a convenient treatment for arthritis in older dogs, and has shown some promise in cases of [[laminitis]] in horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Crosby|first = Janet Tobiassen|title = Veterinary Questions and Answers|publisher = About.com|year = 2006|url = http://vetmedicine.about.com/cs/altvetmedgeneral/a/dogcataspirin.htm|accessdate =5 September 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070908151020/http://vetmedicine.about.com/cs/altvetmedgeneral/a/dogcataspirin.htm| archivedate= 8 September 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CambridgeH&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Cambridge H, Lees P, Hooke RE, Russell CS|title=Antithrombotic actions of aspirin in the horse |journal=Equine Vet J |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=123–7 |year=1991 |pmid=1904347|doi=10.1111/j.2042-3306.1991.tb02736.x|last2=Lees |last3=Hooke |last4=Russell }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is no longer commonly used for cases of laminitis, as it could be counterproductive for treatment.

Aspirin should be used in animals only under the direct supervision of a [[veterinarian]]; in particular, cats lack the [[glucuronide]] conjugates that aid in the excretion of aspirin, making even low doses potentially toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Lappin, Michael R.|title=Feline internal medicine secrets|year=2001|publisher=Hanley &amp; Belfus|location=Philadelphia|isbn=1-56053-461-3|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;
