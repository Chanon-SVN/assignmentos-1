In 2001, the population of the town was 13,444. It is the largest town in the [[Vale of Leven]], the others being [[Balloch, Dunbartonshire|Balloch]], [[Bonhill]], [[Jamestown, Dunbartonshire|Jamestown]] and [[Renton, Scotland|Renton]]; their combined population is over 20,000.

The town's traditional industries, most importantly cotton manufacturing, bleaching and printing, have been phased out. The town was redeveloped in the 1970s with a new town centre layout and traffic system. Local landmarks include Christie Park, and the Fountain in the town centre. Lomond Galleries on North Main Street is a former car factory with an impressive dome and an even more impressive marble entrance hall and staircase. It was originally built in 1906 as the [[Argyll Motor Works]], for [[Argyll (car)|Argyll Motors Ltd]]. A carving above the entrance shows one of the company's cars. After the car production ceased in 1914 it was used by the [[Admiralty]] for the manufacture of [[torpedo]]es, which were test-fired in [[Loch Long]], and in the early 1970s was the scene of the [[Plessey]] sit-in.&lt;ref name=wdc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/tourism-and-visitor-attractions/museums-and-galleries/collections/industry/argyll-motor-works/ |title=Argyll Works |publisher=West Dunbartonshire Council |accessdate=28 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town is reputed to be the only UK town with a railway station and a [[public house|pub]] in the middle of a roundabout. [[A. J. Cronin]]'s uncle owned a pub in Bridge Street. Alexandria Library is located on Gilmour Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexandria Library|url=http://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/education-and-learning/libraries/library-branches/alexandria-library/|work=West Dunbartonshire Council|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
