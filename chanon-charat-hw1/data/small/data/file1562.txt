'''AutoCAD''' is a [[commercial software|commercial]] [[software application]] for [[2D computer graphics|2D]] and [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[computer-aided design|computer-aided design (CAD)]] and [[technical drawing|drafting]] &amp;mdash; available since 1982 as a desktop application and since 2010 as a mobile web- and cloud-based [[Application software|app]] marketed as AutoCAD 360.

Developed and marketed by [[Autodesk, Inc.]],&lt;ref name = Lendio&gt;{{cite web|title= Autodesk, Inc |url= http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Autodesk-Inc-company-History.html| publisher= Lendio | accessdate = 29 March 2012| work =FundingUniverse| year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; AutoCAD was first released in December 1982, running on [[microcomputers]] with internal [[graphics controller]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://cadhistory.net/08%20Autodesk%20and%20AutoCAD.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the introduction of AutoCAD, most commercial CAD programs ran on [[mainframe computer]]s or [[minicomputer]]s, with each CAD operator (user) working at a separate [[graphics terminal]].&lt;ref&gt;http://cadhistory.net/02%20Brief%20Overview.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

AutoCAD is used across a wide range of industries, by architects, project managers, engineers, designers, and other professionals. It is supported by 750 training centers worldwide as of 1994.&lt;ref name=Lendio /&gt;

As Autodesk's flagship product, by March 1986 AutoCAD had become the most ubiquitous CAD program worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=25 Year retrospective | chapter = Part 2 CAD/CAM/CAE|url=http://www.cgw.com/Publications/CGW/2002/Volume-25-Issue-2-Feb-2002-/25-YEAR-RETROSPECTIVE-br-Part-2-CAD-CAM-CAE.aspx |publisher=Computer Graphics World|accessdate=29 March 2012|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014, AutoCAD is in its twenty-ninth generation, and collectively with all its variants, continues to be the most widely used CAD program throughout most of the world.

== History ==
AutoCAD was derived from a program begun in 1977 and released in 1979&lt;ref name=RiddleAbout&gt;{{cite web|last=Riddle|first=Michael|title=About|url=http://www.michaelriddle.com/?page_id=2|accessdate=24 January 2014|quote=&quot;Iâ€™ve been building CAD products for over 29 years now, starting with Interact for the Marinchip 9900 released back in 1979, one of the first PC-based CAD programs available. Interact went on to become the architectural basis for the early versions of AutoCAD. I was one of the original 18 founders of that company.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  called [[Interact CAD]], also referred to in early Autodesk documents as MicroCAD, which was written prior to Autodesk's (then Marinchip Software Partners) formation by Autodesk cofounder Mike Riddle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Walker|first=John|title=Information letter #5|url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/autofile/www/section2_9_7.html|accessdate=24 January 2014|date=1 May 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=3DCADWorld&gt;{{cite web|last=Yare|first=Evan|title=AutoCAD's Ancestor|url=http://www.3dcadworld.com/autocads-ancestor/|publisher=3D CAD World|accessdate=24 January 2014|date=17 Feb 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first version by the AutoDesk company was demonstrated at the 1982 [[Comdex]] and released that December.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=One Company's CAD Success Story|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qS4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39|publisher=InfoWorld|accessdate=19 July 2014|date=3 December 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 release marked the 29th major release for the AutoCAD for Windows.  The 2014 release marked the fourth consecutive year for AutoCAD for [[Mac OS|Mac]].

=== File formats and versions===
The native file format of AutoCAD is ''[[.dwg]]''.  This and, to a lesser extent, its interchange file format ''[[DXF]]'', have become [[de facto]], if proprietary, standards for CAD data [[interoperability]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} AutoCAD has included support for .dwg, a format developed and promoted by Autodesk, for publishing CAD data.

==== Compatibility with other software ====

ESRI ArcMap 10 permits export as AutoCAD drawing files. Civil 3D permits export as AutoCAD objects and as [[LandXML]]. Third-party [[file converter]]s exist for specific formats such as Bentley MX GENIO Extension, PISTE Extension (France), 
ISYBAU (Germany), OKSTRA and [[Microdrainage]] (UK).&lt;ref name=&quot;autodesk civil3d ug 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/civil_users_guide0.pdf | title=AutoCAD Civil 3D 2011 Drawing Compatibility | publisher=[[Autodesk]] | work=AutoCAD Civil 3D 2011 User's Guide | date=April 2010 | accessdate=January 29, 2013 | pages=141{{ndash}}142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Languages ===
AutoCAD 2014 and AutoCAD LT 2014 are available for [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Chinese Simplified]], [[Chinese Traditional]] and [[Brazilian Portuguese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AutoCAD Language Packs|url=http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?siteID=123112&amp;id=21282814&amp;linkID=9240618|publisher=Autodesk|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AutoCAD Language Packs|url=http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/item?siteID=123112&amp;id=21283153&amp;linkID=9240818|publisher=Autodesk|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] will be available later on. The extent of localization varies from full translation of the product to documentation only. The AutoCAD command set is localized as a part of the software localization.

=== Extensions ===
AutoCAD supports a number of [[application program interface|API]]s for customization and automation. These include [[AutoLISP]], [[Visual LISP]], [[Visual Basic for Applications|VBA]], [[Microsoft .NET|.NET]] and [[ObjectARX]]. ObjectARX is a [[C++]] class library, which was also the base for: (a) products extending AutoCAD functionality to specific fields; (b) creating products such as AutoCAD Architecture, AutoCAD Electrical, AutoCAD Civil 3D; or (c) third-party AutoCAD-based application.
There are a large number of AutoCAD plugins (add-on applications) available on the application store Autodesk Exchange Apps
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AutoCAD Exchange Apps|url=http://apps.exchange.autodesk.com/|publisher=Autodesk|accessdate=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vertical integration ===
Autodesk has also developed a few vertical programs (AutoCAD Architecture, AutoCAD Civil 3D, AutoCAD Electrical, AutoCAD ecscad, AutoCAD Map 3D, AutoCAD Mechanical, AutoCAD MEP, AutoCAD Structural Detailing, AutoCAD Utility Design, AutoCAD P&amp;ID and AutoCAD Plant 3D) for discipline-specific enhancements. For example, [[AutoCAD Architecture]] (formerly Architectural Desktop) permits architectural designers to draw 3D objects, such as walls, doors and windows, with more intelligent data associated with them rather than simple objects, such as lines and circles. The data can be programmed to represent specific architectural products sold in the construction industry, or extracted into a data file for pricing, materials estimation, and other values related to the objects represented. Additional tools generate standard 2D drawings, such as elevations and sections, from a 3D architectural model. Similarly, Civil Design, Civil Design 3D, and Civil Design Professional support data-specific objects, facilitating easy standard civil engineering calculations and representations. Civil 3D was originally developed as an AutoCAD add-on by a company in New Hampshire called Softdesk (originally DCA).  Softdesk was acquired by Autodesk, and Civil 3D was further evolved.

== Variants ==

=== AutoCAD LT ===
AutoCAD LT is the lower cost version of AutoCAD, with reduced capabilities, first released in November 1993. Autodesk developed AutoCAD LT to have an entry-level CAD package to compete in the lower price level. AutoCAD LT, priced at $495, became the first AutoCAD product priced below $1000. It is sold directly by Autodesk and can also be purchased at computer stores (unlike the full version of AutoCAD, which must be purchased from official Autodesk dealers).

As of the 2011 release the AutoCAD LT MSRP has risen to $1200. While there are hundreds of small differences between the full AutoCAD package and AutoCAD LT, there are a few recognized major differences&lt;ref&gt;http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/autocad_lt_2011_faq.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in the software's features:

* 3D Capabilities: AutoCAD LT lacks the ability to create, visualize and render 3D models as well as 3D printing.
* Network Licensing: AutoCAD LT cannot be used on multiple machines over a network.
* Customization: AutoCAD LT does not support customization with LISP, ARX, and VBA.
* Management and automation capabilities with Sheet Set Manager and Action Recorder.
* CAD standards management tools.

AutoCAD LT 2015 introduced Desktop Subscription from $360 per year.

=== AutoCAD 360 ===

}}
Formerly marketed as AutoCAD WS, AutoCAD 360 is an account-based mobile and web application enabling registered users to view, edit, and share AutoCAD files via mobile device and web&lt;ref name=iTunes&gt;{{cite web|last=Autodesk|title=AutoCAD WS|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/autocad-ws/id393149734?mt=8|work=iTunes Preview|publisher=Apple|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; using a limited AutoCAD feature set &amp;mdash; and using cloud-stored drawing files.  The program, which is an evolution and combination of previous products, uses a [[freemium]] business model with a free plan and two paid levels &amp;mdash; marketed as Pro ($4.99 monthly or $49.99 yearly) and Pro Plus ($99.99 yearly) &amp;mdash; including various amounts of storage, tools, and online access to drawings. 360 includes new features such as a &quot;Smart Pen&quot; mode and linking to third-party cloud-based storage such as [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]]. Having evolved from Flash-based software, AutoCAD 360 uses [[HTML5]] browser technology available in newer browsers including Firefox and Google Chrome.

AutoCAD WS began with a Flash-based version for the [[iPhone]] and subsequently expanded to include version for the [[iPod Touch]], [[iPad]], Android phones, and Android tablets.&lt;ref name=OzlerMaciPadiPhone&gt;{{cite web|last=Ozler|first=Levent|title=AutoCAD for Mac and AutoCAD WS application for iPad and iPhone|url=http://www.dexigner.com/news/21266|work=Dexigner|publisher=[[Dexigner]]|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Autodesk released the [[iOS]] version in September 2010,&lt;ref name=OzlerBuiltForMac&gt;{{cite web|last=Ozler|first=Levent|title=AutoCAD for Mac 2012: Built for Mac OS X Lion|url=http://www.dexigner.com/news/23640|work=Dexigner|publisher=[[Dexigner]]|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; following with the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] version on April 20, 2011.&lt;ref name=OzlerWSAndroid&gt;{{cite web|last=Ozler|first=Levent|title=AutoCAD WS for Android|url=http://www.dexigner.com/news/22874|work=Dexigner|publisher=[[Dexigner]]|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is available via download at no cost from the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] ([[iOS]]), [[Google Play]] ([[Android (operating system)|Android]]) and [[Amazon Appstore]] (Android).

In its initial iOS version, AutoCAD WS supported drawing of lines, circles, and other shapes; creation of text and comment boxes; and management of color, layer, and measurements &amp;mdash; in both landscape and portrait modes. Version 1.3, released August 17, 2011, added support of unit typing, layer visibility, area measurement and file management.&lt;ref name=iTunes/&gt; The Android variant includes the iOS feature set along with such unique features as the ability to insert text or captions by voice command as well as manually.&lt;ref name=OzlerWSAndroid/&gt; Both Android and iOS versions allow the user to save files on-line &amp;mdash; or off-line in the absence of an Internet connection.&lt;ref name=OzlerWSAndroid/&gt;

In 2011, Autodesk announced plans to migrate the majority of its software to &quot;[[cloud computing|the cloud]]&quot;, starting with the AutoCAD WS mobile application.&lt;ref name=Cloud&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomson|first=Iain|title=Autodesk Shifts Design Apps to the Cloud|url=http://jump.dexigner.com/news/23929|work=The A Register|publisher=The A Register|accessdate=30 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2013 interview with Ilai Rotbaein, an AutoCAD WS Product Manager for Autodesk, the name '''''AutoCAD WS''''' had no definitive meaning, and was interpreted variously as ''Autodesk Web Service'', ''White Sheet'' or ''Work Space.''&lt;ref name=forward&gt;{{cite web

=== Student versions ===
AutoCAD is licensed at a significant discount over commercial retail pricing to qualifying students and teachers, with a 36-month license available. The student version of AutoCAD is functionally identical to the full commercial version, with one exception: DWG files created or edited by a student version have an internal bit-flag set (the &quot;educational flag&quot;). When such a DWG file is printed by any version of AutoCAD (commercial or student) older than AutoCAD 2014 SP1, the output includes a plot stamp / banner on all four sides. Objects created in the Student Version cannot be used for commercial use. Student Version objects &quot;infect&quot; a commercial version DWG file if it is imported in older versions than AutoCAD 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.autodesk.com/ACD/2011/ENU/filesAUG/WS1a9193826455f5ffa23ce210c4a30acaf-6050.htm Overview of Plotting&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Autodesk Education Community provides registered students and faculty with free access to different Autodesk applications.

== Ports ==

=== Android ===
Autodesk AutoCAD 360 is the official AutoCAD mobile app for [[Android (operating system)|Android]].&lt;ref&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.autodesk.autocadws&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Microsoft Windows ===
AutoCAD is a software created for Windows and usually any new AutoCAD version supports the current Windows version and some older ones. AutoCAD 2015 supports Windows 7 up to Windows 8.1.

=== Mac OS ===
[[File:AutoCAD 2012 for Mac Basic Layout Picture.png|thumb|330px|right|AutoCAD 2012 for Mac]]

Autodesk stopped supporting Apple's computers in 1994. Over the next several years, no compatible versions for Macintosh computers were released. In 2010 Autodesk announced that it would once again support Apple's Mac OS X software in the future.&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt; Most of the features found in the 2012 Windows version can be found in the 2012 Mac version. The main difference is the user interface and layout of the program. The interface is designed so that users who are already familiar with Apple's [[OS X]] software will find it similar to other Mac applications.&lt;ref name=OzlerBuiltForMac/&gt; Autodesk has also built in various features in order to take full advantage of Apple's Trackpad capabilities as well as the full-screen mode in Apple's [[OS X Lion]].&lt;ref name=OzlerMaciPadiPhone/&gt;&lt;ref name=OzlerBuiltForMac /&gt; AutoCAD 2012 for Mac supports both the editing and saving of files in DWG formatting that will allow the file to be compatible with other platforms besides the OS X.&lt;ref name=OzlerMaciPadiPhone /&gt; AutoCAD 2014 for Mac supports Apple Mac OS X v10.9.0 or later (Mavericks), OS X v10.8.0 or later (Mountain Lion) with 64-bit Intel processor.

AutoCAD LT 2013 is now available through the [[Mac App Store]] for $899.99. The full featured version of AutoCAD 2013 for Mac, however, is not available through the Mac App Store due to the price limit of $999 set by Apple. AutoCAD 2014 for Mac is available for purchase from Autodesk's Web site for $4,195 and AutoCAD LT 2014 for Mac for $1,200, or from an Autodesk Authorized Reseller.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite news|last=Clark|first=Don|title=Autodesk Adopts Apple App Store for Mac Software|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/08/16/autodesk-adopts-apple-app-store-for-mac-software/?KEYWORDS=AutoCAD|accessdate=30 September 2011|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
