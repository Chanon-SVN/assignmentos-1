The '''British Museum''' is a [[museum]] dedicated to human history and culture, located in the [[Bloomsbury]] area of [[London]].
Its permanent collection, numbering some 8 million works,&lt;ref name=&quot;britishmuseum.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/management/about_us.aspx |title=About us|work=British Museum|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is among the largest and most comprehensive in existence&lt;ref name=&quot;britishmuseum.org&quot;/&gt; and originates from all continents, illustrating and documenting the story of human culture from its beginnings to the present.{{Ref label|A|a|none}}

The British Museum was established in 1753, largely based on the collections of the physician and scientist [[Hans Sloane|Sir Hans Sloane]]. The museum first opened to the public on 15 January 1759 in [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]] in [[Bloomsbury]], on the site of the current museum building. Its expansion over the following two and a half centuries was largely a result of an expanding British colonial footprint and has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions, the first being the [[Natural History Museum, London|British Museum (Natural History)]] in [[South Kensington]] in 1881. Some objects in the collection, most notably the [[Elgin Marbles]] from the [[Parthenon]], are the objects of controversy and of calls for restitution to their countries of origin.

Until 1997, when the [[British Library]] (previously centred on the [[British Museum Reading Room|Round Reading Room]]) moved to a new site, the British Museum housed both a national museum of antiquities and a [[national library]] in the same building. The museum is a [[non-departmental public body]] sponsored by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]], and as with all other national museums in the United Kingdom it charges no admission fee, except for loan exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/visiting/admission_and_opening_times.aspx|title=Admission and opening times|work=British Museum|date=14 June 2010|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002 the [[Director of the British Museum|director of the museum]] has been [[Neil MacGregor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1682270.stm|work=BBC News |title=National man for British Museum|date=29 November 2001|accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Sir Hans Sloane, founder of the British Museum===
[[File:Sir Hans Sloane, an engraving from a portrait by T. Murray.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir [[Hans Sloane]]]]

Although today principally a museum of cultural art objects and [[Ancient history|antiquities]], the British Museum was founded as a &quot;universal museum&quot;. Its foundations lie in the will of the physician and naturalist [[Hans Sloane|Sir Hans Sloane]] (1660–1753). During the course of his lifetime Sloane gathered an enviable [[cabinet of curiosities|collection of curiosities]] and, not wishing to see his collection broken up after death, he bequeathed it to [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]], for the nation, for the princely sum of £20,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fathom.com/course/21701728/session1.html|title=Creating a Great Museum: Early Collectors and The British Museum|publisher=Fathom|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, Sloane's collection consisted of around 71,000 objects of all kinds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/history/general_history.aspx|title=General history|work=British Museum|date=14 June 2010|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; including some 40,000 printed books, 7,000 [[manuscript]]s, extensive natural history specimens including 337 volumes of dried plants, [[Old master print|prints]] and drawings including those by [[Albrecht Dürer]] and antiquities from  [[Kingdom of Kush|Sudan]],  [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], the [[Ancient Near East|Ancient Near]] and [[East Asia|Far East]] and the [[History of the Americas|Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;Gavin R de Beer, Sir Hans Sloane and the British Museum (London, 1953).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation (1753)===
On 7 June 1753, King George II gave his formal assent to the [[Act of Parliament]] which established the British Museum.{{Ref label|B|b|none}} The [[British Museum Act 1753]] also added two other libraries to the Sloane collection, namely the [[Cotton library|Cottonian Library]], assembled by [[Robert Bruce Cotton|Sir Robert Cotton]], dated back to [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] times and the [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Harleian library]], the collection of the [[Earl of Oxford|Earls of Oxford]]. They were joined in 1757 by the Royal Library, assembled by various [[British monarchy|British monarchs]]. Together these four &quot;foundation collections&quot; included many of the most treasured books now in the British Library&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Charles Long (1823), BMCE115/3,10. Scrapbooks and illustrations of the Museum. (Wilson, David, M.) (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, pg 346&lt;/ref&gt; including the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] and the sole surviving copy of ''[[Beowulf]]''.{{Ref label|C|c|none}}

[[File:The North Prospect of Mountague House JamesSimonc1715.jpg|thumb|right|[[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]], c. 1715]]

The British Museum was the first of a new kind of museum – national, belonging to neither church nor king, freely open to the public and aiming to collect everything. Sloane's collection, while including a vast miscellany of objects, tended to reflect his scientific interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmimages.com/preview.asp?image=00032676001&amp;imagex=90&amp;searchnum=0001|title=The British Museum Images|publisher=Bmimages|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of the [[Robert Bruce Cotton|Cotton]] and [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer|Harley manuscripts]] introduced a literary and [[antiquarian]] element and meant that the British Museum now became both national museum and library.&lt;ref name=&quot;world and its people&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dunton|first=Larkin|title=The World and Its People|publisher=Silver, Burdett|year=1896|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cabinet of curiosities (1753–78)===
[[File:Rosetta Stone International Congress of Orientalists ILN 1874.jpg|thumb|The [[Rosetta Stone]] on display in the British Museum in 1874]]
The body of trustees decided on a converted 17th-century mansion, [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]], as a location for the museum, which it bought from the [[Ralph Montagu, 1st Duke of Montagu|Montagu family]] for £20,000. The Trustees rejected Buckingham House, on the site now occupied by [[Buckingham Palace]], on the grounds of cost and the unsuitability of its location.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, David, M. (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|D|d|none}}

With the acquisition of Montagu House the first exhibition galleries and [[Library|reading room]] for scholars opened on 15 January 1759.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historytoday.com/MainArticle.aspx?m=33121&amp;amid=30262261 The British Museum Opened], History Today&lt;/ref&gt; In 1757 King George II gave the [[Royal Library, Windsor|Old Royal Library]] and with it the right to a copy of every book published in the country, thereby ensuring that the Museum's library would expand indefinitely. During the few years after its foundation the British Museum received several further gifts, including the [[Thomason Collection of Civil War Tracts]] and [[David Garrick]]'s library of 1,000 printed plays. The predominance of natural history, books and manuscripts began to lessen when in 1772 the Museum acquired for £8,400 its first significant antiquities in [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]]'s &quot;first&quot; collection of [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Greek vases]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe/p/portrait_plaque_of_sir_william.aspx BM, &quot;Portrait plaque of Sir William Hamilton&quot;] British Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indolence and energy (1778–1800)===
From 1778 a display of objects from the [[Pacific Ocean|South Sea]]s brought back from the round-the-world voyages of Captain [[James Cook]] and the travels of other explorers fascinated visitors with a glimpse of previously unknown lands. The bequest of a collection of books, [[engraved gem]]s, coins, prints and drawings by [[Clayton Mordaunt Cracherode]] in 1800 did much to raise the Museum's reputation; but Montagu House became increasingly crowded and decrepit and it was apparent that it would be unable to cope with further expansion.&lt;ref&gt;BMCE1/5, 1175 (13 May 1820). Minutes of General Meeting of the Trustees, 1754–63. (Wilson, David, M. (2002). The British Museum: A History, p. 78)&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum’s first notable addition towards its collection of antiquities, since its foundation, was by Sir [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|William Hamilton]] (1730–1803), British Ambassador to [[Naples]], who sold his collection of Greek and Roman artefacts to the museum in 1784 together with a number of other antiquities and natural history specimens. A list of donations to the Museum, dated 31 January 1784 refers to the Hamilton bequest of a &quot;Colossal Foot of an [[Apollo]] in Marble&quot;. It was one of two antiquities of Hamilton's collection drawn for him by Francesco Progenie, a pupil of Pietro Fabris, who also contributed a number of drawings of Mount Vesuvius sent by Hamilton to the [[Royal Society]] in London.

===Growth and change (1800–25)===

[[File:P8282318.1.JPG|thumb|right|Left to Right: [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]], Townley Gallery and [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Sir Robert Smirke]]'s west wing under construction, July 1828]]
[[File:Mauso03.JPG|thumb|The [[Mausoleum at Halicarnassus|Mausoleum of Halicarnassus]] Room, 1920s]]

In the early 19th century the foundations for the extensive collection of sculpture began to be laid and Greek, Roman and Egyptian artefacts dominated the antiquities displays. After the defeat of the [[Campaigns of 1799 in the French Revolutionary Wars|French campaign]] in the [[Battle of the Nile]], in 1801, the British Museum acquired more Egyptian sculptures and in 1802 [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] presented the [[Rosetta Stone]] – key to the deciphering of hieroglyphs.&lt;ref&gt;''Wondrous Curiosities – Ancient Egypt at the British Museum'', pp. 66–72 (Stephanie Moser, 2006, ISBN 0-226-54209-2)&lt;/ref&gt; Gifts and purchases from [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]], British consul general in Egypt, beginning with the [[Younger Memnon|Colossal bust of Ramesses II]] in 1818, laid the foundations of the collection of Egyptian Monumental Sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;''The Story of the British Museum'', p. 24 (Marjorie Caygill, 2003, ISBN 0-7141-2772-8)&lt;/ref&gt; Many Greek sculptures followed, notably the first purpose-built exhibition space, the [[Charles Towneley|Charles Towneley collection]], much of it Roman Sculpture, in 1805. In 1806, [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin]], ambassador to the [[Ottoman Empire]] from 1799 to 1803 removed the large collection of marble sculptures from the [[Parthenon]], on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]] in Athens and transferred them to the UK. In 1816 these masterpieces of western art, were acquired by The British Museum by Act of Parliament and deposited in the museum thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;The British Museum – The Elgin Marbles, p. 85 (B.F.Cook, 2005, ISBN 0-7141-2134-7&lt;/ref&gt; The collections were supplemented by the [[Bassae]] frieze from [[Phigalia|Phigaleia]], [[Greece]] in 1815. The Ancient Near Eastern collection also had its beginnings in 1825 with the purchase of [[Assyria]]n and [[Babylonia]]n antiquities from the widow of [[Claudius James Rich]].&lt;ref&gt;The British Museum – Assyrian Sculpture, pp. 6–7 (Julian Reade, 2004, ISBN 0-7141-2141-X)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802 a Buildings Committee was set up to plan for expansion of the museum, and further highlighted by the donation in 1822 of the [[King's Library]], personal library of King George III's, comprising 65,000 volumes, 19,000 [[pamphlet]]s, maps, charts and [[Topographic map|topographical drawings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/findhelprestype/prbooks/georgeiiicoll/george3kingslibrary.html |title=King's Library|publisher=Bl|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] architect, [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Sir Robert Smirke]], was asked to draw up plans for an eastern extension to the Museum &quot;...&amp;nbsp;for the reception of the [[Royal Library, Windsor|Royal Library]], and a Picture Gallery over it ...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, David, M. (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; and put forward plans for today's quadrangular building, much of which can be seen today. The dilapidated Old [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]] was demolished and work on the [[King's Library]] Gallery began in 1823. The extension, the East Wing, was completed by 1831. However, following the founding of the [[National Gallery, London]] in 1824,{{Ref label|E|e|none}} the proposed Picture Gallery was no longer needed, and the space on the upper floor was given over to the [[Natural history]] collections.&lt;ref&gt;The Story of the British Museum, p. 25 (Marjorie Caygill, 2003, ISBN 0-7141-2772-8)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The largest building site in Europe (1825–50)===
[[File:Image-The Grenville Library (1875).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Thomas Grenville|Grenville]] Library, 1875]]
The Museum became a construction site as [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Sir Robert Smirke]]'s grand [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] building gradually arose. The [[King's Library]], on the ground floor of the East Wing, was handed over in 1827, and was described as one of the finest rooms in London although it was not fully open to the general public until 1857, however, special openings were arranged during [[The Great Exhibition]] of 1851. In spite of dirt and disruption the collections grew, outpacing the new building.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

;Archaeological excavations

In 1840 the Museum became involved in its first overseas [[excavation (archeology)|excavation]]s, [[Charles Fellows]]'s expedition to [[Xanthos]], in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]], whence came remains of the tombs of the rulers of ancient [[Lycia]], among them the [[Nereid Monument|Nereid]] and [[Tomb of Payava|Payava]] monuments. In 1857 [[Charles Thomas Newton|Charles Newton]] was to discover the 4th-century BC [[Mausoleum of Maussollos|Mausoleum of Halikarnassos]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]]. In the 1840s and 1850s the Museum supported excavations in [[Assyria]] by [[Austen Henry Layard|A.H. Layard]] and others at sites such as [[Nimrud]] and [[Nineveh]]. Of particular interest to curators was the eventual discovery of [[Ashurbanipal]]'s great library of [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]], which helped to make the Museum a focus for [[Assyriology|Assyrian studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Reade, Julian (2004). Assyrian Sculpture. London: The British Museum Press, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Grenville|Sir Thomas Grenville]] (1755–1846), a Trustee of The British Museum from 1830, assembled a fine library of 20,240 volumes, which he left to the Museum in his will. The books arrived in January 1847 in twenty-one horse-drawn vans. The only vacant space for this large library was a room originally intended for manuscripts, between the Front Entrance Hall and the Manuscript Saloon. The books remained here until the British Library moved to [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]] in 1998.

===Collecting from the wider world (1850–75)===
The opening of the forecourt in 1852 marked the completion of [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]]'s 1823 plan, but already adjustments were having to be made to cope with the unforeseen growth of the collections. Infill galleries were constructed for [[Assyria]]n sculptures and [[Sydney Smirke]]'s [[British Museum Reading Room|Round Reading Room]], with space for a million books, opened in 1857. Because of continued pressure on space the decision was taken to move natural history to a new building in [[South Kensington]], which would later become the [[Natural History Museum, London|British Museum of Natural History]].

Roughly contemporary with the construction of the new building was the career of a man sometimes called the &quot;second founder&quot; of the British Museum, the Italian librarian [[Anthony Panizzi]]. Under his supervision, the British Museum Library (now the [[British Library]]) quintupled in size and became a well-organised institution worthy of being called a national library, the largest library in the world after the [[National Library of Paris]].&lt;ref name=&quot;world and its people&quot;/&gt; The [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] at the centre of Smirke's design proved to be a waste of valuable space and was filled at Panizzi's request by a circular Reading Room of cast iron, designed by Smirke's brother, Sydney Smirke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Charles Dickens, Jr.|Dickens, Charles, Jr.]]|year=1879|title=Museum, British|work=[[Dickens's Dictionary of London]]|url=http://www.victorianlondon.org/dickens/dickens-mus.htm|accessdate=22 August 2007|quote=Beyond the new Lycian room is the READING ROOM: [...] ; circular structure; original suggestion of Thomas Watts, improved by A. (Sir A.) Panizzi, carried out by Mr. Sidney Smirke; [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the mid-19th century, the Museum's collections were relatively circumscribed but, in 1851, with the appointment to the staff of [[Augustus Wollaston Franks]] to curate the collections, the Museum began for the first time to collect British and European medieval antiquities, [[prehistory]], branching out into Asia and diversifying its holdings of [[ethnography]]. Overseas excavations continued and [[John Turtle Wood]] discovered the remains of the 4th century BC [[Temple of Artemis]] at [[Ephesus|Ephesos]], another [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World|Wonder of the Ancient World]].&lt;ref&gt;South from Ephesus – An Escape From The Tyranny of Western Art, pp. 33–34,(Brian Sewell, 2002, ISBN 1-903933-16-1)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholarship and legacies (1875–1900)===
[[File:Брытанскі музей 2014 27.JPG|thumb|250px|Display case of Renaissance metalware from the [[Waddesdon Bequest]], 2014]]
The natural history collections were an integral part of the British Museum until their removal to the new British Museum of Natural History, now the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], in 1887. With the departure and the completion of the new White Wing (fronting Montague Street) in 1884, more space was available for antiquities and [[ethnography]] and the library could further expand. This was a time of innovation as electric lighting was introduced in the Reading Room and exhibition galleries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The Electric Light in the British Museum – Excerpt from The Times, 25 November 18 December 1879 1879|work=New York Times|date=18 December 1879|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&amp;res=9A0CE1DC163EE63BBC4052DFB4678382669FDE&amp;oref=slogin|format=PDF|accessdate=12 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882 the Museum was involved in the establishment of the independent [[Egypt Exploration Fund]] (now Society) the first British body to carry out research in Egypt. A bequest from Miss Emma Turner in 1892 financed excavations in Cyprus. In 1897 the death of the great collector and curator, [[Augustus Wollaston Franks|A.W. Franks]], was followed by an immense bequest of 3,300 [[Ring (finger)|finger rings]], 153 drinking vessels, 512 pieces of continental porcelain, 1,500 [[netsuke]], 850 [[inro]], over 30,000 [[bookplates]] and miscellaneous items of jewellery and plate, among them the [[Oxus Treasure]].&lt;ref&gt;Caygill, Marjorie (2006). The British Museum: 250 Years. London: The British Museum Press, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898 [[Ferdinand James von Rothschild|Baron Ferdinand de Rothschild]] bequeathed the glittering contents from his New Smoking Room at [[Waddesdon Manor]] as the [[Waddesdon Bequest]]. This consisted of almost 300 pieces of ''[[objets d'art]] et de vertu'' which included exquisite examples of jewellery, plate, enamel, carvings, glass and [[maiolica]], among them the [[Holy Thorn Reliquary]], probably created in the 1390s in Paris for [[John, Duke of Berry]]. The collection was in the tradition of a [[schatzkammer]] or treasure house such as those formed by the [[Renaissance]] princes of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;rothschild&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title =Creating a Great Museum: Early Collectors and The British Museum|first=Marjorie|last=Caygill|publisher=Fathom|url=http://www.fathom.com/course/21701728/session4.html|accessdate =13 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baron Ferdinand's will was most specific, and failure to observe the terms would make it void, the collection should be
{{quote|placed in a special room to be called the Waddesdon Bequest Room separate and apart from the other contents of the Museum and thenceforth for ever thereafter, keep the same in such room or in some other room to be substituted for it.&lt;ref name=&quot;rothschild&quot;/&gt;}}  These terms are still observed, and the collection occupies room 45, although it will move to new quarters in 2015.

===New century, new building (1900–25)===

[[File:Woolley holding the hardened plaster mold of a lyre.jpg|thumb|Sir [[Leonard Woolley]] holding the famous excavated [[Sumer]]ian Queen's [[Lyre]], 1922]]
By the last years of the 19th century, The British Museum's collections had increased so much that the Museum building was no longer big enough for them. In 1895 the trustees purchased the 69 houses surrounding the Museum with the intention of demolishing them and building around the West, North and East sides of the Museum. The first stage was the construction of the northern wing beginning 1906.

All the while, the collections kept growing. Emily Torday collected in Central Africa, [[Marc Aurel Stein|Aurel Stein]] in Central Asia, [[David George Hogarth|D.G. Hogarth]], [[Leonard Woolley]] and [[T. E. Lawrence]] excavated at [[Carchemish]]. In 1918, because of the threat of wartime bombing, some objects were evacuated to a Postal Tube Railway at Holborn, the [[National Library of Wales|National Library of Wales (Aberystwyth)]] and a country house near [[Malvern, Worcestershire|Malvern]]. On the return of antiquities from wartime storage in 1919 some objects were found to have deteriorated. A temporary conservation laboratory was set up in May 1920 and became a permanent department in 1931. It is today the oldest in continuous existence.&lt;ref&gt;Permanent establishment of the Research Laboratory (now the oldest such establishment in continuous existence) {{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/conservation_and_scientific/history.aspx|title=History|work=British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 the British Museum welcomed over one million visitors.

===Disruption and reconstruction (1925–50)===
New [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] floors were constructed and book stacks rebuilt in an attempt to cope with the flood of books. In 1931 the art dealer [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen of Millbank|Sir Joseph Duveen]] offered funds to build a gallery for the [[Elgin Marbles|Parthenon sculptures]]. Designed by the American architect [[John Russell Pope]], it was completed in 1938. The appearance of the exhibition galleries began to change as dark Victorian reds gave way to modern pastel shades.{{Ref label|F|f|none}} However, in August 1939, due to the imminence of war and the likelihood of air-raids the Parthenon Sculptures along with Museum's most valued collections were dispersed to secure basements, [[country house]]s, [[Aldwych tube station]], the [[National Library of Wales]] and a quarry. The evacuation was timely, for in 1940 the Duveen Gallery was severely damaged by bombing.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, B.F. (2005). The Elgin Marbles. London: The British Museum Press, pg 92&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum continued to collect from all countries and all centuries: among the most spectacular additions were the 2600 BC [[Mesopotamia]]n treasure from [[Ur]], discovered during [[Leonard Woolley]]'s 1922–34 excavations. Gold, silver and [[garnet]] grave goods from the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] ship burial at [[Sutton Hoo]] (1939) and late Roman silver tableware from [[Mildenhall Treasure|Mildenhall]], Suffolk (1946). The immediate [[post-war]] years were taken up with the return of the collections from protection and the restoration of the museum after the [[The Blitz|blitz]]. Work also began on restoring the damaged Duveen Gallery.

===A new public face (1950–75)===
[[File:The Duveen Gallery (1980s).jpg|thumb|The re-opened [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen|Duveen]] Gallery, 1980]]

In 1953 the Museum celebrated its [[200 (number)|bicentenary]]. Many changes followed: the first full-time in house designer and publications officer were appointed in 1964, A [[The British Museum Friends|Friends]] organisation was set up in 1968, an Education Service established in 1970 and publishing house in 1973. In 1963 a new Act of Parliament introduced administrative reforms. It became easier to lend objects, the constitution of the [[Board of Trustees]] changed and the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] became fully independent. By 1959 the Coins and Medals office suite, completely destroyed during the war, was rebuilt and re-opened, attention turned towards the gallery work with new tastes in design leading to the remodelling of [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke's]] Classical and Near Eastern galleries.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, David, M. (2002). The British Museum: A History. London: The British Museum Press, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; In 1962 the Duveen Gallery was finally restored and the Parthenon Sculptures were moved back into it, once again at the heart of the museum.{{Ref label|G|g|none}}

By the 1970s the Museum was again expanding. More services for the public were introduced; visitor numbers soared, with the temporary exhibition &quot;Treasures of [[Tutankhamun]]&quot; in 1972, attracting 1,694,117 visitors, the most successful in British history. In the same year the Act of Parliament establishing the British Library was passed, separating the collection of [[manuscripts]] and printed books from the British Museum. This left the Museum with antiquities; coins, medals and paper money; prints &amp; drawings; and [[ethnography]]. A pressing problem was finding space for additions to the library which now required an extra 1{{fraction|1|4}} miles of shelving each year. The Government suggested a site at [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]] for the new British Library but the books did not leave the museum until 1997.

===The Great Court emerges (1975–2000)===
The departure of the British Library to a new site at St Pancras, finally achieved in 1998, provided the space needed for the books. It also created the opportunity to redevelop the vacant space in [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke's]] 19th-century central quadrangle into the [[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court]] – the largest covered square in Europe – which opened in 2000.

The ethnography collections, which had been housed in the short-lived [[Museum of Mankind]] at 6 Burlington Gardens from 1970, were returned to new purpose-built galleries.

The Museum again readjusted its collecting policies as interest in &quot;modern&quot; objects: prints, drawings, medals and the decorative arts reawakened. Ethnographical fieldwork was carried out in places as diverse as [[New Guinea]], [[Madagascar]], [[Romania]], [[Guatemala]] and [[Indonesia]] and there were excavations in the [[Near East]], Egypt, Sudan and the UK. The [[Weston family|Weston]] Gallery of Roman Britain, opened in 1997, displayed a number of recently discovered [[hoard]]s which demonstrated the richness of what had been considered an unimportant part of the Roman Empire. The Museum turned increasingly towards private funds for buildings, acquisitions and other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, David, M. (2002). The British Museum: A History.

===The Museum today===
[[File:BP Lecture Theatre British Museum (3).jpg|thumbnail|right|The [[BP]] Lecture Theatre at the museum, part of the Clore Centre for Education, 2013]]
Today the museum no longer houses collections of [[natural history]], and the books and manuscripts it once held now form part of the independent British Library. The Museum nevertheless preserves its universality in its collections of artefacts representing the cultures of the world, ancient and modern. The original 1753 collection has grown to over thirteen million objects at the British Museum, 70 million at the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] and 150 million at the British Library.

The [[British Museum Reading Room|Round Reading Room]], which was designed by the architect [[Sydney Smirke]], opened in 1857. For almost 150 years researchers came here to consult the Museum's vast library. The Reading Room closed in 1997 when the national library (the British Library) moved to a new building at [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]]. Today it has been transformed into the Walter and Leonore [[Annenberg Foundation|Annenberg]] Centre.

With the bookstacks in the central courtyard of the museum empty, the process of demolition for [[Lord Foster]]'s glass-roofed [[Queen Elizabeth II Great Court|Great Court]] could begin. The Great Court, opened in 2000, while undoubtedly improving circulation around the museum, was criticised for having a lack of exhibition space at a time when the museum was in serious financial difficulties and many galleries were closed to the public. At the same time the African collections that had been temporarily housed in 6 Burlington Gardens were given a new gallery in the North Wing funded by the [[David Sainsbury, Baron Sainsbury of Turville|Sainsbury]] family – with the donation valued at £25 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/galleries/africa/room_25_africa.aspx |title=Room 25: Africa|work=British Museum|date=14 June 2010|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its very large website, the museum has the largest online database of objects in the collection of any museum in the world, with 2,000,000 individual object entries, 650,000 of them illustrated, online at the start of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database.aspx |title=Search the collection database |publisher=Britishmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a &quot;Highlights&quot; database with longer entries on over 4,000 objects, and several specialised online research catalogues and online journals (all free to access).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights.aspx Highlights] British Museum, [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/online_research_catalogues.aspx online research catalogues] British Museum and [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/online_journals.aspx online journals] British Museum&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 the museum's website received 19.5 millions visits, an increase of 47% from the previous year.&lt;ref name=BBC_museum# /&gt;

==Governance==
The British Museum is a [[non-departmental public body]] sponsored by the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] through a three-year funding agreement. Its head is the [[Director of the British Museum|Director]]. The British Museum was run from its inception by a 'Principal Librarian' (when the book collections were still part of the Museum), a role that was renamed 'Director and Principal Librarian' in 1898, and 'Director' in 1973 (on the separation of the British Library).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/the_museum/about_us/management_and_governance/directors.aspx|title=Directors |work=British Museum|date=14 June 2010|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A board of [[List of trustees of the British Museum|25 trustees]] (with the Director as their [[Chief accounting officer|accounting officer]] for the purposes of reporting to Government) is responsible for the general management and control of the Museum, in accordance with the [[British Museum Act]] 1963 and the [[Museums and Galleries Act 1992]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/the_museum/about_us/management_and_governance/museum_governance.aspx |title=Museum governance|work=British Museum|date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 1963 Act, it was chaired by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], the [[Lord Chancellor]] and the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]]. The board was formed on the Museum's inception to [[trust law|hold its collections in trust]] for the nation without actually owning them themselves, and now fulfil a mainly advisory role. [[Trustee]] appointments are governed by the regulatory framework set out in the code of practice on public appointments issued by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/management/trustees/becoming_a_trustee.aspx |title=Becoming a Trustee |work=British Museum |accessdate=1 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==
[[File:British museum entrance.jpg|thumb|The main entrance to the museum, with Greek temple style [[portico]], 2007]]
The [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] façade facing Great Russell Street is a characteristic building of Sir [[Robert Smirke (architect)|Robert Smirke]], with 44 columns in the [[Ionic order]] {{convert|45|ft|m|abbr=on}} high, closely based on those of the temple of [[Athena|Athena Polias]] at [[Priene]] in [[Asia Minor]]. The [[pediment]] over the main entrance is decorated by sculptures by Sir [[Richard Westmacott]] depicting ''The Progress of Civilisation'', consisting of fifteen [[Allegory|allegorical]] figures, installed in 1852.

The construction commenced around the courtyard with the East Wing ([[King's Library|The King's Library]]) in 1823–1828, followed by the North Wing in 1833–1838, which originally housed among other galleries a reading room, now the Wellcome Gallery. Work was also progressing on the northern half of the West Wing (The Egyptian Sculpture Gallery) 1826–1831, with [[Montagu House, Bloomsbury|Montagu House]] demolished in 1842 to make room for the final part of the West Wing, completed in 1846, and the South Wing with its great colonnade, initiated in 1843 and completed in 1847, when the Front Hall and Great Staircase were opened to the public.&lt;ref&gt;Building the British Museum, Marjorie Caygill &amp; Christopher Date 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum is faced with [[Portland stone]], but the perimeter walls and other parts of the building were built using [[Haytor]] granite from Dartmoor in South Devon, transported via the unique [[Haytor Granite Tramway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.es.ucl.ac.uk/department/collections/RockRoom/building.htm|title=Building London |publisher=UCL|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1846 Robert Smirke was replaced as the Museum's architect by his brother [[Sydney Smirke]], whose major addition was the [[British Museum Reading Room|Round Reading Room]] 1854–1857; at {{convert|140|ft|m}} in diameter it was then the second widest dome in the world, the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in Rome being slightly wider.

The next major addition was the White Wing 1882–1884 added behind the eastern end of the South Front, the architect being Sir [[John Taylor (architect)|John Taylor]].

In 1895, Parliament gave the Museum Trustees a loan of £200,000 to purchase from the Duke of Bedford all 69 houses which backed onto the Museum building in the five surrounding streets – Great Russell Street, Montague Street, Montague Place, Bedford Square and Bloomsbury Street.&lt;ref&gt;Title deed of the 'perimeter properties' of The British Museum, BM Archives CA TD&lt;/ref&gt; The Trustees planned to demolish these houses and to build around the West, North and East sides of the Museum new galleries that would completely fill the block on which the Museum stands. The architect Sir [[John James Burnet]] was petitioned to put forward ambitious long-term plans to extend the building on all three sides. Most of the houses in Montague Place were knocked down a few years after the sale. Of this grand plan only the Edward VII galleries in the centre of the North Front were ever constructed, these were built 1906–14 to the design by J.J. Burnet, and opened by [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]] in 1914. They now house the Museum's collections of Prints and Drawings and Oriental Antiquities. There was not enough money to put up more new buildings, and so the houses in the other streets are nearly all still standing.

The [[Joseph Duveen, 1st Baron Duveen of Millbank|Duveen]] Gallery, sited to the west of the Egyptian, Greek &amp; Assyrian sculpture galleries, was designed to house the Elgin Marbles by the American [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] architect [[John Russell Pope]]. Although completed in 1938, it was hit by a bomb in 1940 and remained semi-derelict for 22 years, before reopening in 1962. Other areas damaged during [[World War II]] bombing included: in September 1940 two unexploded bombs hit the Edward VII galleries, the King's Library received a direct hit from a high explosive bomb, incendiaries fell on the dome of the Round Reading Room but did little damage; on the night of 10 to 11 May 1941 several incendiaries fell on the south west corner of the Museum, destroying the book stack and 150,000 books in the courtyard and the galleries around the top of the Great Staircase – this damage was not fully repaired until the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 65–66, Building the British Museum, Marjorie Caygill &amp; Christopher Date 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

At the centre of the Great Court is the Reading Room vacated by the British Library, its functions now moved to St Pancras. The Reading Room is open to any member of the public who wishes to read there.

Today, the British Museum has grown to become one of the largest museums in the world, covering an area of over 92,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (990,000 sq. ft).&lt;ref name=&quot;britishmuseum.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://planningonline.camden.gov.uk/MULTIWAM/doc/Supporting%20Documents-2692368.pdf?extension=.pdf&amp;id=2692368&amp;location=VOLUME3&amp;contentType=application/pdf&amp;pageCount=1&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to 21,600&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (232,000 sq. ft)&lt;ref name=&quot;museumsassociation.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumsassociation.org/news/26012011-cross-calls-for-new-debate-on-stored-collections |title=Cross calls for new debate on stored collections|publisher=Museums Association|date=26 January 2011|accessdate=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of on-site storage space, and 9,400&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (101,000 sq. ft)&lt;ref name=&quot;museumsassociation.org&quot;/&gt; of external storage space.

This project was announced in July 2007, with the architects [[Richard Rogers|Rogers Stirk Harbour and Partners]].

The British Museum houses the world's largest{{Ref label|H|h|none}} and most comprehensive collection of [[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian antiquities]] (with over 100,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/ancient_egypt_and_sudan/history_of_the_collection/development_of_the_collection/development_since_world_war_ii.aspx |title=Development since World War II (1945 – )|work=British Museum|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; pieces) outside the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]]. A collection of immense importance for its range and quality, it includes objects of all periods from virtually every site of importance in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]] and the [[History of Sudan|Sudan]]. Together they illustrate every aspect of the cultures of the [[Nile|Nile Valley]] (including [[Nubia]]), from the [[Predynastic Egypt|Predynastic]] [[Neolithic]] period (c. 10,000 [[Anno Domini|BC]]) through to the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic (Christian)]] times (12th century [[Anno Domini|AD]]), a time-span over 11,000 years.

[[Art of Ancient Egypt|Egyptian antiquities]] have formed part of the British Museum collection ever since its foundation in 1753 after receiving 160 Egyptian objects&lt;ref&gt;Reported in the list of Sloane's collection given to his executors in 1753. Reproduced in MacGregor (1994a:29)&lt;/ref&gt; from Sir [[Hans Sloane]]. After the defeat of the [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1799|French]] forces under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] at the [[Battle of the Nile]] in 1801, the Egyptian antiquities collected were confiscated by the [[British army]] and presented to the British Museum in 1803. These works, which included the famed [[Rosetta Stone]], were the first important group of large sculptures to be acquired by the Museum. Thereafter, the UK appointed [[Henry Salt (Egyptologist)|Henry Salt]] as [[Consul general|consul]] in Egypt who amassed a huge collection of antiquities. Most of the antiquities Salt collected were purchased by the British Museum and the [[Musée du Louvre]]. By 1866 the collection consisted of some 10,000 objects. Antiquities from excavations started to come to the Museum in the later 19th century as a result of the work of the [[Egypt Exploration Society|Egypt Exploration Fund]] under the efforts of [[E. A. Wallis Budge|E.A. Wallis Budge]]. The collection stood at 57,000 objects by 1924. Active support by the Museum for excavations in Egypt continued to result in useful acquisitions throughout the 20th century until changes in antiquities laws in Egypt led to the suspension of policies allowing finds to be exported. The size of the Egyptian collections now stands at over 110,000 objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/spencer.htm|title=A British Museum Egyptologist's View: The Return of Egyptian Antiquities is Not an Issue|publisher=Touregypt|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In autumn 2001 the eight million objects forming the Museum's permanent collection were further expanded by the addition of six million objects from the Wendorf Collection of [[Predynastic Egypt|Egyptian]] and [[History of Sudan|Sudanese]] [[Prehistory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/aes/aesnot.html|title=Ancient Egypt and Sudan|work=British Museum|date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were donated by Professor Fred Wendorf of [[Southern Methodist University]] in [[Texas]], and comprise the entire collection of artefacts and environmental remains from his excavations between 1963 and 1997. They are in the care of the Department of Ancient Egypt and Sudan.

The seven permanent Egyptian galleries at the British Museum, which include its largest exhibition space (Room 4, for monumental sculpture), can display only 4% of its Egyptian holdings. The second-floor galleries have a selection of the Museum's collection of 140 [[Mummy|mummies]] and coffins, the largest outside [[Egyptian Museum|Cairo]].

Formerly the Department of the Ancient Near East, with a collection numbering some 330,000 works,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/middle_east/research.aspx British Museum – Research&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the British Museum possesses by far the world's largest and most important collection of [[Mesopotamia]]n antiquities outside [[Iraq]]. A collection of immense importance, the holdings of [[Assyria]]n, [[Babylonia]]n and [[Sumer]]ian antiquities are among the most comprehensive in the world with entire suites of rooms panelled in alabaster bas-reliefs from highly important sites between the rivers [[Euphrates]] and [[Tigris]] and include the biblical cities of [[Nimrud]], [[Nineveh]] and [[Khorsabad]].

The collections represent the civilisations of the ancient Near East and its adjacent areas. These include [[Mesopotamia]], [[Iran|Persia]], the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Anatolia]], the [[Caucasus]], parts of Central Asia, [[Syria]], [[Palestine]] and [[Phoenicia]]n settlements in the western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] from the [[Prehistory|prehistoric period]] until the beginning of [[Islam]] in the 7th century. The collection includes six iconic [[Lamassu|winged human-headed statues]] from [[Nimrud]] and [[Khorsabad]]. Stone [[bas-relief]]s, including the famous Royal Lion Hunt relief's (Room 10), that were found in the palaces of the Assyrian kings at [[Nimrud]] and [[Nineveh]]. The [[Library of Ashurbanipal|Royal Library of Ashurbanipal]] at Nineveh and [[Sumer]]ian treasures found in Royal Cemetery's at [[Ur Kasdim|Ur of the Chaldees]].

The earliest [[Mesopotamian]] objects to enter the collection were purchased by the British Museum in 1772 from [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]]. The Museum also acquired at this early date a number of sculptures from [[Persepolis]]. The next significant addition (in 1825) was from the collection of [[Claudius James Rich]]. The collection was dramatically enlarged by the excavations of [[Austen Henry Layard|A. H. Layard]] at the [[Assyria]]n sites of [[Nimrud]] and [[Nineveh]] between 1845 and 1851.

[[File:London 307.JPG|thumbnail|Room 52 - Ancient Iran with the [[Cyrus Cylinder]], considered to be the world's first charter of [[human rights]], 559-530 BC]]
At Nimrud, Layard discovered the North-West Palace of [[Ashurnasirpal II]], as well as three other palaces and various temples. He also opened in the Palace of [[Sennacherib]] at Nineveh with 'no less than seventy-one halls'. As a result a large numbers of [[Lamassu]]'s, bas-reliefs, [[Stele|stelae]], including the [[Black Obelisk]] of [[Shalmaneser III]] were brought to the British Museum. Layard's work was continued by his assistant, [[Hormuzd Rassam]] and in 1852–1854 he went on to discover the North Palace of Ashurbanipal at Nineveh with many magnificent reliefs, including the famous Royal Lion Hunt scenes. He also discovered the [[Library of Ashurbanipal|Royal Library of Ashurbanipal]], a large collection of [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]] of enormous importance. [[William Loftus|W. K. Loftus]] excavated in Nimrud between 1850 and 1855 and found a remarkable hoard of [[Ivory carving|ivories]] in the Burnt Palace. Between 1878 and 1882 Rassam greatly improved the Museum's holdings with exquisite objects including the [[Cyrus Cylinder]] from [[Babylon]], the bronze gates from [[Balawat]], and a fine collection of [[Urartian]] bronzes. Rassam collected thousands of cuneiform tablets, today with the acquisition of further tablets in the 20th century, the collection now numbers around 130,000 pieces. In the 20th century excavations were carried out at [[Carchemish]], [[Turkey]], between 1911 and 1914 and in 1920 by [[David George Hogarth|D. G. Hogarth]] and [[Leonard Woolley]], the latter assisted by [[T. E. Lawrence]]. The Mesopotamian collections were greatly augmented by excavations in southern [[Iraq]] after the [[First World War]]. From [[Ubaid period|Tell al-Ubaid]] in 1919 and 1923–1924, directed by [[Henry Hall (Egyptologist)|H. R. Hall]] came the bronze furnishings of a [[Sumer]]ian temple, including life-sized lions and a panel featuring the lion-headed eagle Indugud. Woolley went onto to excavate [[Ur]] between 1922 and 1934, discovering the 'Royal Cemeteries' of the 3rd millennium BC. Some of the masterpieces include the '[[Standard of Ur]]', the 'Ram in a Thicket', the '[[Royal Game of Ur]]', and two bull-headed [[lyres]].

Although the collections centre on Mesopotamia most of the surrounding areas are well represented. The [[Achaemenid]] collection was enhanced with the addition of the [[Oxus Treasure]] in 1897, by acquisition from the German scholar [[Ernst Herzfeld]], and then by the work of [[Marc Aurel Stein|Sir Aurel Stein]]. From [[Palmyra]] there is a large collection of nearly forty funerary busts, acquired in the 19th century. A group of stone [[reliefs]] from the excavations of [[Max von Oppenheim]] at [[Tell Halaf]], purchased in 1920. More excavated material from the excavations of [[Max Mallowan]] at [[Chagar Bazar]] and [[Tell Brak]] in 1935–1938, and from Woolley at [[Alalakh]] in the years just before and after the [[Second World War]]. The collection of [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] material was strengthened with the acquisition in 1980 of around 17,000 objects found at [[Lachish]] by the Wellcome-Marston expedition of 1932–1938.

A representative selection, including the most important pieces, are on display in 13 galleries and total some 4500 objects. The remainder form the study collection which ranges in size from beads to large sculptures. They include approximately 130,000 [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] [[Clay tablet|tablets]] from Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/middle_east/history_of_the_collection.aspx |title=History of the Collection: Middle East|work=British Museu |date=14 June 2010|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It ranks as one of the largest and best [[print room]] collections in existence alongside the [[Albertina, Vienna|Albertina]] in Vienna, the Paris collections and the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]]. The holdings are easily accessible to the general public in the Study Room, unlike many such collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/prints_and_drawings/facilities_and_services/study_room.aspx |title=Study room page|work=British Museum|date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department also has its own exhibition gallery in Room 90, where the displays and exhibitions change several times a year.&lt;ref name=bmgal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/prints_and_drawings/galleries.aspx|title=Prints and Drawings galleries |work=British Museum|date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its foundation in 1808 the Prints and Drawings collection has grown to international renown as one of the richest and most representative collections in the world. There are approximately 50,000 drawings and over two million prints.&lt;ref name=bmgal/&gt; The collection of drawings covers the period from the 14th century to the present, and includes many works of the highest quality by the leading artists of the [[Western art history|European schools]]. The collection of prints covers the tradition of fine [[printmaking]] from its beginnings in the 15th century up to the present, with near complete holdings of most of the great names before the 19th century.

There are groups of drawings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Raphael]], [[Michelangelo]], (including [[Epifania (Michelangelo drawing)|his only surviving full-scale cartoon)]], [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]] (a collection of 138 drawings is one of the finest in existence), [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Claude Lorrain|Claude]] and [[Antoine Watteau|Watteau]], and largely complete collections of the works of all the great printmakers including [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]] (99 [[engraving]]s, 6 [[etching]]s and most of his 346 [[woodcut]]s), Rembrandt and [[Francisco Goya|Goya]]. More than 30,000 British drawings and [[Watercolor painting|watercolours]] include important examples of work by [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]], [[Paul Sandby|Sandby]], [[J. M. W. Turner|Turner]], [[Thomas Girtin|Girtin]], [[John Constable|Constable]], [[John Sell Cotman|Cotman]], [[David Cox (artist)|Cox]], [[James Gillray|Gillray]], [[Thomas Rowlandson|Rowlandson]] and [[George Cruikshank|Cruikshank]], as well as all the great [[Victorian era|Victorians]]. There are about a million British prints including more than 20,000 satires and outstanding collections of works by [[William Blake]] and [[Thomas Bewick]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. The great eleven volume [[Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum]] compiled between 1870 and 1954 is the definitive reference work for the study of British Satirical prints. Over 500,000 objects from the department are now on the online collection database, many with high quality images.&lt;ref&gt;Searches on 8 January 2012 return totals of 700,000, but many are in other departments&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 donation of £1 million enabled the museum to acquire a complete set of [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Vollard Suite]]''.&lt;ref name='TelegNov11'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/8923722/City-fund-manager-in-1m-Picasso-giveaway.html|title=City fund manager in £1m Picasso giveaway|work=The Daily Telegraph|author=Anita Singh|accessdate=19 May 2012|date=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Room 39 British Museum.jpg|thumb|Room 39 - Clocks and watches exhibition space]]
The Department of Prehistory and Europe is responsible for collections that cover a vast expanse of time and geography. It includes some of the earliest objects made by humans in east Africa over 2 million years ago, as well as [[prehistoric]] and [[neolithic]] objects from other parts of the world; and the art and archaeology of Europe from the earliest times to the present day. It also includes the national collection of [[horology]] with one of the most wide ranging assemblage of clocks, watches and other timepieces in Europe, with masterpieces from every period in the development of time-keeping. In particular, the British Museum's collections covering the period AD 300 to 1100 are among the largest and most comprehensive in the world, extending from Spain to the [[Black Sea]] and from North Africa to [[Scandinavia]], and that have recently been rehoused in a newly refurbished gallery. The Department is also responsible for the curation of [[Romano-British]] objects – the museum has by far the most extensive such collection in Britain and one of the most representative regional collections in Europe outside [[Italy]]. It is particularly famous for the large number of late Roman silver treasures, many of which were found in [[East Anglia]], the most important of which is the [[Mildenhall Treasure]].

[[File:Room 95-6752.JPG|thumb|Room 95 –  The Sir [[Sir Percival David, 2nd Baronet|Percival David]] collection of Chinese ceramics]]
The scope of the Department of Asia is extremely broad, its collections of over 75,000 objects covers the material culture of the whole Asian continent (from East, South, Central and South-East Asia) and from the Neolithic up to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Babs.Guthrie |url=http://www.untoldlondon.org.uk/collections/SE000073.html |title=Collection page|publisher=Untold London|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.emb-japan.go.jp/en/japaninfo/culture/britishmuseum.html|title=Embassy of Japan in the UK|publisher=Japan Embassy|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/asia.aspx |title=Department of Asia|work=British Museum|date=14 June 2010|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the ethnographic collections from Asia were transferred to the department. These reflect the diverse environment of the largest continent in the world and range from India to China, the Middle East to Japan. Much of the ethnographic material comes from objects originally owned by tribal cultures and [[hunter-gatherers]], many of whose way of life has disappeared in the last century. Particularly valuable collections are from the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]], Sri Lanka, Northern Thailand, south-west China, the [[Ainu people|Ainu]] of Hokaidu in Japan, Siberia and the islands of South-East Asia, especially Borneo. A unique group of objects from Java, including shadow puppets and a [[gamelan]] musical set collected by [[Sir Stamford Raffles]], is also in the collection.

Key highlights of the Department include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/departments_all_relationships.aspx?Title=Asia&amp;ContentType=Department&amp;PageId=551|title=Department of Asia – Related Highlight Objects|work=British Museum|date=14 June 2010|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Department of Africa, Oceania and the Americas===

The British Museum houses one of the world's most comprehensive collections of [[Ethnographic]] material from Africa, Oceania and the Americas, representing the cultures of [[indigenous peoples]] throughout the world. Over 350,000 objects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/the_museum/departments/africa,_oceania_and_americas.aspx|title=Africa, Oceania and the Americas|work=British Museum|date=14 June 2010|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; spanning two million years tells the story of the history of man, from three major continents and many rich and diverse cultures; the collecting of modern artefacts is ongoing.

'''Africa'''
[[File:Room 25 British Museum.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Room 25 - African pots on display in the gallery]]
The Sainsbury African Galleries display 600 objects from the greatest permanent collection of African arts and culture in the world. The three permanent galleries provide a substantial exhibition space for the Museum's African collection comprising over 200,000 objects. A curatorial scope that encompasses both archaeological and contemporary material, including both unique masterpieces of artistry and objects of everyday life. Highlights of the African collection include the [[Benin Bronzes]], the beautiful [[Bronze Head of Queen Idia]], a magnificent [[Bronze Head from Ife|brass head]] of a Yoruba ruler from [[Ife]], the [[Apapa Hoard]] from Lagos, southern Nigeria, Asante goldwork from Ghana including the [[Thomas Edward Bowdich|Bowdich]] collection, the rare [[Akan Drum]] from the same region in West Africa, a series of soapstone figures from the [[Kissi people]] in Sierra Leone and Liberia, the [[Emil Torday|Torday]] collection of Central African sculpture, textiles and weaponry, important material from Ethiopia following the [[British Expedition to Abyssinia]], the unique [[Luzira Head]] from Uganda, excavated objects from [[Great Zimbabwe]] and satellite towns such as [[Mutare]] including a large hoard of Iron Age soapstone figures, and cave paintings and [[petroglyph]]s from [[Wildebeest Kuil Rock Art Centre|South Africa]].

'''Oceania'''

The British Museum's Oceanic collections originate from the vast area of the [[Pacific Ocean]], stretching from Papua New Guinea to Easter Island, from New Zealand to Hawaii. The three main anthropological groups represented in the collection are [[Polynesia]], [[Melanesia]] and [[Micronesia]] – Aboriginal art from Australia is considered separately in its own right.  Metal working was not indigenous to Oceania before Europeans arrived, so many of the artefacts from the collection are made from stone, shell, bone and bamboo. The British Museum is fortunate in having some of the earliest objects made in Oceania in its collections, many of which were collected by members of [[James Cook|Cook]]'s and [[George Vancouver|Vancouver]]'s expeditions, before Western culture significantly impacted on local practices and ways of thinking. The [[Henry Wilson (sailor)|Wilson]] cabinet of curiosities from [[Palau]] is another example of pre-contact ware. A particularly important group of objects was purchased from the [[London Missionary Society]] in 1911, that includes the unique [[Statue of A'a from Rurutu|statue]] of A'a from Rurutu in the Austral Islands, the rare [[Mangareva Statue|idol]] from Mangareva island and a [[Deity Figure from Rarotonga|figure]] of a god from the Cook Islands. Another highlight is the huge Hawaiian statue of [[Kū|Kū-ka-ili-moku]] or god of war, one of three extant in the world. The Oceanic Collection is also famous for its large Easter Island statues [[Hoa Hakananai'a]] and [[Relocation of moai objects|Moai Hava]].

'''Americas'''
[[File:Mexico Gallery British Museum (2).jpg|thumb|Room 27 - [[Huastec people|Huaxtec]] art on display in the Mexico Gallery]]
The Americas collection mainly consists of 19th and 20th century items although the [[Inca]], [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]], [[Taino]] and other early cultures are well represented. The [[Kayung totem pole]], which was made in the late nineteenth century in the [[Queen Charlotte Islands]], dominates the Great Court and provides a fitting introduction to this very wide ranging collection that stretches from the very north of the North American continent where the [[Inuit]] population has lived for centuries, to the tip of South America where indigenous tribes have long thrived in Patagonia. Highlights of the collection include a spectacular series of Mayan [[Yaxchilan Lintel 24|lintels]] from [[Yaxchilan]], a very high quality Mayan collection that includes sculptures from [[Copán Bench Panel|Copan]], [[Tikal Temple I|Tikal]], [[Tulum Stela 1|Tulum]], [[Pusilha]], [[Naranjo]] and [[Nebaj]] (including the celebrated [[Fenton Vase]]), a collection of turquoise Aztec [[Double-headed serpent|mosaics]] from Mexico (the largest in Europe), important artefacts from [[Teotihuacan Ocelot|Teotihuacan]] and [[Isla de Sacrificios]], several rare Pre-Columbian manuscripts including the [[Codex Zouche-Nuttall]] and [[Codex Waecker-Gotter]], the [[E. G. Squier|Squier]] and [[Edwin Hamilton Davis|Davis]] collection of prehistoric mound relics from North America, a group of [[Zemi Figures from Vere, Jamaica]], a number of prestigious pre-Columbian gold and [[Lake Guatavita|votive]] objects from Colombia and ethnographic objects from across the Amazon region including the [[Robert Hermann Schomburgk|Schomburgk]] collection.

===Department of Coins and Medals===
[[File:Room 68 British Museum.jpg|thumb|Room 68 - The refurbished Money Gallery at the museum]]
The British Museum is home to one of the world's finest [[Numismatics|numismatic]] collections, comprising about a million objects, including coins, medals, tokens and paper money. The collection spans the entire history of coinage from its origins in the 7th century BC to the present day and is representative of both the [[Eastern world|East]] and [[Western world|West]]. As in other parts of the museum, the Department has been able to expand its collection by purchase, donation and bequest. A significant strength of the collection are British coins from all ages, which have benefited from the ancient law of [[Treasure trove|Treasure Trove]].  This has enabled the museum to purchase important [[hoard]]s of gold and silver coins, many of which were buried during periods of crisis or upheaval. There are approximately 9,000 coins, medals and [[banknote]]s on display around the British Museum. More than half of these can be found in the Citi Money Gallery (Gallery 68), while the remainder form part of the permanent displays throughout the Museum. Items from the full collection can be seen by the general public in the Study Room by appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/coins_and_medals/facilities_and_services/study_room.aspx |title=Coins and Medals Study Room|work=British Museum|date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Department of Conservation and Scientific Research===
This department was founded in 1920. [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|Conservation]] has six specialist areas: ceramics &amp; glass; metals; organic material (including textiles); stone, wall paintings and mosaics; Eastern pictorial art and Western pictorial art. The science department&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/science/index.html British Museum – Conservation and Scientific Research&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; has and continues to develop techniques to date artefacts, analyse and identify the materials used in their manufacture, to identify the place an artefact originated and the techniques used in their creation. The department also publishes its findings and discoveries.

===Libraries and Archives===
This department covers all levels of education, from casual visitors, schools, degree level and beyond. The Museum's various libraries hold in excess of 350,000 books, journals and pamphlets covering all areas of the museum's collection. Also the general Museum archives which date from its foundation in 1753 are overseen by this department; the individual departments have their own separate archives and libraries covering their various areas of responsibility, which can be consulted by the public on application.  The [[Anthropology]] Library is especially large, with 120,000 volumes.&lt;ref&gt;See the &quot;Facilities and Services&quot; tab on the home page for each department for details on each library; not all are kept at Bloomsbury. [http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/africa,_oceania,_americas/facilities_and_services.aspx Anthropology Library]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Paul Hamlyn]] Library, which had become the central reference library of the British Museum and the only library there freely open to the general public, closed permanently in August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/news_and_press/statements/paul_hamlyn_library.aspx|title=Paul Hamlyn Library |work=British Museum|accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website and online database of the collection also provide increasing amounts of information.

==British Museum Press==
The British Museum Press (BMP) is the publishing business and a division of the British Museum Company Ltd, a company and a charity (established in 1973) wholly owned by the Trustees of the British Museum.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutbmp&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/services/the_british_museum_press/about_the_british_museum_press.aspx|title=About the BMP |accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BMP publishes both popular and scholarly illustrated books to accompany the exhibition programme and explore aspects of the general collection. Profits from their sales goes to support the British Museum.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutbmp&quot; /&gt;

Scholarly titles are published in the Research Publications series, all of which are [[peer-reviewed]]. This series was started in 1978 and was originally called Occasional Papers. The series is designed to disseminate research on items in the collection. Between six and eight titles are published each year in this series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/publications/research_publications_series.aspx|title=Research Publications |accessdate=2 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
[[File:Elgin Marbles east pediment.jpg|thumb|right|A few of the [[Elgin Marbles]] (also known as the [[Parthenon Marbles]]) from the East [[Pediment]] of the [[Parthenon]].]]

It is a point of controversy whether museums should be allowed to possess artefacts taken from other countries, and the British Museum is a notable target for criticism. The [[Elgin Marbles]], [[Benin Bronzes]] and the [[Rosetta Stone]] are among the most disputed objects in its collections, and organisations have been formed demanding the return of these artefacts to their native countries of [[Greece]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Egypt]] respectively.

The British Museum has refused to return these artefacts, stating that the &quot;restitutionist premise, that whatever was made in a country must return to an original geographical site, would empty both the British Museum and the other great museums of the world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk/gr/andart.html |title=Greek and Roman Antiquities|work=British Museum|date=14 June 2010 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Museum has also argued that the British Museum Act of 1963 legally prevents any object from leaving its collection once it has entered it. Nevertheless, it has returned items such as the Tasmanian Ashes after a 20-year long battle with Australia.&lt;ref name = &quot;ktixsj&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|author=CBC Arts |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2006/03/26/aboriginal-ashes.html |title=Arts – British Museum returns aboriginal ashes to Tasmania |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=26 March 2006 |accessdate=4 July 2010}}{{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Museum continues to assert that it is an appropriate custodian and has an inalienable right to its disputed artefacts under [[British law]].

==Notes==
'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} Sculptures and applied art are in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], the British Museum houses earlier art, non-Western art, prints and drawings, and art of a later date is at [[Tate Modern]]. The National Gallery, holds the National Collection of Western European Art, with [[Tate Britain]] deposited with British Art from 1500.

'''b.''' {{Note label|B|b|none}} By the Act of Parliament it received a name – the British Museum. The origin of the name is not known; the word 'British' had some resonance nationally at this period, so soon after the Jacobite rebellion of 1745; it must be assumed that the Museum was christened in this light.&lt;ref&gt;The question of the use of the term 'British' at this period has recently received some attention, e.g. Colley (1992), 85ff. There never has been a serious attempt to change the Museum's name.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''c.''' {{Note label|C|c|none}} The estimated footage of the various libraries as reported to the Trustees has been summarised by Harris (1998), 3,6: Sloane 4,600, Harley 1,700, Cotton 384, Edwards 576, The Royal Library 1,890.

'''d.''' {{Note label|D|d|none}} This was perhaps rather unfortunate as the title to the house was complicated by the fact that part of the building had been erected on leasehold property (the Crown lease of which ran out in 1771); perhaps that is why [[George III]] paid such a modest price (nominally £28,000) for what was to become Buckingham Palace. See [[Howard Colvin]]''et al.'' (1976), 134.

'''e.''' {{Note label|E|e|none}} Understanding of the foundation of the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] is complicated by the fact that there is no documented history of the institution. At first the National Gallery functioned effectively as part of the British Museum, to which the [[Trustees]] transferred most of their most important pictures (ex. portraits). Full control was handed over to the National Gallery in 1868, after the [[List of Acts of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, 1840–1859|Act of Parliament of 1856]] established the Gallery as an independent body.

'''f.''' {{Note label|F|f|none}} Ashmole, the Keeper of the Greek and Roman Antiquities appreciated the original top-lighting of these galleries and removed the Victorian colour scheme, commenting:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The old Elgin Gallery was painted a deep terracotta red, which, though in some ways satisfactory, diminished its apparent size, and was apt to produce a depressing effect on the visitor. It was decided to experiment with lighter colours, and the walls of the large room were painted with what was, at its first application, a pure cold white, but which after a year's exposure had unfortunately yellowed. The small Elgin Room was painted with pure white tinted with prussian blue, and the Room of the metopes was painted with pure white tinted with cobalt blue and black; it was necessary, for practical reasons, to colour all the dadoes a darker colour&lt;ref&gt;Quoted Ashmole (1994), 125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''g.''' {{Note label|G|g|none}} Ashmole had never liked the Duveen Gallery:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is, I suppose, not positively bad, but it could have been infinitely better. It is pretentious, in that it uses the ancient Marbles to decorate itself. This is a long outmoded idea, and the exact opposite of what a sculpture gallery should do. And, although it incorporates them, it is out of scale, and tends to dwarf them with its bogus Doric features, including those columns, supporting almost nothing which would have made an ancient Greek artist architect wince. The source of daylight is too high above the sculptures, a fault that is only concealed by the amount of reflection from the pinkish marble walls. These are too similar in colour to the marbles...These half-dozen elementary errors were pointed out by everyone in the Museum, and by many scholars outside, when the building was projected.&lt;ref&gt;Ashmole (1994), 126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was not until the 1980s that the installation, of a lighting scheme removed his greatest criticism of the building.
