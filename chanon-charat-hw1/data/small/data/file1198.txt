==Location and view on Abu Sayyaf==

Until his death in a gunbattle on September 4, 2006, [[Khadaffy Janjalani|Khaddafy Janjalani]] was considered the nominal leader of the group by the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]]. His older brother [[Abdulrajak]], the founder of Abu Sayyaf, died in December 1998 in a gun battle with Filipino forces. Khadaffy's death was officially confirmed on January 20, 2007, through [[DNA analysis]] of both brother's remains. Both were natives of [[Isabela City]], currently one of the poorest [[cities of the Philippines]]. Located on the North-Western part of the island of Basilan, Isabela is also the capital of Basilan province, across the Isabela Channel from the Malamwi Island. But Isabela City is administered under the [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] political region north of the island of Basilan, while the rest of the island province of Basilan is now (since 1996) governed as part of the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] (ARMM) to the east.

Consequently, being on the social or political division line, Basilan, Jolo and Sulu have seen some of the fiercest fighting between government troops and the Muslim separatist group Abu Sayyaf through the early 1990s. The Abu Sayyaf primarily operates in the southern Philippines with members traveling to [[Manila]] and other provinces in the country. It was reported that Abu Sayyaf had begun expanding into neighbouring [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]] by the early 1990s.

The Abu Sayyaf is one of the smallest, but strongest of the Islamic separatist groups in the Philippines. Some Abu Sayyaf members have studied or worked in [[Saudi Arabia]] and developed ties to [[mujahadeen]] while fighting and training in the war against the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name = &quot;PacCom&quot;/&gt; Abu Sayyaf proclaimed themselves as [[mujahideen]] and freedom fighters but are not supported by many people in the Philippines including its Muslim [[cleric]]s.

Abu Sayyaf was estimated to have a membership of 200, with an extended membership of over 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;TKBAbu&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCWho&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Who are the Abu Sayyaf |date=December 30, 2000 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/719623.stm | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group was originally not thought to receive funding from outside sources, but intelligence reports from the United States, Indonesia and Australia have found intermittent ties to the Indonesian [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] terrorist group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bomb hits Philippines ferry |publisher=CNN |date=August 28, 2005 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/asiapcf/08/28/philippines.ferry.blast/index.html |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Philippines|Philippine]] government considers the Abu Sayyaf as a part of [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] and notes that initial funding came from [[al-Qaeda]] through the brother-in-law of [[Osama bin Laden]], Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, through Islamic charities in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeAsiaReturn&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=The Return of Abu Sayyaf |date=August 30, 2004 |publisher=Time Asia Magazine |url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/magazine/article/0,13673,501040830-686107,00.html | first=Simon | last=Elegant}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCAirRebel&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Air raids hit Philippines rebels |publisher=BBC |date=November 20, 2004 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4027721.stm | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AsiaWeek: 08.31.1999 |publisher=AsiaWeek |date=August 31, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing ties to Islamist groups in the Middle East indicate that al-Qaeda may be continuing support.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCWho&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gunfight in philippine bomber hunt |publisher=CNN |date=August 10, 2003 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/southeast/08/10/philippine.gunfight/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bin Laden Funds Abu Sayyaf Through Muslim Relief Group |date=August 9, 2000 |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani’s first recruits were soldiers of the [[Moro National Liberation Front]] (M.N.L.F.) and the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (M.I.L.F.). However, the M.I.L.F. and M.N.L.F. deny having links with Abu Sayyaf. Both officially distance themselves from Abu Sayyaf because of its attacks on civilians and its supposed profiteering. The Philippine military, however, has claimed that elements of both groups provide support to the Abu Sayyaf.

==History==
In the early 1970s, the [[Moro National Liberation Front]] (M.N.L.F.) was the main Muslim rebel groups fighting in Basilan and Mindanao in the southern Philippines.&lt;ref name=&quot;TKBAbu&quot; /&gt;

[[Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani]], the older brother of [[Khadaffy Janjalani]], had been a teacher from Basilan, who later studied Islamic [[theology]] and [[Arabic]] in Libya, [[Syria]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] during the 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;PacCom&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Abu Sayyaf History |publisher=U.S. Pacific Command |date=September 21, 2006 |url=http://www.pacom.mil/piupdates/abusayyafhist.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCWho&quot; /&gt; Abdurajik then went to Afghanistan to fight against the [[Soviet Union]] and the Afghan government during the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]] in the 1980s. During that period, he is alleged to have met Osama Bin Laden and been given $6 million to establish a more Islamic group with the M.N.L.F. in the southern Philippines, made up of members of the extant M.N.L.F.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Funding Terrorism in Southeast Asia: The Financial Network of Al Qaeda and Jemaah Islamiyah |url=http://www.nbr.org/publications/analysis/pdf/vol14no5.pdf |publisher=The National Bureau of Asian Research |accessdate=September 20, 2006|format=PDF| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060927184541/http://www.nbr.org/publications/analysis/pdf/vol14no5.pdf| archivedate= September 27, 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By then, as a political solution in the southern Philippines, ARMM had been established in 1989.

===Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani leadership (1989–1998)===
M.N.L.F. had moderated into an established political government, the ARMM. It was established in 1989, fully institutionalized by 1996 and which eventually became the ruling government in southern Mindanao.

When Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani returned home to Basilan island in 1990, he gathered radical members of the old M.N.L.F. who wanted to resume armed struggle for an independent Islamic state and in 1991 established the Abu Sayyaf.&lt;ref name=&quot;TKBAbu&quot; /&gt;

By 1995 Abu Sayyaf was active in large scale bombings and attacks in the Philippines. The Abu Sayyaf's first attack was the assault on the town of [[Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay|Ipil]] in [[Mindanao]] in April 1995. This year also marked the escape of 20 year old Khadaffy Janjalani from [[Camp Crame]] in [[Manila]] along with another member named Jovenal Bruno.

On December 18, 1998, Abdurajik Abubakar Janjalani was killed in a gun battle with the [[Philippine National Police]] on Basilan Island.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeAsiaReturn&quot; /&gt; He is thought to have been about age 39 at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCWho&quot; /&gt; The death of Aburajik Abubakar Janjalani marked a turning point in Abu Sayyaf operations, shifting from its ideological focus to more general kidnappings, murders and robberies, as the younger brother Khadaffy Janjalani succeeded Abdurajak.

===Khadaffy Janjalani leadership (1999–2007)===
The 23 year-old Khadaffy Janjalani then took leadership of one of Abu Sayyaf's factions in an internecine struggle.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeAsiaReturn&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCFresh&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Fresh fighting in S Philippines |publisher=BBC |date=September 7, 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/5322680.stm | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then worked to consolidate his leadership of the Abu Sayyaf, causing the group to appear inactive for a period. After Janjalani's leadership was secured, the Abu Sayyaf began a new strategy, as they proceeded to take hostages.

The group's motive for kidnapping became more financial than religious during the period of Khadaffy's leadership, according to locals in the areas associated with Abu Sayyaf. The hostage money is probably the method of financing of the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;NBR&quot; /&gt;
The group expanded its operations to [[Malaysia]] in 2000 when it abducted foreigners from two resorts. This action was condemned by most leaders in the Islamic world.
[[File:Terhapilon2000.jpg|left|thumb|[[Isnilon Totoni Hapilon]] in 2000.]]

It was also responsible for the kidnapping and murder of more than 30 foreigners and Christian clerics and workers, including Martin and [[Gracia Burnham]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNCapture&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Manilla captures senior Abu Sayyaf |publisher=CNN |date=December 7, 2003 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/southeast/12/07/philippines.abusayyaf/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ex-hostage describes jungle ordeal |publisher=CNN |date=May 9, 2003 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/05/08/cnna.burnham/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A commander named [[Abu Sabaya]] was killed in 2002 while trying to evade forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;ict&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Prominent Abu Sayyaf Commander Believed Dead |url=http://www.ict.org.il/spotlight/det.cfm?id=796 |publisher=Institute for Counter-Terrorism |accessdate=September 20, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060105081224/http://www.ict.org.il/spotlight/det.cfm?id=796 |archivedate = January 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galib Andang, one of the leaders of the group, was captured in [[Sulu Province|Sulu]] in December 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeAsiaReturn&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNCapture&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCProfiles&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Profiles of dead Abu Sayyaf leaders |publisher=BBC |date=March 15, 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4350033.stm | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCBloody&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Bloody end to Manila jail break |publisher=BBC |date=March 15, 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4349471.stm | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An explosion at a military base in Jolo on February 18, 2006 was blamed on Abu Sayyaf by Brig. General Alexander Aleo, an Army officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Blast at US Philippines army base |publisher=BBC |date=February 18, 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4727842.stm | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jainal Antel Sali, Jr.jpg|thumb|[[Jainal Antel Sali, Jr.]]]]
Khadaffy Janjalani was indicted in the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]] for his alleged involvement in terrorist attacks, including hostage taking by Abu Sayyaf and murder, against United States nationals and other foreign nationals in and around the Republic of the Philippines.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCIndict&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=US indicts Abu Sayyaf leaders |publisher=BBC |date=July 23, 2002 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2147381.stm | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consequently on February 24, 2006, Janjalani was among six fugitives in the second and most recent group of indicted fugitives to be added to the [[FBI Most Wanted Terrorists]] list along with two fellow members of the Abu Sayyaf, including [[Isnilon Totoni Hapilon]] and [[Jainal Antel Sali, Jr.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNFBI&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=FBI puts al-Zarqawi high on its list |date=February 24, 2006 |publisher=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/02/24/zarqawi.mostwanted/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HouseIndict&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Tiahrt responds to the Abu Sayyaf terrorist indictments |publisher=United States House of Representatives |url=http://www.house.gov/tiahrt/communications/press_releases/2002/07232002.htm |accessdate=September 20, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060910033008/http://www.house.gov/tiahrt/communications/press_releases/2002/07232002.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = September 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 13, 2006, it was reported that Abu Sayyaf members may have been planning attacks during the [[ASEAN]] summit in the Philippines. The group was reported to have been training alongside Jemaah Islamiyah militants. The plot was reported to have involved detonating a car bomb in Cebu City where the summit was scheduled to take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Manila Again Denies Terror Plot Led to Postponement of Asia Summits |date=December 13, 2006 |publisher=Voice of America (VoA) |url=http://voanews.com/english/2006-12-13-voa11.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 27, 2006, the Philippine military reported that Janjalani's remains had been recovered near Patikul, in Jolo in the southern Philippines and that DNA tests had been ordered to confirm the discovery. He was allegedly shot in the neck in an encounter with government troops on September on Luba Hills, Patikul town in Sulu.

In 2009, with the shooting of two United States soldiers, Abu Sayyaf was again put in the international spotlight.

Abu Solaiman a soldier of the Abu Sayyaf was killed by government troops on January 16, 2007.

On May 3, 2000, Abu Sayyaf guerillas occupied the [[Malaysia]]n dive resort island [[Sipadan]] and took 21 [[hostage]]s, including 10 tourists and 11 resort workers – 19 non-Filipino nationals in total.

Two Muslim Malaysians were released soon after, however Abu Sayyaf made various demands for the release of several prisoners, including [[1993 World Trade Center bombing|1993 World Trade Center bomber]] [[Ramzi Yousef]] and $2.4 million. In July, a Filipino television evangelist and 12 of his crew offered their help and went as mediators for the relief of other hostages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jmcim.org|title=jmcim.org|publisher=|accessdate=November 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They, three French television crew members and a German journalist, all visiting Abu Sayyaf on Jolo, were also taken hostage.&lt;ref name = &quot;cdnn&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=FREEMAN WASHINGTON|url=http://www.cdnn.info/news/industry/i000910.html|title=Abu Sayyaf Muslim rebels raped Sipadan dive tourist hostages| newspaper=[[CDNN]] |date=September 10, 2000 |accessdate=March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most hostages were released in August and September 2000, partly due to mediation by Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] and an offer of $25 million in &quot;development aid&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/898190.stm |title=BBC news.uk |publisher=BBC News |date=August 28, 2000 |accessdate=April 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abu Sayyaf conducted a second raid on the island of Pandanan near Sipadan on September 10 and seized three more Malaysians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdnn.info/special-report/sipadan/sipadan_timeline.html |title=www.cdnn.info |publisher=cdnn.info |accessdate=April 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippine army launched a major offensive on September 16, 2000, rescuing all remaining hostages, except Filipino dive instructor Roland Ullah. He was eventually freed in 2003.&lt;ref name = &quot;gmaabusayyaf&quot;/&gt;

====Jeffrey Schilling====

Jeffrey Schilling, an American citizen and Muslim convert, was held by Abu Sayyaf for 8 months after being captured while visiting a terrorist camp with his wife, Ivy Osani. Abu Sayyaf demanded a $10 million ransom for his release, but Schilling escaped after more than 7 months and was picked up by the Philippine Marine Corps on April 12, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/04/02/world/main283170.shtml |work=CBS News |date=April 12, 2001 |title=US Hostage Freed in Philippines }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0207/23/bn.01.html |title=Larry Thompson, Deputy Attorney General (Live Transcript) |date=July 23, 2002 |publisher=CNN International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many commentators have been critical of Schilling, who had reportedly walked into the camp. Schilling claims to have been invited by his wife's distant cousin who was a member of Abu Sayyaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/04/14/MNE165246.DTL |title= What Was Schilling Thinking?

====Martin and Gracia Burnham====
{{See also|Dos Palmas kidnappings}}
On May 27, 2001, an Abu Sayyaf raid kidnapped about 20 people from Dos Palmas, an expensive resort in Honda Bay, to the north of [[Puerto Princesa City]] on the island of [[Palawan]], which had been &quot;considered completely safe&quot;. The most &quot;valuable&quot; of the hostages were three North Americans, Martin and Gracia Burnham, a [[missionary]] couple, and Guillermo Sobero, a Peruvian-American tourist who was later [[Decapitation|beheaded]] by Abu Sayyaf, for whom Abu Sayyaf demanded $1&amp;nbsp;million in [[ransom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsstand.blogs.com/newsstand/2007/01/turns_out_abu_s.html Gracia's enemies newsstand.blogs.com]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hostages and hostage-takers then returned hundreds of kilometres back across the [[Sulu Sea]] to the Abu Sayyaf's territories in Mindanao.&lt;ref name=Bowden2007p54&gt;&quot;Manhunt&quot; by Mark Bowden, ''The Atlantic'', March 2007, p.54 (15)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to author [[Mark Bowden]], the leader of the raid was [[Abu Sabaya]]. According to [[Gracia Burnham]], she told her husband &quot;to identify his kidnappers&quot; to authorities &quot;as 'the Osama bin Laden Group,' but Burnham was unfamiliar with that name and stuck with&quot; Abu Sayyaf. After returning to Mindanao, Abu Sayyaf operatives conducted numerous raids, &quot;including one at a coconut plantation called Golden Harvest; they took about 15 people captive there and later used [[bolo knife|bolo knives]] to hack the heads off two men. The number of hostages waxed and waned as some were ransomed and released, new ones were taken and others were killed.&quot;&lt;ref name=Bowden2007p54 /&gt;

On June 7, 2002, about a year after the raid, Philippine army troops conducted a rescue operation in which two of the three hostages held, Martin Burnham and Filipino nurse, Ediborah Yap, were killed. The remaining hostage was wounded and the hostage takers escaped.

In July 2004, Gracia Burnham [[Testimony|testified]] at a trial of eight Abu Sayyaf members and identified six of the suspects as being her erstwhile captors, including Alhamzer Limbong, Abdul Azan Diamla, Abu Khari Moctar, Bas Ishmael, Alzen Jandul, and Dazid Baize.

&quot;The eight suspects sat silently during her three-hour testimony, separated from her by a wooden grill. They face the death sentence if found guilty of kidnapping for ransom. The trial began this year and is not expected to end for several months.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.graciaburnham.org/pdf/Article_7-30-04.pdf |title=Burham identifies former Abu Captors |format=PDF |accessdate=April 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alhamzer Limbong was later killed in a [[Prison riot|prison uprising]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.graciaburnham.org/index.asp?sec=3_1 Philippines Brace for Retaliation]&quot; March 15, 2005, ''Associated Press''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gracia Burnham has claimed that Philippine military officials were colluding with her captors, saying that the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] &quot;didn't pursue us...As time went on, we noticed that they never pursued us&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=XtE5QEW0ukUC&amp;dq=In+the+Presence+of+My+Enemies&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=aBsO-csyzG&amp;sig=lwOf29qR-dcKscY3A-_qNV0QnJ0&amp;prev=http://www.google.com/search%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3DIn%2Bthe%2BPresence%2Bof%2BMy%2BEnemies%26btnG%3DGoogle%2BSearch&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=print&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=2 |title='&amp;#39;In the Presence of My Enemies'&amp;#39; |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=April 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Journalists abducted since 2000====
[[ABS–CBN Corporation|ABS-CBN]]'s ''Newsbreak'' reported that Abu Sayyaf abducted at least 20 journalists since 2000 (mostly foreign journalists) and all of them were eventually released upon payment of [[ransom]].

[[Ces Drilon]] and cameramen Jimmy Encarnacion and Angelo Valderama were the latest of its kidnap victims. The journalists held captive were
#[[GMA Network|GMA-7]] television reporter Susan Enriquez (April 2000, [[Basilan]], a few days);
#10 Foreign journalists (7 German, 1 French, 1 Australian and 1 Danish, on May 2000, [[Jolo]], for 10 hours);
#German Andreas Lorenz of the magazine [[Der Spiegel]] (July 2000, Jolo, for 25 days; he was also kidnapped in May);
#French television reporter Maryse Burgot and cameraman Jean-Jacques Le Garrec and sound technician Roland Madura (July 2000, Jolo, for 2 months);
#ABS-CBN television reporter Maan Macapagal and cameraman Val Cuenca (July 2000, Jolo, for 4 days);
#[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] contributor and Net 25 television reporter Arlyn de la Cruz (January 2002, [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]], for 3 months)
#GMA-7 television reporter Carlo Lorenzo and cameraman Gilbert Ordiales (September 2002, Jolo, for 6 days).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rp3.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/06/12/08/abu-sayyaf-abducted-20-journalists-2000 |title=Abu Sayyaf abducted 20 journalists since 2000 |publisher=Rp3.abs-cbnnews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three ICRC workers had finished conducting field work in Sulu province, located in the southwest of the country, when they were abducted by an unknown group, later confirmed as Abu Sayyaf leader [[Albader Parad]]'s group. Parad himself was said to be involved in the kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Julie |last=Alipala |title=3 Red Cross kidnap victims alive, safe |work= |page= |date=2009-01-17 |accessdate=31 March 2009 |quote= |url=http://www.inquirer.net/specialreports/redcrossabduction/view.php?db=1&amp;article=20090117-183958 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All three workers were eventually released. According to a CNN story, Parad was reportedly killed, along with five other militants, in an assault raid by Philippine marines in Sulu province on Sunday, February 21, 2010.

===Superferry 14 Bombing===
{{Main|Superferry 14 }}

[[Superferry 14]] was a large ferry destroyed by a bomb on February 27, 2004, killing 116 people in the [[Philippines]]' worst terrorist attack and the world's deadliest terrorist attack at sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rommel C. Banlaoi|title=Maritime Terrorism in Southeast Asia: The Abu Sayyaf Threat|url=http://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/f54ece77-3d67-4c32-bfaa-02b476a569d8/Maritime-Terrorism-in-Southeast-Asia--The-Abu-Sayy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On that day, the 10,192 [[ton]] ferry sailed out of [[Manila]] with about 900 passengers and crew on board. A television set filled with 8&amp;nbsp;lb. (4 kilograms) of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] had been placed on board. 90 minutes out of port, the bomb exploded. 63 people were killed instantly and 53 went missing and presumed dead.

Despite claims from terrorist groups, the blast was initially thought to have been an accident caused by a gas explosion. However, after divers righted the ferry five months after it had sunk, they found evidence of a bomb blast.

==Funding==

The group obtains most of its financing through [[ransom]] and extortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rommel C. Banlaoi|title=The Sources of Abu Sayyaf's Resilience in the Southern Philippines|url=https://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/the-sources-of-the-abu-sayyaf’s-resilience-in-the-southern-philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt; One report estimated its revenues from ransom payments in 2000 alone between $10 and $25 million. According to the State Department, it may also receive funding from radical Islamic benefactors in the Middle East and South Asia.

It was reported that Libya facilitated ransom payments to Abu Sayyaf. Libya was also suggested that Libyan money could possibly be channeled to Abu Sayyaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Niksch, Larry |title=Abu Sayyaf: Target of Philippine-U.S. Anti-Terrorism Cooperation |publisher=Federation of American Scientists |date=January 25, 2002 |work=CRS Report for Congress |url=http://www.fas.org/irp/crs/RL31265.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian intelligence agencies connected with [[Victor Bout]]'s planes have reportedly provided Abu Sayyaf with arms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isn.ethz.ch/isn/Current-Affairs/Security-Watch/Detail/?id=88499&amp;lng=en The deadly convenience of Victor Bout]. ISN Eth Zurich. June 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/mar/06/viktor-bout-background Background: the life of Viktor Bout]. The Guardian. March 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military action==
The military has intensified its intelligence operation against the Abu Sayyaf following the arrest of a [[Filipino-American]] allegedly selling illegal weapons to the Al-Qaeda linked group. Security forces have arrested Victor Moore Infante in Zamboanga for selling weapons to the extremist group. The 34-year old man was tagged by authorities as &quot;one of the United States most wanted fugitives.&quot;

His arrest was made secret and announced by the Bureau of Immigration and Deportation. Infante, who was reported to have traveled to Basilan, a stronghold of the Abu Sayyaf, had been deported to Guam. Federal agents escorted the Filipino-American, who was also suspected of planning to smuggle illegal drugs to the Philippines. United States authorities have issued a warrant for the arrest of Infante in New York after Customs men in July 2003 seized one of his package from Oakland containing weapons’ parts addressed to his safehouse in Zamboanga City.

&quot;His arrest and deportation is another big step in our campaign against terrorism because this man is known to have aided the Abu Sayyaf in acquiring weapons used by the group in committing atrocities against our soldiers and civilians,&quot; Philippine immigration chief Andrea Domingo said in a statement.

==Targeting the United States==
Most of the Abu Sayyaf victims have been Filipinos. However, non-Filipinos have also been taken hostage for large ransom payment demands. Westerners, especially Americans, have been targeted for political and racial reasons.

In 1993, Abu Sayyaf kidnapped an American Bible translator in the southern Philippines. In 2000, Abu Sayyaf captured an American Muslim visiting Jolo and demanded that the United States release [[Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman]] and [[Ramzi Yousef]], who were jailed for their involvement in the [[World Trade Center bombing]] of 1993.

A spokesman for the Abu Sayyaf has stated that, &quot;We have been trying hard to get an American because they may think we are afraid of them.&quot; He added, &quot;We want to fight the American people.&quot;

British, Canadian, Australian, French, and German tourists have been kidnapped as well.

==Criticism==
The [[Foreign relations of Libya|Libyan envoy]] accused the group of inhumanity and violating the tenets of Islam by holding innocent people. Abdul Rajab Azzarouq, former ambassador to the Philippines, criticised the [[kidnappers]] for holding people who have nothing to do with the conflict. The hostage-takers should not use religion as a reason to keep the hostages isolated from their families, he said.

Sheikh [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] in Qatar has denounced the kidnapping and killings committed by the Abu Sayyaf towards civilians and foreigners, asserting that they are not part of the dispute between the Abu Sayyaf and the Philippines government. He stated that it is shameful to commit such acts in the name of the Islamic faith, saying that such acts produce backlashes against Islam and Muslims worldwide. It is known that Qaradawi supports the rights of Muslims in Philippines. Qaradawi spoke of the importance of education in the life of Muslims, stating that educational institutions in the Muslim world should review their educational philosophy in order that it may reflect Islamic values aiming to create pious Muslims good to themselves and non-Muslims as well.

The [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation|Organisation of the Islamic Conference]] (OIC) condemned the Sipadan kidnapping and offered to help secure their release. OIC Secretary General [[Azeddine Laraki]] who represents the world's largest Islamic body, told the Philippine government he was prepared to send an envoy to help save the hostages and issued a statement condemning the rebels. &quot;The Secretary General has pointed out that this operation and the like are rejected by divine laws and that they are neither the appropriate nor correct means to resolve conflicts,&quot; the statement said.

Mark Bowden in a piece in ''The Atlantic'' on the Martin and [[Gracia Burnham]] kidnapping and captivity, describes the couple as &quot;gently engaged their captors in theological discussion&quot; and finding these &quot;[[jihad]]ists&quot; to be shallow, even adolescent, in their faith. Unfamiliar with the [[Qur'an]], the outlaws had only a sketchy notion of Islam, which they saw as a set of behavioral rules, to be violated when it suited them. Kidnapping, murder and theft were justified by their special status as [[mujahideen|holy warriors]]. One by one they sexually appropriated several of the women captives, claiming them as &quot;wives&quot;.&lt;ref name=Bowden2007p60&gt;&quot;Manhunt&quot; by Mark Bowden ''The Atlantic'', March 2007, p.60&lt;/ref&gt;
